## Rent a table OR leave it to the club

The  club's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  allow  individuals to rent tables this year. The cost for one table will  be  $15  for  members  and  $20  for  non-members. Contact me for details.

Fleamarket  forms  will  be  available  at  both  September meetings.  Items  will  be  collected  at  both  September meetings, but only at the By-the-Loop meeting in October. So dust off your extra hardware and software, bring it in, and let the club do the rest. Below is a list of collectors for fleamarket items if you cannot attend a meeting.

## Executive Update

## The latest from Bill McEwen

August 8, 2000 - Greetings to the Global Amiga Family

It  has  been a hectic several weeks, and we are moving even faster this week.

There will be some new announcements in the next few days that should be of interest to everyone as we work hard to expand the members of the Amiga family. [See the club website. …Editor]

I  would like to say a big 'Thank You' to everyone who attended the show in Sacramento California, and another special thank you to John and Jan Zacharius and the rest of the SACC team. They did a great job.

I  am writing this letter as a quick answer to some questions that I have received in the last 48 hours.

As  mentioned  before,  if  you  hear  something  that  you need to confirm, ask. Every member of the Amiga team is more than willing to answer questions. It gets somewhat tiresome  to  constantly  get  rumors  sent  to  us  after  they have been out there for several days or even weeks.

Here  are  answers  to  two  rumors  that  need  to  be  addressed immediately:

1. Once you sell the remaining A1200's you are pulling out of Germany.

Answer:  No.  We  have  no  plans  of  pulling  out  of Germany. In fact we are looking at ways to increase our presence in all of Europe, Asia, South America, and even here  in  North  America.  There  are  several  ideas  on  the table, and even some names have been attached to the ideas. There will more information available when we are ready to share the plans.

We are certainly not going to disregard the business in these  markets.  We  are  a  growing  company  and  very excited about the future.

2. You are going to begin selling new A4000's and there are already 1,000 of these new A4000's being built.

Answer:  Who  came  up  with  this  one?  There  is  no manufacturing  of  any  Amiga  except  the  new  desktop, notebook, and handheld in the works.

I have asked before, and now I will ask again, please stop these rumors. If you hear one, contact any member of the Amiga Team directly, and we will answer you.

Thank you for your continued support. Kindest regards, Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga Team.

In  Response  to  Community  Concerns  Posted  on

## From Amiga Inc.

We are very excited at the response that we have received in the first few weeks of the Amiga SDK version 1 going out into the world. We have received lots of feedback, mostly  good,  some  not  so  good,  and  three  particular points have come up that we would like to address before they become common untruths.

Firstly, it is true that the Amiga Foundation Layer which ships  on  the  SDK  does  not  have  memory  protection. However,  this  does  not  mean  that  AmiTM,  the  next generation  Amiga  Digital  Environment  will  not  have memory protection. A comment made in an article in the last AmigaWorld seems to have been interpreted in such a way as to suggest that this is the case when in fact the ý

point  being  made  was  that  Amiga  is  looking  at  many solutions  for  providing  robustness  and  security.  AmiTM will  provide  a  robust,  secure  environment  and  we  will use the most elegant and effective means to achieve this.

Secondly, the End User Licence Agreement that made it into the SDK is in error as a result of a legal misinterpretation. There is NO ROYALTY to be paid for any application either created with the SDK or which will run on AmiTM. Amiga will be creating a scheme in which third parties can pay a royalty to Amiga in exchange for official Amiga certification,  branding  and  promotion.  This  provides  a revenue stream to Amiga and a value add for the third party. This scheme is entirely voluntary.

The third point has been drawn as a conclusion from the first  two,  namely that Amiga is abandoning the desktop market.  Nothing  could  be  further  from  the  truth.  The announced AmigaOne will feature processor options ý

## September Calendar

Sep 11 - Amiga By-The-Loop Chapter 7:30 pm - N.Richland Hills Community Ctr. Loop 820 at Rufe Snow, N.Richland Hills

ranging from 600 Mhz to 1 Ghz, with other, even more powerful  devices  already  on  the  drawing  board. The conclusion to be drawn from this is either that Amiga is very committed to the desktop market or that we are going to build one mother of a cellphone.

We are committed to making the Amiga THE best computer system in the world. Yes we are also going to go into  other  markets,  but  that  does  not  mean  we  are abandoning  the  desktop,  the  Amiga  philosophy  or  the loyal Amigans who have stood by the platform through the good and the bad.
