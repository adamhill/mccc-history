## March News

## by Fabian Jimenez, NCAUG

With  the  recent  demise  of  Phase5,  it  is  apparent  that Haage &amp; Partner's Warp Up will be the Power PC standard of default for the Classic Amiga line. Paul Sadlik will demo  Warp  Up  versions  of  datatypes,  media  players, games and the latest WarpUp Power PC software for the Amiga.

Amiga's Intent

Well, the best source of news on Amiga's future plans has been the monthly conference given by Fleecy Moss on AmigaZone (www.amigazone.com). If you are a member, then you  can  participate during the conference. Otherwise, you have to wait until a edited transcript is released for download a few days later.

During  the  February  23rd  conference,  Fleecy  revealed that  Amiga  has  a  new  VP  of  Operations  named  Vince Pfeiffer. This adds to the known Amiga board members of Bill  McEwen,  Randy  Hughes,  and  Fleecy.  Fleecy  also mentions  that  venerable  Amiga  hardware  guru  Dean Brown [DKB] has been hired as part of Amiga's development team. More names and partners are expected to be revealed shortly.

Fleecy also stated that Amiga has hired a development team, a developer support manager, and a management team of 14. The AAC [Amiga Advisory Council] has been restarted,  and  they  are  trying  to  get  the  ADN  [Amiga Developer Network] moving again. Information is to be posted shortly on a new website. I wonder with Fleecy mentioning the ADN if Kermit [Kermit Woodall of Nova Design] is involved, as he was in the past? If so, then it marks  yet  another  popular  Amigan's  involvement  with the new Amiga plans.

With respect to the user community, Fleecy mentioned that the AAC will be developed to its full potential. Not known at this time is if the folks originally mentioned to comprise the AAC [launched on August 6, 1999] will be the  same  as  before.  As  you  recall,  the  AAC  was  comprised  of  an  Amiga  representative,  users,  dealers,  and developers. Their purpose was to serve as a means for which  Amiga  would  interface  and  support  the  Amiga community.

## Amiga 2K Show

On April 1st, Bob Scharp will be having yet another show in St. Louis. If you do plan to go and attend the banquet, remember that you must send in your ticket order shortly. If not, then you will pay the higher door rates as well as be shut out of the banquet dinner. Bill McEwen will be the main speaker at this event. Also expected are demos of TAO's Intent, the foundation of the new Amiga's OS environment.

Several Amiga dealers and user groups will be present at the show. [At this time, NCAUG will not be sponsoring a table at the show.] Famous Amiga developers like Kermit Woodall's  Nova  Design  and  Haage  and  Partner  are scheduled to appear. For more information surf on over to http://www.amigastl.com/show.html.

A  video  conference  sponsored  by  Amiga  from  the Gateway  Amiga's  March  1st  club  meeting  has  been cancelled.  However,  Bob  stated  that  planning  such  an event served as a very educative experience.

## Life After Amiga Web Directory

Many Amigans were saddened when CUCUG announced the end of their Amiga Web Directory service. However, a plethora of web sites have filled the void left by AWD. As I  have mentioned before, if you wish to keep on top of the  latest  Amiga  developments,  I  suggest  the  following web pages: Amiga Network News which is a digest of USENET fodder (http://www.ann.lu), Amiga.org which has news links and information, Czech Amiga News for news links also (http://www.realdreams.czlamiga), and  a newcomer  called  Amiga-News.de  (http:/Iwww.amiganews.de/indexe.shtml).

Speaking of Amiga web stuff, have you been on e-Bay recently?  Besides  getting  our  own  Amiga  category  on their web site, it seems that some dealers have decided to move their wares using e-Bay. In particular, I have noticed Devine  Computer  and  Centsible  Software  filling  pages with their items. Buyer beware is all I will say.

## aDSL Angst

Well, one of the unfortunate things about my new house is that my modem can only achieve 33K bps on the noisy phone line. I think it has something to do with my alarm system patched in on the line. My solution? I looked into many things to replace my dial up connection with. The best deal was aDSL for about $50 a month.

Now despite all the ads you see in the papers, all aDSL connections  to  your  home  [in  the  Washington  D.C. region] are subcontracted out to Bell Atlantic. This means if Bell Atlantic hasn't wired your neighborhood yet, then no one will be able to install it for you. A handy utility on

## April Calendar

Apr 10 Amiga By-The-Loop Chapter 7:30 pm - N.Richland Hills Community Ctr. Loop 820 at Rufe Snow, N.Richland Hills

Apr 10 -  MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approx. 10:00 pm - TGI Friday's Loop 820 &amp; Bedford Euless Road

Apr 20 Amiga North Dallas Chapter 7:30 pm - SMU Building Collins Blvd. &amp; International Pkwy, Richardson

Apr 22 Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am their web site can check to see if your phone number can do  aDSL  yet.  Chances  are  it  will  tell  you  that  aDSL  is available  in  your  area,  but  not  for  your  specific  phone line. They are nice enough to notify you when aDSL is available on your line, but they won't tell you when that will be.

There is something called sDSL that most providers can install  on  your  line  without  waiting  for  Bell  Atlantic.  It offers a higher bandwidth, but also a higher bill at about $100 a month. It's a better deal than ISDN though.

What about cable modems? Well, Montgomery County offers  a  buggered  up  system  in  comparison  to  Fairfax County. You must have a modem dial-up to send requests that  are  eventually  sent  back  to  your  machine  via  the cable  system.  CabIeTV  Montgomery  naturally  only supports  Windows  machines,  but  I  guess  you  can  get Miami DX to figure things out. My bandwidth sucks.

## Quote of the Week

'Dean was one of the board members of the infamous ICOA with Fleecy, so you see why he was such a likely choice  to  get  onboard  Bill  'n  Fleecy  Convergence Computers, Inc. (BFCCI)'

- …Jason Compton on c.s.a.misc

Jason has been a little grumpy lately. He also coined the famous FIAM, Fleecy's Initiative Acronymn of the Month.
