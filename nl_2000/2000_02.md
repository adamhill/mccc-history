## Amiga and Tao-Group

## A strategic alliance

Las Vegas, NV January 8, 2000 - Amiga begins expressing plans for the new Amiga with a strategic alliance with Tao-Group.

'Things started going wrong the moment the PC rode into town and the  home  computer  revolution  of  the  1980s ground to a halt. We are here to right that wrong.' said Bill  McEwen,  Amiga's  El  Presidente.  'We  kind  of  feel guilty about not having been around to show the world the evils of the PC, but inept management sent the Amiga off to a bad place. Luckily, its users and developers have kept it alive, and now we are back.'

'Existing  products  are  very  rude.'  He  continued. 'Shoving  PCI  slots,  interrupts,  file  systems,  registries, megahertz,  and  megabytes  right  into  your  face.  My grandmother just wants to play a game, or send an email, or draw a picture. She doesn't want to have to mortgage the house and get a masters degree.'

'Digital  Technology has become stalled because of the predominance  of  Windows.'  quiped  in  Fleecy  Moss. 'Putting a thousand monkeys on typewriters may eventually  produce  the  works  of  Shakespeare  but  it's  not something you're going to want to wait around for, and you don't want to be responsible for cleaning up the mess in the meantime.'

'Our  approach  is  outrageous.  WE  look  at  what  actual people want, and then give them the most simple, elegant solution. Even calling it computing is falling into the PC trap.  It  is  participation  in  the  digital  content  universe, whether it be developing an application, playing a game, making  your  own  video,  watching  TV  or  buying  S&amp;M gear  online.  Computing  companies  are  trying  to  paint digital  convergence  as  computers  and  TVs  coming together, so they can stick 'TV' in front of PC and continue to sell the same old garbage. Digital Convergence is something  much  bigger  though.  It  is  about  content, information,  services,  and  activity  transforming  into  a digital format and coming together in a single place that has no boundaries. If someone tells you you need a PC to get into this new content universe, smile nicely and hit them with a big stick.'

'Elegance, simplicity, invisible and universal technology.' sings  Bill  McEwen,  trying  to  get  a  word  in  edgeways. 'That is why we are just giddy to be working with the Tao Group. Others rant on about how their products are next generation,  warp  capable,  but  the  truth  is  that  most  of them are based upon old concepts and architectures that's  why you need the latest monster machine just to type letters. Chris Hinsley (CTO/Tao Group) was one of those smartass child prodigies you wanted to beat up at school.  By  age  20,  he  had  already  been  a  commercial games developer for 5 years, and wrote some great Amiga games.  Being  a  smartass  though,  he  saw  the  future, realised nothing out there was ready for it, and dedicated the  last  ten  years  of  his  life  to  making  sure  the  human race was ready when the future arrived.'

'The Amiga was special because it refused to settle for second  best.  If  something  is  worth  doing,  it  is  worth doing right, and the proof of that is in the global following that it still has today. With the nightmare of the past five  years  behind  us,  the  Amiga  is  ready  to  push  out ahead again, and save the future from a muddled, poorly fitting, frustrating PC enema. With the foundation that the Tao  Group  gives  us,  we  are  ready  to  re-introduce  the world to a novel computer concept - fun.'

'We aren't stupid enough to think it's going to be easy,' interrupts Fleecy Moss, shoving McEwen to the ground and  gagging  him.  'A  lot  of  people  have  been  brainwashed by the advertisements and the slick salespeople. However, the digital information revolution is all around us,  waiting  to  happen.  Everyone  can  feel  it,  everyone wants to be a part of it. Amiga is going to stick a pretty big bomb under that PC logjam and blow it clean back to Redmond.  Elegance,  simplicity,  invisible  and  universal technology. Time to start smiling again.'

'We are happier than a crocodile at a waterpark to be working  with  Amiga.'  said  Francis  Charig,  CEO  and international stud. 'We are very proud of what we have created in our garden shed. We could have sold out long ago, but the market was crowded with companies doing that so we decided to actual create a product and make it a good one. Now we are finding that OEMs are seeing our product and getting even more excited about it than we  are  ourselves;  it  almost  makes  the  whipping  and torture  we  have  had  to  inflict  on  our  employees worthwhile. An Amiga solution powered by Tao technology is a match made in heaven for everyone.'

## BBS Closes

## A victim of Y2K and the Internet

Bet you thought the year 2000 arrived smoothly didn't you? Well, for the most part, it did. But there was at least one victim - the MCCC BBS. The software that the BBS

Feb 26 Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am was running on had several bugs that showed up after the first  of  the  year.  They  rendered  several  important functions - like searching for new files - inoperable. But even worse, the bugs made the BBS unstable. Our first hard drive crash took a couple of hours to recover from… and even then left us with no user files. The second crash forced a quick decision to shut it down. The decision was based on the facts that:

- The BBS software hasn't been upgraded in about a year and a half - a victim of apathy in this new world of the Internet - so the bugs were there to stay.
- The use of the BBS has fallen to very low levels due to reduced need and declining club membership.
- The effort of installing new software far outweighed any benefit.

Refunds  will  be  made  in  the  form  of  extended  AGM memberships - one month for two.
