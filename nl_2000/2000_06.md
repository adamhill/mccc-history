## From the MCCC News

On May 10-12, Commodore wizard, James Butterfield, came  to  the  Metroplex  under  the  sponsorship  of  the MCCC and Scope User Groups. Meeting at the Western Hills  Inn,  the  events  included  an  informal  banquet,  an entertaining lecture and learning sessions on topcs from file  handling to machine language. We were also introduced to the new C128 by Pete Baczor (Commodore's User Group Coordinator) who also provided answers to a variety  of  questions  from  the  floor.  Perhaps  the  most important piece of information we learned was the tollfree  phone  number  for  Customer  Support:  1-800-2479000.
