I'm a little late with this month's issue. But it's probably just as well. The big news for the month just hit yesterday (12/31) and today (1/1). Maybe there's something to that Y2K hype after all. We've got some good news and some bad news. So, let's get to it.

## Amiga Sold - Again!

## Amino Development Buys Amiga

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 31 - Amino Development Corp., a privately held company  based  in Maple  Valley, Washington,  has  purchased  from  Gateway  its  Amiga trademarks  and  Amiga  computer  systems.  Terms  of  the transaction have not been disclosed.

According  to  Peter  Ashkin,  Gateway  senior  vice  president, Gateway chose to sell the name after deciding to fold Amiga's software engineering function into Gateway's product development. This merger of development  activities  is  part  of  Gateway's  overall  strategy  to develop and market the coming generation of 'Internet appliances'.

'Amiga,  as  a  personal  computer  brand,  has  a  loyal following of fans around the world,' Ashkin said. 'Under Gateway's wing, Amiga morphed into a software development company working on a new Internet appliance operating environment software. Now that we're bringing that  development work into Gateway product development, it made sense to find a buyer for Amiga.'

'Yee-haw!'  said  Bill  McEwen,  president  and  CEO  of Amino. 'This is  a  very  exciting  day,  and  now  an  even more exciting tomorrow. Now we can finish the job that was started 15 years ago.'

The  transaction,  effective  immediately,  includes  the transfer  of  all  Internet  domain  names  related  to  Amiga which Gateway had held. Gateway retains ownership of all patents acquired when it bought Amiga in 1997.

## Amiga Web Closes

## CUCUG Retires Amiga Web

January 1, 2000 The    Champaign-Urbana  Computer  Users  Group (CUCUG) (http://www.cucug.org/) announced today that it  has  retired  its  popular,  award-winning  Amiga  Web Directory web site.

Citing continuing declines in the Amiga marketplace and Gateway's  failure  to  deliver  new  Amiga  computer systems, CUCUG reluctantly decided to discontinue its popular  web  site  link  directory  and  news  service  on January  1,  2000.  It  was  felt  that  while  CUCUG  could continue with the AWD for several months, it was better to retire now rather than allow the site to slowly decline with the market. CUCUG is hopeful that the latest owners of  the  Amiga  can  turn  this  market  around  for  the developers and users who have held on throughout all the  past  ownership  changes  and  other  difficulties  the Amiga has faced.

For over five years, the Amiga Web Directory served as one of the most-visited Amiga-oriented web sites on the Internet. Its carefully cataloged listings of Amiga web sites was the most respected collection of its kind. Each site in the  AWD's listings  was  reviewed  by  the  CUCUG  webmaster  to  ensure  quality  and  Amiga  orientation.  Site descriptions were carefully prepared by hand, resulting in accuracy not possible on other machine-driven sites or those which allow site owners to write their own descriptions.

The AWD's Amiga news pages became one of the most imitated features in the Amiga web community. Dozens of Amiga news sites were inspired by the success of the Amiga Web Directory's hugely popular news pages.

A well-known offshoot of the Amiga Web Directory was 'Agnes'  the  Amiga  web  searching  service.  Agnes  was also a cartoon character which personalized the searching service.  In  addition  to  the  over  2000  Amiga  sites cataloged  in  the  Amiga  Web  Directory,  Agnes  could

S

search the general Internet for Amiga content, newsgroup messages, CUCUG Status Register newsletters and other Amiga-oriented materials.

The Amiga Web Directory was one of the first membersupported Amiga web sites. Amiga enthusiasts  joined the CUCUG organization to show their support for the efforts of  the  group.  These  memberships  covered  the  costs associated  with  running  the  popular  web  service  and other CUCUG activities. CUCUG is very grateful to its members' support which it has received over the years. The group also acknowledges the many Amiga-oriented companies which have given assistance.

CUCUG,  which  has  been  supporting  local  computer users in the Champaign-Urbana, Illinois area since 1983, will now focus its efforts on local user group activities.
