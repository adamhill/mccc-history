## D'Amiga is D'Thing

## Developer workstation announced

July 13, 2000 - Amiga Inc., Snoqualmie, WA, today announced  manufacturing  and  distribution  agreements with  Wonder  Computers  International  Inc.  in  Ottawa, Canada and Software Hut, Inc. in West Chester, PA. These agreements  will  allow  the  manufacture  of  d'Amiga Authorized Developer Workstations in North America. Both Software Hut and Wonder Computers are well known and well regarded figures in the Amiga community. Their involvement dates back well over a decade. Amiga, Software Hut and Wonder Computers share the  same  vision  and  strategy  to  establish  the  Next Generation Amiga as the preeminent media platform and operating environment for the future. ``It  gives  us  great  pleasure  to  have  released  the Software  Development  Kit  (SDK)  on  schedule  and  to follow  up  with  such  excellent  value  to  the  community with  the  d'Amiga  Developer  Workstation.  It  gives  us equal pleasure to have the support of Software Hut and Wonder  Computers  behind  this  release.  Through  this developer  machine,  we  achieve  our  goal  of  providing excellent value in superior hardware to realize our cross platform  binary  compatibility  promise  for  developers. This will no doubt come as great news to those in the community seeking value of their dollar as they develop for  the  great  number  of  target  platforms  that  Amiga supports,' said Randall Hughes, Vice President, Sales and Strategic Alliances at Amiga Inc. 'We at Software Hut are extremely excited to have been  selected  as  the  official  US  Distributor  for  the authorized d'Amiga Developer Workstation. Many of our customers and dealer partners have been looking for a machine with all the specifications to run the Amiga SDK in  one  bundled  package.  Our  combined  efforts,  along with Amiga Inc.'s and Wonder Computers', will ensure that all developers will have easy and affordable access to the tools needed to develop software that will revolutionize computing as we now know it,' said Joseph Muoio, President of Software Hut, Inc. 'We are proud to be a part  of  this  quantum  leap forward  in  computing  technology,  and  look  forward  to working  closely  with  Amiga  and  Software  Hut  on  this project in the weeks and months to come. The developer machine is more than just a tool. It represents the first significant opportunity for Amigans and former Amigans everywhere  to  join  forces  and  help  bring  about  a  real change  in  the  way  computers  work.  The  developers machine  can  also  be  configured  to  run  Amiga  Classic software through emulation, adding further to its potential value for anyone considering a purchase,' extolled Mark Habinski, President of Wonder Computers International Inc. The  developer  machine  represents  unparalleled value, uses brand name parts of the highest quality, and is bundled with a comprehensive warranty on hardware and an  enhanced  level  of  support  from  Amiga  Inc.  The workstation also includes the Amiga SDK. 'We at Amiga are proud to have our name on the d'Amiga Authorized Developer Workstation,' said Mr. Hughes, in reference to its  significant  value  and  competitive  price.  Such  a price/performance  achievement  is  not  possible  using clone  hardware.  If  it  does  not  have  the  official  Amiga Boing insignia, it is not an authorized Amiga Developer Workstation. Please see www.amiga.com for full details. The d'AMIGA represents outstanding value to our community in its functionality and support. Feature for feature, it represents the most affordable performance and comprehensive  support  available  on  a  standardized platform to Amigans and other Amiverse developers.
