## Our New Website

## Bigger, better… and a new URL

Many of you have probably noticed by now that your club has a new website. As you may have known, our web space up until now has been generously provided free  of  charge  by  Startext,  run  by  the  Fort  Worth  Star Telegram. About a month ago they informed us that they were  about  to  exit  the  web-space/dial-up  business

Dallas entirely, and so would be unable to continue to provide us  with  the  space  we  had  enjoyed  until  now.  So  I embarked on a quest to find affordable space that would provide us the kind of features that we should probably always have had, but which were unavailable to us with Startext's free service. Anyway, to make a short story even shorter, I found it. The Board of Directors approved the annual expense at the September meeting… and we're off and running.

We're coming very close to providing the same services we provided last year but instead of it costing $36/year per member (for club and BBS membership) as it did in 1999, now it costs just $18/year.

The first change you're likely to notice is that we have our own, new URL. We are now known as AmigaMCCC . The URL is  simply http://www.amigamccc.org .  This  should make it  easier  to  find  -  and  it  means  that  even  if  we move our website, we'll keep the same URL.

As I mentioned, we'll be able to do things now that we couldn't do in the past. The first change will be that I will no longer be removing the downloads at the end of each month.  We  have  plenty  of  space  available,  so  I'll  be leaving  them  out  there…  maybe  not  forever,  but  for  a while, at least. Maybe a year?

The second change that has already been implemented is the addition of a search engine to the web site. This isn't a general purpose web search engine like you'll find on Excite, Yahoo and others (we have no need to compete with them). This is a website search engine. If you'd like to  see  all  the  articles  Johnny  Kitchens  has  written,  just enter  Kitchens  and  the  links  to  his  articles  will  be  displayed.  Or  if  you  want  to  see  everything  about  the Fleamarket,  just  enter  flea.  What  the  engine  does  is search  the  documents  on  the  website  looking  for  the word or words that you enter. Then it displays links to ý

1244 Brookside Drive

Hurst, Texas

))

those documents that you can simply click on. Give it a try - it's pretty neat.

They'll  be  other  changes  as  well.  I  expect  to  add  a message base soon where we can post information and exchange knowledge just like we did with the BBS until we had to shut it down early this year. After that? I'm not sure yet, but keep watching.

All in all, I think this is a pretty exciting addition to the club. This makes up nicely for the loss of the BBS to the Y2K bug… and does it for a lot less money than the BBS was costing… most importantly, at no extra cost to the membership. We're coming very close to providing the same services we provided last year - but instead of it costing $36/year per member (for club and BBS membership)  as  it  did  in  1999,  now  it  costs  just  $18/year.  The bargain just gets better and better.
