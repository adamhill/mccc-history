## Executive Update

## from Bill McEwen October 21, 2000

Dear Amiga Family,

I am writing this as I fly back from a wonderful two days at the ACE 2000 Amiga show in Melbourne, Australia. It was indeed a great delight and pleasure to meet with all the wonderful members of the Amiga Family Down Under, and I already look forward to my next opportunity to visit Australia.

I especially want to thank all the dealers, developers and end users who attended the seminars and the hundreds of you who joined for the banquet dinner. Amiga truly is a global family, and too much of an unknown phenomena. It is the Amiga Family who has kept this amazing system alive and growing.

I would like to take a moment to recognize the efforts of two people who especially made my stay in Australia an enjoyable and educational experience: Jeff Rose, of Unitech, the d'Amiga distributor for Australia, and Basil Flinter, the Secretary of the Amiga Down Under Group or ADUG. I want to thank them both for taking the extra time to help me truly understand what Australia and New Zealand mean to Amiga, and what Amiga can do to help our its Family Down Under. I can certainly say that on my next trip I will take the time to also visit New Zealand and say hello in person.

## Upcoming Products

There are many exciting things happen- ing with Amiga and I wanted to tell the

entire Amiga community what the attendees of ACE 2000 learned at the show.

Amiga will release an upgrade for the Classic AmigaOS! Version 3.9 of the AmigaOS will be shipped and ready for the 2000 holiday season. AmigaOS 3.9 is being developed in concert with Haage and Partner GmbH. A new website devoted specifically to OS3.9 will be online shortly and it will include an OS feature list and other bits of useful information. OS 3.9 will be made available to classic Amiga users for the affordable price of under $40.00 US. Watch our main website, www.amiga.com, for more details of OS 3.9 and its new website.

Because Amiga is still a Benevolent Dictatorship - and not a democracy or even a republic - we listen closely to the feedback and input from the community. Based on this feedback we strive to create products that you want, need and enjoy.

We are pleased to announce to the community the first in a series of new hardware that has been designed by Amiga and soon manufactured by Amiga OEM partners. The first in our AmigaONE series of products are the AmigaONE PPC 1200 and the AmigaONE PPC 4000 cards from Eyetech. These products will become available to developers in December this year and are designed to meet the specific needs of the Amiga Community. We have also announced another partner, bPlan GmbH, who are creating a new AmigaONE PPC based desktop computer.

More details will emerge shortly about bPlan, Eyetech and the new AmigaONE products, so visit the AmigaONE web site at www.amiga.com/products/one/pr.s html to stay informed.

I would also like to announce new versions of the Amiga SDK. AmigaSDK version 1.1 will begin shipping on October 24, 2000. In addition to an upgrade for the Linux version, we are pleased to release the Windows version of the Amiga SDK as well.

There was a mistake in the September 28 Executive Update. As erroneously printed in the update, the Amiga SDK 1.1 does not include the sound, UI, or 3D pieces. These will be found in version 1.2, which itself will be released shortly. I am sorry for the error, but take comfort in the fact that purchasers of an Amiga SDK receive free updates and upgrades for 12 months from the date of purchase.

Closing It has been an amazing 10 months since we started Amiga Incorporated. The community has seen the delivery of the Amiga SDK, an upgrade to ß

oingea!

IcEwen ne rest

a Team the SDK, an upgrade to the Classic AmigaOS, and now the announcement of three PPC based AmigaONE products. We still have a long way to go and many more battles to fight, but I am confident that with the community behind us, and the enhancements to the product line continuing, there is a long and exciting future for Amiga.

To the user group members around the world, it is time to start calling the members who have drifted away and let them know what is happening with the new Amiga. We want them to know they can again be part of continuing the legacy that is Amiga.

Again thanks to Greg and Michael, and the

## Editor's Comments

The Newsletter I don't know what came over me. I woke up on the day it was time to do the newsletter and decided it needed a facelift. Hope you like it…

The Website It turned out that the reason no-one was leaving messages on the new message base is that it wasn't working. Thanks to those who let me know. It's fixed now, and there has been some activity.

The December update will feature info on the AmigaOne computer and the OS 3.9 upgrade.
