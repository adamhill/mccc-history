## Executive Update from Bill McEwen

September 28, 2000

Greetings to one and all.

I know it has been a long time since I last had the chance to write to all to all of you.

It has been very, very busy, and we have seen some great successes,  and  some  disappointments.  I  have  not  been asleep, and to the contrary I have not been getting much sleep of late. There is so much activity, and so little time that I have been spending a great deal of time in other areas and not keeping everyone up to date.

To my Friends in Italy, I apologize that I was not able to attend  the  show.  It  was  a  real  disappointment  for  me personally, as I wanted to greet each and every one of you. The reason was not because we are broke, or out of money as the rumors would state.

Simply,  there  were  two  companies  in  California  that  I have been working with, and they requested a meeting that occurred over the same period of time. With working with these OEM's we will be able to add several million more Amigans, and the discussions  went  well  and  are progressing quickly, these meetings were in addition to what is mentioned in point 3 below.

Now with all the above fun stuff…

Here we go:

## 1. The SDK for Amiga DE.

This has been very exciting, and we are really pleased with  the  number  of  applications  and  the  number developers  using  the  product  to  create  some  great products.

The next version of the Software Development Kit will be out in the next couple of weeks. In addition to the Linux

November 2000

Dallas version  there  is  now  a  version  available  for  Windows. That's correct - you are now able to develop for the new Amiga on either Linux, or Windows.

It will feature a new raft of multimedia (Mesa, the SSEYO Koan Audio Engine, streaming)  as  well  better  development tools, a richer AVE and enhanced performance.

## 2. Amiga OS 3.5 and beyond

We are continuing taking a very hard look at the current Amiga and how we can best move the platform forward. There  are  discussions  on  going  for  some  new  opportunities  and  we  will  be  able  to  share  some  announcements in the very near future.

## 3. Amiga DE business opportunities

Wow, this  is  an  area  that  is  absolutely  exploding.  For developers this is going to be great news. Not only will the  applications  you  are  working  on  be  used  by  your Amiga family members, but with the deals that are either executed  or  in  motion  there  will  be  millions  more consumers joining the Amiga family.

Now many of you began to speculate on the Meternet announcement. Meternet is offering a great product, and they  are  going  to  be  making  it  available  to  the  Amiga community, but it is not the AmigaOne.

## 4. The AmigaOne.

We have listened  to  a  great many  of  you  with  comments, suggestions, business ideas and technical ideas. Dean Brown has been  a  huge  help,  especially that he is now here in Snoqualmie  with  the  other members of the team.

Because of this input we have begun negotiations for a brand new design. Most of the details have been worked out, and I hope to have the finished announcement ready by the middle of October. It is my firm belief that you will all be very pleased and excited.

5. Dealers/Distributors, and our friends in the Press The well of information for all of you has been too dry, and inconsistent. To better provide information to each and  every  one  of  you,  Amiga  has  created  two  new mailing lists. Please go to www.amigadev.com and select mailing lists on the right hand side of the screen. Select either press or dealer, and fill out your information. We will begin weekly feeds to these lists to better support our press and dealers.

I  know  that  many  of  you  will  read  that  this  letter  says nothing, and that there is nothing happening, other than a new motorcycle for me.

Well you are very wrong. We are meeting directly with the heads of some of the largest computer and consumer electronics companies in the world, and not only do they see the value in what we are offering but they see where the Amiga community, you, is the real value. ý

Now we still have a ways to go, but we are moving very fast, and I know that you will all be very proud of Amiga as we continue to make things happen.

The  biggest  challenge  for  Amiga  right  now  is  to  stay focused on our core strengths, and not make the mistakes of those who have walked before us.

The  Amiga  opportunity  is  huge,  and  sometimes  overwhelming. There are so many conflicting reports, and I have not done a very good job of being able to communicate to all of you as well as I would like to.

We are getting much closer every day, and every one of you are a major part of the Amiga Family's success.

## Website News

New in October

The  new  message  base  has  been  active  since  early  in October. So far, I'm the only one who has left a message. Maybe  this  is  a  feature  no-one  is  interested  in  -  or maybe no-one has noticed it. To get to it,  just  use  the button  marked  'Messages.'  I'll  leave  it  up  for  another month to see if there's interest.

There  are  some  pictures  from  the  Amiga  North  Dallas meeting. Use the 'Meetings' button to get there. There are also pictures from the recent Fleamarket. The link on the home page will display the thumbnails.

Coming in November Look for info on the new AmigaOne computer!
