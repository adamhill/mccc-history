## What are those little faces, anyway? to change computing forever, again

Have you seen them? The little faces added to messages to add a little extra feeling to the message you see in your email or on newsgroups messages. Some are easy and get used the most, such as the smiley face, :) , and they are recognized for what they are by most. What about the others? Many times I would see them and just plain not be sure what they meant. So here is a list to help you with the more familiar as well as the less used or understood of the clan.

:) = Smile :-[ = Angry :-O = Surprised :D = Laughing %-) = Confused :-0 = Very surprised :P = Sticking out tongue :-|| = Very angry :-( = Sad O:) = Angel :8) = Piggy :-C = Very sad :( = Frown 8-O = Shocked :-X = Lips Sealed ;) = Wink &lt;:-) =Dunce :-| = Indifferent :X = My lips are sealed :-) = Happy :-@ = Scream :-d = Lick lips :&lt;) = Snobby :'-) = Happy with tear :&gt;) = Nosy ':-) = Raised eyebrow ;-) = Happy with wink B) = Wearing shades 8-) = Glassed :-/ = Skeptical :* = Kiss |-0 = Yawn :~) = Wonder [:] = Robot

Now go out and try your new vocabulary on someone, and see how it changes your way of communicating with others.

Amiga,  the  creators  of  Multi-Media  computing,  have announced the release of their developer kit for Amiga, Linux, and Java developers.

June 3, 2000 - Snoqualmie, WA - Amiga announces the release  of  the  Amiga  Software  Developers  Kit,  the  first new  product  to  introduce  the  next  generation  Amiga platform.

The Amiga Software Developers Kit provides the initial tools  and  examples  for  developers  to  create  exciting multi-media content for multiple devices and computing environments.  The  unique  strength  of  the  New  Amiga comes  from  the  partnership  with  the  Tao  Group  in Reading England providing a foundation where developers  are  able  to  take  advantage  of  a  ubiquitous computing environment.

In 1984 Amiga established what is known today as multimedia. As a result of this, Amiga systems are used around the  world  by  leading  film  studios,  animators,  and  in mission critical applications. Using this as the foundation, the Amiga is moving forward by creating multi-media for numerous devices  and  computing  environments  in  the home, in the office and beyond.

The Amiga OS is capable of being self-hosted, and sitting on top of other operating systems. A single application is capable  of  running  on  X86,  Power  PC,  M.core,  ARM, StrongArm, MIPs, SH3/4, and others. In a hosted environment the new Amiga runs on versions of Linux, Windows 95,98/NT, Windows CE, OS/9, QNX4, and others to be announced.

The new OS also embraces the Java language in a new, powerful and compliant way. The intent Java Technology Edition  from  Tao  is  world  renowned  for  its  speed  and compact  execution  of  Java  applications.  With  the  new environment, developers will be able to take advantage of both Java, and portable assembler coding.

'Today we take the first step towards the future', said Bill McEwen President/CEO of Amiga, Inc.' The new Amiga SDK provides an environment where the best developers in  the  world  can  build  exciting  applications  that  can transcend hardware limitations. Today Amiga developers can  be  joined  by  Linux  and  Java  developers  in  an  environment that provides the foundation for the delivery of future content.'

'Tao  has  been  talking  for  some  time  now  about  our developments  to  create  Digital  Heaven™  and  we  see Amiga and its community as a fundamental part of the new order that can make it happen and take an industry lead. With the sheer tenacity and the many qualities of McEwen and his Amiga team, the world is going to see Amiga as a Premier Brand for connected digital appliances,' said Francis Charig Chairman of the Tao-Group. For the developer, the new SDK creates a single environment that  is  scalable  from  handheld  devices,  such  as  cell
