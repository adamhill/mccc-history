## A new meeting time

If  you  weren't  there  last  month,  you  missed  the discussion…  but  we  talked  about  the  possibility  of changing  the  monthly  meeting  date  to  the  second Monday. Seems that day would be a lot easier on many of our members. Well, it's happened! After checking with a couple of more people, we decided to make the switch. From now on the Amiga By-The-Loop Chapter will be meeting on the second Monday of the month. The place (the  North  Richland  Hills  Community  Center)  and  the time (7:30 pm) remain the same. The change is effective with  this  month's  meeting.  Hope  to  see  you  there… March 13.

## EXECUTIVE UPDATE - February 4, 2000 -----------------------------------Executive Update February 14, 2000

Greetings to one and all: A great  deal  has  occurred  over  the  last  couple  of weeks, and it is only going to get more interesting as we move forward. It has been some time since I spoke with you, and I wanted to share some of the fun. In the last two weeks we have announced our new foundation  partner,  started  technical  training  with  our new  development  team,  and  had  many  meetings  with future technology partners. The responses have been overwhelmingly positive and, to quote an old song 'they ain't seen nothing yet.' On  January  8,  2000  at  CES  in  Las  Vegas  we announced  our  partnership  with  the  Tao-Group  as  our foundation OS partner. This is not just a technical but a strategic relationship and brings with it great rewards. I have asked Fleecy to write a short document highlighting the  Amiga/Tao  relationship  from  a  more  technical perspective, to save you from having to put up with my telling everyone how incredibly great and fantastic it is.

We want you to make your own minds up. In  the  next  two  weeks  we  will  make  another strategic  partnership  announcement with regards to the new path for Amiga. As with all our announcements, look at it against the whole picture and not in isolation. After  a  week  long  trip  to  Germany  and  the  UK  I have  come  back  with  a  much  better  understanding  of what we can and cannot do. As mentioned before we are not going to make promises or product announcements. We will announce to you, the community, only after the deal  is  signed  or  the  product  is  sitting  before  us.  This won't put a stop to rumours, but it will make them all the more  obvious.  Change  brings  uncertainty,  and  in  an information  vacuum,  mischief  makers  like  to  take  the spotlight. If it isn't officially sanctioned by Amiga, don't believe it. Our job as a company is to create exciting market opportunities for Amiga developers to take advantage of, and to give Amiga users a platform they can enjoy. This requires more than just an upgrade to the existing OS. This  requires,  indeed  demands  a  complete  strategy reaching into all areas of the present and the future. The time  has  come  for  all  of  us  to  move  forwards,  owner, developer, and user. Many of you have sent us business proposals, and product marketing ideas, and for this we thank you, and ask  for  your  patience  as  we  look  over  them.  Some  are providing us with valuable insight into the desires of the Amiga community as a whole, others are providing us with a good chuckle. This is the Amiga advantage that other platforms just do not share. Over  the  next  few  months  there  may  be  some companies that come out with their own plans, or state that we do not have the community at heart as we move forwards. The reality is, they do not know what we have planned.  In  order  to  stay  focused  and  to  keep  up  our incredible pace, we are not sharing our plans outside of our signed partnerships. We have to prioritise and act singlemindedly if we are  to  reach  our  first  plateau  in  our  given  timescales. Once there we will be able to pause for breath. Some are not happy about this, but they do not know the full plan. Our mission is not just  about  restoring  the  Amiga,  but about pushing it forwards as THE technology for tomorrow.

This means that if you hear something annoying, or frustrating,  or  downright  nasty,  and  the  source  is  not Amiga Inc, then disregard it.

Plain and simple.

If you did not hear it from us, or read it here on this web site it is not true.

We are not asking  for  your  trust  or  your  undying belief. We only ask that you take us on OUR words and deeds, not on the misinterpretations of others.

We will soon be starting official meetings in Europe, the UK, and the US for developers and dealers. This will include introductory training seminars for the new OS, and introductions to the retail pricing and schedules. We will also begin the process of introducing the new web site, and putting the Amiga Advisory Council to work.

I want to thank each and every one of you for your hospitality  during  our  meetings  and  for  your  continued support as we move forwards. We have had the chance to meet with many end users, developers, dealers, and new
