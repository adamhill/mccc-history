## The New Amiga Vision

## Imagine…

At the banquet at Amiga 2K, we saw a demonstration of the Tao operating system running on top of a Linux box. We watched as Fleecy Moss first popped up one window after another which held various small applications, and the machine responded with out a moment's hesitation. But, then the real awe inspiring demo commenced. He opened three windows, two of which had instantiations of Quake running, and the third of which held an instantiation  of  Doom.  All  three  games  ran  flawlessly.  It  was very impressive.

But, what made it really impressive was what was being demonstrated.  As  Fleecy  ran  the  demo,  Bill  McEwen made  the  point  from  the  podium  that  there  was  no hardware  acceleration  on  this  machine.  It  had  a  nice processor - a 500 MHz Pentium III - but no graphics card. Everything that we were seeing was going through the main processor.

But,  there  was  more  here  than  that.  The  machine  was running a Linux OS, but it had an abstraction layer on top of it. The abstraction layer masks the Linux OS, such that the applications which were running are not specifically targeted  for  Linux,  but  are  instead  targeted  for  this abstraction layer. That is, these applications are written for a  different  OS  -  and  that  OS  is  what  will  become  the Amiga OS.

This  is  really  just  an  extension  of  Sun's  Java  concept. Indeed, Tao's operating system really is based upon a Java Virtual Machine. Sun's slogan for Java is 'write once, run anywhere.' The whole point of writing a program in Java is that you will be able to turn around and run that same program, without porting or even a new compile, on any machine.

Which is an exciting theory. But, everyone knows what's wrong with Java.

It's slow.

But it isn't anymore.

The thing that made this a slack-jaw demonstration for anyone who understood what they were seeing - the thing  that  made  some  of  us  wonder  if  what  we  were seeing was even real - is that it was running at mind blurring speed, flawlessly, through an abstraction layer.

To understand the point, imagine that you are a games developer.  You  write  the  latest,  hottest,  3D  fantasy masterpiece, and you want to sell it to as many people as possible. In today's world, that means that you pick one of  many  competing  game  platforms  -  Play  Station, Nintendo, PC, Mac, Amiga, etc. for which to write your game. You make your choice based upon which market you think you can sell the most games into. You write the game for that machine, getting all of the bugs out of the code, and putting together your story and graphics. Then, if the first release is a success, you might port the game to a  different  platform.  But,  this  could  take  another  six months to a year, and keeps you from working on the sequel,  or  on  another  brilliant  idea.  And,  if  your  first release does not sell, you probably won't bother with a port at all. So, if you picked wrong, a game that may have been a success on another platform could flop on the one you  picked.  Plus,  to  get  to  the  widest  possible  market requires a lot of work, as you do two or three ports.

Now,  here's  how  Amiga  is  proposing  to  change  that. Imagine that you write the game for the new Amiga. In every  conceivable  environment  -  PC,  Mac,  game console, or even server - there exists an Amiga abstraction layer. So, your game will run on every machine out there, as long as the end user has the Amiga abstraction layer. So, on the day you release the game for the Amiga, you also release it for the PC, the Mac, the Play Station, the Nintendo - in principal, even for workstations and servers.  The  basic  Amiga  release  assumes  that  the  end user already has the Amiga abstraction layer running on his machine. But, it wouldn't be that hard to make a 'PC bundle' that included the game and the Amiga abstraction layer for the PC (which you would charge more for, and pay a license to Amiga for).

I use games as an example for several reasons. One is that there  are  several  clearly  visible  competing  games  platforms out there, and this makes the advantages very clear. A second is that there are a lot of games released every year, and there is a lot of financial incentive for this type of  approach.  The  third  is  that  games  really  do  tend  to push the hardware and software performance of a system. If  you can do this for games, which Amiga has demonstrated that you can (three copies of Doom, and one of Quake on a system without 3D graphics acceleration), then you can do if for anything.

And that's  the  other  point.  You  can  do  it  for  anything. Write  a  really  cool  paint  program  once,  and  sell  it  to everyone in the graphics arts community, no matter what machine they are on. Write a good word processor, and sell it to everyone. Write a powerful financial package or database,  and  your  end  customer  can  run  it  on  every machine in his office, from the PC to the mainframe.

During  the  UGN  meeting,  McEwen  was  asked  if  we should be careful about keeping these plans within the community, which we had heard from someone else who recently stood at the helm of Amiga. The real question was do we have to worry about Microsoft.

His  response  was  'I'm  not  worried  about  Microsoft. Microsoft represents no competition to us. We will have one OS that can run on everything from a cell phone to a server. No one else has that.'

One OS from a cell phone to a server. Write your application  once,  and  run  it  on  every  box  and  information appliance made. That is the new Amiga vision, and it is a powerful vision indeed.

## New AGM Dues

At the last MCCC Board of Dirctors meeting, the Board voted to change the club dues. Beginning immediately, club dues will be reduced to $18 a year, or $10 for a six month membership. The reduction applies to all new or renewing memberships. The change will have no affect on existing memberships.

The Board is pleased to be able to offer this reduction at this time. This is the first dues reduction in the history of the club. The $18 annual membership returns us to the same  dues  structure  that  existed  when  the  club  was founded more than seventeen years ago.

Don't you wish everything was the same price as it was 17 years ago?
