## The Evolution of the PC

I've talked at length every now and  again  about  how  the computer world has changed over the few decades since its inception as a consumer-grade thing. In the early days-the EARLY early days, a home computer wasn't much more than a technophile's toy. It was this box hooked to a screen that  one  used  to  show  off whatever programming prowess they'd  learned  to  anyone  who might appreciate it. It had fairly little impact on real life unless someone was resourceful enough to write a program that applied the computer's strengths to reallife issues. Fortunately, over time a lot of people did, which led to an era where people and companies started putting computers to work.

The 'big three' pieces of business software, the word processor, the spreadsheet,  and  the  database, made  using  computers  very advantageous to businesses, since suddenly accountants didn't have to do an hour of math every time some number in a payroll column was  changed.  From  then  on, home computers were a means for workers to 'take their work home,' which was usually a rationale to buy the same kind of system they had at the office, cementing an early hold by the IBM-PC and compatibles (later known as the Windows boxes) on the market.

Kids wanted computers too, and parents believed (or rationalized) that  it  was  an  important educational tool, while the kids were mostly in it for the games that were beating the Ataris and Intellivision game systems of the time. Still, the average person of the  time  had  to  know  some programming, or at least a few DOS commands,  to  get  their favorite game running. That too would  change,  with  the  next generation  of  hardware  and operating systems. I guess we can blame Steve Jobs and Apple for popularizing  the  mouse  and graphic user interface, followed by all the others, along with the idea that computers should be easy to use. Exactly how easy they were is up for debate, but they were more accessible  to  someone  who preferred not to memorize a lot of text commands to get from here to there.

Sort  of  like  having  a  car  or  a television, owning a computer was one of those things that was not a life necessity, but it seemed weird if  you  DIDN'T  have  one, followed  shortly  after  by  the yardstick of being connected to the Internet. Computers and the Internet moved quickly from the territory of the savvy (those who needed it for their career or those just attracted to the tech) to damn near everyone, and the market went along as a result. We might stand on the precipice of a new era  coming  soon,  as  the proliferation  of  Internet- connected 'smartphones' and items like Apple's iPad look set to usher in some vision out of Star Trek, where people pass around those informational PADDs like they  did  with  papers  and clipboards years ago.

As sort of an observer on the developing scene, I've come to the general conclusion that in the current computer climate, we are left with two primary uses for machines; the secondary, 'doing stuff,' and the primary, 'messing around.' 'Doing stuff' is a lot like  'work'  from  years  ago, though it doesn't necessarily have to  be  job-related.  It  involves doing things like serious work or creative efforts. It also usually involves  some  sort  of productivity software which has to be purchased (or pirated if you're amoral about it). On the other side, 'messing around' is the thing most people do with their computers on a regular basis which use up time and can be entertaining or even enriching, but offer little beyond that. These are  the  activities  like  playing games, puttering around with the various facets of the Internet, and organizing ones' photos, music, videos, and other media. Basically, it's the stuff that can be done with any Mac running a copy of iLife (except maybe the games). It's the computer equivalent of doing  the  daily  crossword  or sudoku puzzles in the paper, or redecorating  your  homesomething to do and enjoy, but

determined how far things like the marked  by  those  devices  that refuse  to  call  themselves computers: the iPhone, iPad, and other  iGear.  There's  also  the netbook, a scaled-down laptop computer geared strongly toward a  'messing  around'  priority. Where the netbooks took a 'real' computer and scaled it down, items  like  the  iPad  took  the interface  formerly  designed primarily  for  PDAs  and smartphones and scaled it up. The  mouse/keyboard/GUl interface and the touch-screen

There's nothing wrong with 'messing around,' as everyone needs at least some diversion and play in  their  lives  to  keeps themselves from going either insane or freakishly dull, but it seems like that's the only thing some  ever  do  with  the astounding technology at their disposal. I wonder what the early semiconductor engineers and operating system programmers might  think  about  the revelation that the evolution of those technologies they helped create would be used to exchange 128-character snippets of inane text with 'followers,' or search out free porn.

I mentioned the possibility of a new paradigm of computer usage,

interfaces  each  have  their advantages.  While  it's  not  yet determined how far things like the iPad can go, it seems like the old interface may remain advantageous for more complex productivity applications. Perhaps in a few years the  touchscreen  devices  will become the preferred 'messing around'  method,  leaving  the 'doing stuff' to the full computers, creating a true schism between different  types  of  users  and applications,  at  least  until  the brain-implant computers come a decade later. I'm pretty sure the Amigas will be in there somewhere.
