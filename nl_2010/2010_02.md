## AmigaOne X1000

'What is X'? The answer is that X is many things. X is the Xena/XMOS chip,  and  the  Xorro  slot  that accompanies it. X is the mystery CPU, and above all, X is the AmigaOne X1000, the new complete desktop computer system from A-EON.

It's  almost  25  years  since Commodore  released  the  A1000 model that launched the line in the summer of 1985, and with the launch of the X1000 we will usher in a new beginning for the AmigaOS platform. Just as Commodore did with the A1000, we're aiming at the high-end first,  with  a  powerful  desktop computer aimed at the professional and  serious  hobbyist  markets (although you won't have to wait until summer, and it should be a little cheaper!) The launch of the A1000 offered  something  new,  and  the X1000 will do the same. The world has moved on and custom chips no longer make much sense, but the X1000 offers a customizable chip as standard instead - "Xena."

Thanks  to  Xena  and  the  Xorro interface,  the  X1000  offers extraordinary flexibility. We believe that with this easy gateway to the world of 'Software Defined Silicon' and a path to massive parallelism, the X1000  will  once  more  make  the AmigaOS platform the best choice for  truly  creative  and  unique applications. For custom hardware control from robotics to theatrical lighting, for hobbyist creativity, for hardware hacking and for a multitude of  applications  we  haven't  even imagined yet, the X1000 is a dream platform - and therein lies another meaning of 'X': the unknown. It is you,  not  us,  who  will  define  the future.

Of course that's far from all there is to the X1000. Even if you have no interest in the co-processor concept, the X1000 is by a large margin the most  powerful  and  up-to-date platform for running AmigaOS. With a fast dual-core CPU and a full range of modern interfaces such as PCIe x16, SATA and USB 2.0, the already extremely responsive AmigaOS will at last have a truly high-end platform to  run  on.  While  AmigaOS  has progressed massively over the last few years (and continues to develop more  and  more  features  at  an impressive rate), the hardware to run it on has not kept pace. There was a time when we had great hardware as well as a great Operating System, and with the AmigaOne X1000, we can finally say that time is come again. While the entry level is currently well catered  for  by  ACube's  SAM motherboard,  it  is  this  return  of AmigaOS to the high-end that truly ushers in a new beginning.

The Nemo designers had a brilliant idea: 'Why not add an XMOS chip'? Once, there were custom chips; for the AmigaOne X generation, we have customizable chips. XMOS calls it 'Software Defined Silicon." We call it 'Xena,' a nod to the old custom chip names.  It's  the  inheritor  of  the 'transputer'  concept,  and  it's something we're quite excited about.

Capable of eight concurrent real-time threads with shared memory space, at up to 400 MIPS (about 6 68060s worth), Xena gives the X1000 a very flexible,  very  expandable  coprocessor.  The  uses  are  endless: control hardware, DSP functions, robotics, display - even SID chip and console emulators. The Amiga has seen some truly ingenious hacks and add-ons. Xena can take this to a whole new level. It will take a while for the full possibilities to be realized, but we urge you to visit XMOS and discover more for yourselves.

To accompany 'Xena,' we have 'Xorro,' a new slot using an industrystandard PCIe x8 form factor to give access to the 'Xena' IO. This will be the route to Xena's 64 IO lines, which are dynamically configurable as input, output, or bidirectional. 'Xorro' will allow bridging Xena to external  hardware  for  control purposes, to internal systems, or to other Xcore processors. This last point is worth more exploration: XCore  is  a  parallel  processing architecture, and if you want more power, you can simply chain more XCores together. Reference boards have been made with up to 256 cores, offering a theoretical 102400 MIPS. Those of you interested in high-end  imaging  or  scientific applications, for example, take note.

Alas, some mysteries must remain. We are under strict instructions from the 'highers-up' not to reveal the CPU yet.  For  this,  we  can  only apologize, and give you those details that we can reveal at this moment in time.

The AmigaOne X generation will come  with  a  variety  of  CPUs, conforming to the Power ISA 2.04 and newer standards. The X1000 processor currently has very limited availability,  and  you've  probably never seen one in the wild, so don't worry too much about it. For now, please be content with knowing that it's a dual-core Power Architecture™ CPU, with a very low Thermal Design Point. For reference, our designers have  been  running  the  cores  at 1.6GHz during thermal testing, but this  isn't  the  exact  nominal  clock speed.

## Thoughts on the X1000

Well, as we jump into an all new year, the  world  of  the  Amiga  and  its relatives continues to lurch forward in new  and  interesting  ways.  In  the closing months of last year, the long dispute  between  Amiga  Inc.  (or whatever they call themselves now, if anything) and OS-maker Hyperion was  concluded,  with  Hyperion effectively the winner, and the new 'Amiga'  company  for  all  practical purposes. Meanwhile, the MorphOS team released their first version of the operating system to run on Mac (Mini G4) hardware, with further models to follow. While neither of these things are ground-shaking, they both offer steps  forward,  either  directly  or potentially, over and above the relative stagnation  that  has  prevailed  for several years.

Shortly  after  the  new  year,  an announcement was made by Hyperion and a hardware producer calling itself A-EON. Their announcement was called the 'AmigaOne X1000,' a new Amiga system with title a tribute to the original Amiga A1000 model. The specifications for this system are a little vague of this writing, but a few notables include some form of dual core CPU, the usual set of common computer interfaces (SATA, PCI-e, USB 2) along with a new 'Xorro' interface, and a customizable 'Xena' chip.  Exactly  how  this  all  comes together is anyone's guess at this point, as an announcement with nothing concrete  to  show  constitutes vaporware.  Still,  there's  some interesting potential. The customizable Xena chip would seem likely to be some kind of FPGA chip, as seen in the  Minimig and similar hardware, which may give the X1000 a capacity for Amiga legacy compatibility not seen  before,  as  it  may  be  able  to recreate the classic hardware with its own - or non-Amiga hardware as well.  A  lot  of  applications  for software-modifiable  hardware  are possible, given the imagination and ingenuity to use it.

more demanding uses. While this Xl000 is not bleeding-edge tech by any stretch, it at least looks like a step or three forward, instead of sideways or backward. It's apparent a future version of Amiga OS will run on this, perhaps Linux too, as that's the usual way of things. Not surprisingly, there have  already  been  inquiries  on whether the MorphOS team will port their OS to the new X1000 machine. The  response  was  that  they  were concentrating  on  expanding  their coverage  of  PPC  Mac  hardware. They've already been criticized for that answer, but the truth is they can't write or port software for something which doesn't yet exist aside from a set of in-specific specifications, or even make a well-informed decision on  whether  they  want  to  or  not. While it's certainly nice to have a wide variety  of  OS  choices  on  a  wide variety  of  hardware,  it's  not  a requirement to have everything on everything else as long as you can find an option that works best for you.

The main issue as I see it is not so much the exact hardware specs as the idea that this is would be the first new serious hardware since the early Amiga One and Pegasos systems which used the PPC G3/G4 processors. There were later new systems supported by AmigaOS and MorphOS, such as the Efika and SAM44O, but these were limited 'embedded' systems which didn't compare well with their own predecessors, and were ill-suited to

I wish Hyperion and A-EON the best of luck in their endeavors, and I will be watching their progress with great interest, even if I might be more likely to upgrade to a MorphOS-loaded MAC for the time being. Actually I'm doing neither until I'm ready, and the right combination of hardware and software is ready for me to buy.
