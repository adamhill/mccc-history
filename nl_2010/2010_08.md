## Broadband Speed Upgrade

July 21, 2010

Up to 24 million Americans lack access  to  broadband,  the  Federal Communications  Commission announced Tuesday.

Between 14 and 24 million people in the country lack access to high-speed Internet, and immediate prospects for them accessing this service is bleak, the  commission  said  in  its  sixth annual report to Congress about the state of deployment. The 14 million tally  would  about  equal  the  2005 estimated populations of New York City,  Los  Angeles,  and  Chicago combined.

The FCC said the results underscore the need for reform to the Universal Service Fund, innovative approaches to spectrum allocation, the removal of  barriers  to  infrastructure investment, and better broadband data collection.

None of these suggestions are really new, of course. The need for more spectrum has been a hot topic for ages, and efforts on better broadband data collection are already under way.

The report did, however, update its definition  of  what  constitutes broadband service. For over a decade, the  standard  has  been  set  at  200 Kbps downstream, but the FCC now puts it at 4 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream.

'This is a minimum speed generally required for using today's video-rich broadband applications and services, while retaining sufficient capacity for basic web browsing and e-mail,' the FCC said.

The report also outlines states that would qualify as being 'unserved' by broadband.  The  data  used  to calculate this, however, is based on Census Tract information, as well as ISP subscriber information, so the FCC  cautioned  that  it  is  not  as complete as possible. More detailed broadband data information is in the process of being collected.

Tuesday's study, however, identified 39 states  that  have  areas  without broadband access. States not on that list  are  mostly  in  the  Northeast, including New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,  Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maryland, and Rhode Island.

## Finland's Universal Broadband

Last week Finland became the first country  in  the  world  to  declare broadband access a legal right for its citizens. Internet service providers in the country are now obligated to connect every home to connections that can run a minimum of 1 Mbps. Over  the  next  five  years,  the government has vowed to increase the connection speed to 100 Mbps.

96% of the population is already online  in  Finland  and  officials believe that there are only 4,000 homes  that  still  need  to  be connected.  The  nation  has  also stated  that  its  approach  to  file sharing will be less harsh than many of its European neighbors. Internet service providers will send letters to illegal file sharers, but they will not adopt policies that would cut off service  entirely  like  the  UK  and France have suggested they may implement.

## Public  DNS Providers

Services such as OpenDNS, and Google's Public DNS have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their  claims  to  speed  up  web browsing simply by changing the DNS servers your computer uses to resolve  domain  names  into  IP addresses. The basic idea behind the services is that many ISP's do not invest heavily in their own DNS infrastructure, which can result in slow response times, particularly at busy times of day. By creating a network of servers specifically to serve  high  levels  of  DNS  traffic, these companies hope to improve the experience for end users, but is this the reality?

Firstly, we should examine the fact that while your ISP will host its DNS resolvers  within  its  network,  to which your modem has a connection, 3rd-party services such as OpenDNS

and Google's offering are not directly connected. This means your query has to travel further to reach the server which will perform the resolution on your  behalf,  and  on  the  Internet, longer distance = longer response time. There may be some ISPs around the world where their internal network is so complex or badly designed that the round trip between your computer and the DNS resolvers at your ISP takes longer than a round trip to those provided  by  a  3rd-party,  but companies these days are generally more competent, so this is unlikely.

So, how does the DNS response time affect actual browsing speed? The answer is very little. When you first visit a website, your computer will make  a  query  to  discover  the  IP address of the server hosting that site, and upon receiving the response, will store the IP address information in a local  cache,  meaning  that  future requests  for  that  website  will  not generate a further DNS query. This data  is  held  in  the  cache  until  an amount of time specified in the DNS reply has expired (called a time-to-live). So whilst using a faster DNS server may speed up your first load of a webpage, it will not affect the time it takes to load the next page on that website, so in real terms, the saving is minimal,  in  the  order  of  a  few milliseconds.

What then, are the pitfalls? With the growth of user-generated content, and the expansion of software-as-a-service, many companies are looking to CDNs (Content  Delivery  Networks)  to deliver their content to the users. The principle of a CDN is that there are a number of widely distributed nodes located  around  the  world,  with identical copies of the content the site owner wishes to serve. When a user requests a specific piece of content, it is delivered by the CDN node that is closest to them. This results in far improved  speeds,  and  thus  better experience for the user, and can also help to reduce bandwidth bills for the site owners.

Where does DNS fit into this? DNS is the mechanism by which most CDNs will direct your request to the nearest node for content delivery. When you request content stored on a CDN, your browser must first resolve the IP address  of  the  server  hosting  the content. To do this, it sends out a DNS  query  to  the  DNS  servers configured on your computer, these then  pass  the  query  on  to  the nameservers that actually host the domain. The nameservers perform a check to see which of the CDN nodes is closest to the server making the request, and return the IP address corresponding to that server.

The issue here is that while your ISP's DNS servers are generally located near to you, or at least, would take a similar path across the Internet from your ISP's  network,  to  the  website's nameservers, 3rd-party DNS servers will not be. This can result in receiving the IP address of a CDN node which is not optimal for your location, but rather, optimal for the location of the 3rd-party  DNS servers.  While  the

A DNS query  is  a  matter  of  a  few kilobytes, and transfers quickly, but content served via CDN nodes is often images or videos, which are much larger, and a slower connection here will be far more noticeable.

Many of these DNS providers have a good  presence  in  the  US,  but OpenDNS's Network Map shows that it is lacking in servers outside of this region. This means that while a number of CDN owners operate nodes in Asia, users from that region who make use of the OpenDNS service would be directed instead to US based nodes, which they would access over the much slower pacific links.

OpenDNS  offers  a  number  of features on top of just performing DNS resolution, including content filtering  and  phishing  protection, which may be useful to some, but if your primary reason for using a 3rd party DNS service is to speed up your web browsing, it may be worth giving it a second thought. Especially if you frequent websites which make heavy use of CDNs such as Facebook and Youtube.
