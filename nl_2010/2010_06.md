## Changing Paradigms

It's been a busy month so far, even though it's not even half over as of this writing. There's the Easter weekend and the income tax season. Luckily I got my income tax work mostly out of the way in March, save for a few loose ends  (in  this  case  mailing  out  the paperwork related to my tele-filed state taxes). l am, however, still in progress on  helping  out  my  father  with  his income taxes. I'm hoping he knows something I don't, as the early drafts of the  tax  forms  look  to  have  an expensive result. On a related note, there won't be a President's column this week, so I hope you all can survive without.

There  has  even  been  some  Amigarelated news this month. A fair amount of press (Amiga press, anyway) has been thrown around announcing the Amiga  25 th   Anniversary  Vintage Computer Festival happening in the UK. That's right, this year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the release of the original Amiga 1000, in all its 256K, keyboard garage glory. Makes you feel (more) old, doesn't it? A few things  slated  to  show  at  this  UK gathering  include  the  AmigaOne X1000  and  Timberwolf  (the  most recent incarnation of a Mozilla/Firefox Amiga  porting  project)  with  more things possibly to be announced later. Sounds like an interesting time, even if it's overseas. Finally, on the outskirts of the Amiga subject, the Research in Motion corporation, better known as the  people  behind  the  Blackberry smartphone, recently bought out QNX. For those who don't remember, QNX were partnered with Amiga Inc. For some time, providing the OS software base  for  their  'Amiga  Anywhere'

projects, vaunted (mostly by Amiga Inc., not much by anyone else) to be the  second  coming,  scaling  from phones and mobile devices to desktop computers with a hypothetical 'Amiga OS5.' The story mentioned the QNX software being applied to embedded applications, such as computers in cars and the like, though the combo of Blackberry and QNX seems to hold more promise than that of QNX and Amiga Inc.

As usual, I've been thinking and musing about various computer-related stuff. I've written in the past about the march of  technology  toward  smaller  and smaller devices that are more and more powerful, though I recently find myself more fascinated with how consumers can  either  follow  the  flow  or  do something  less  expected.  Home computers started with the desktop boxes, and then the laptops came along. Laptops  were  not  as  powerful  as desktop machines, but were portable and let people get some work done on the road, at least the basic necessary stuff. Nowadays the gulf between the laptops and the desktops is not so obvious.  Desktops  are  still  more powerful, cheaper, or both compared to similar laptops, if only because they don't need to fit all hardware inside a slim portable case, but the average laptop is powerful enough for almost anyone  who  isn't  a  bleeding-edge gamer  or  in  some  other  field  that requires more gigabytes or gigahertz than most, to the point where it's not uncommon for people to have one or more laptops as their primary home systems, with no desktop boxes in sight. Still, as great and portable as laptops are,  there  was  a  need  for  smaller computing devices, and the 'palmtop' computers,  'PDAs',  and  related devices were born. Like the laptops in their  infancy,  these  handheld computing devices were less powerful, geared toward simpler but necessary applications,  like  note-taking  and address  books.  Unlike  the  laptops, they had a wide variety of interfaces and input methods, dictated in part by their  smaller  size,  where  the conventional keyboard and mouse don't work so well. Palmtop/PDA methods  ranged  from  short-form versions of larger computers to touch screens  and  pen-based  interfaces pioneered by devices like the Apple Newton and popularized by the palm pilot and its descendants.

Like  the  laptops  before  them,  the handheld  devices  are  much  more powerful  and  capable,  and  very different from the organizers of old. Most  notably,  they  merged  with another ubiquitous handheld device, the cellphone, creating the Internetconnected 'smartphone,' as well as handling  the  functions  of  other portable electronics, such as music players  or  handheld  games.  It's possible to do as much if not more than a laptop could not that many years ago, all in the palm of your hand. They haven't quite supplanted laptops in the same way laptops pushed aside desktops,  though  they  have  taken much of the niche laptops had in their earlier days. There is one more niche though, recently discovered - that of the 'somewhere in-between.' This is, at least for now, the domain of the 'netbook,' a smaller low-end laptop primarily  for  Internet  surfing  and (relatively) low-demand applications. One-might think, being neither laptop nor palmtop, and not really that much less expensive than some laptops, that they wouldn't be that popular, and yet they  are,  in  part  for  being  more portable than the average laptop, yet offering the size and real estate to operate  standard  apps  more comfortably than on a 3-inch palmsized screen. This line is currently in the infancy the others went through, so who knows exactly  what  the  future result will be. A first possible evolution is on the way in the form of Apple's iPad, which is half upsized iPhone/iPod touch  and  half  Apple's  play  at  the electronic book reader and netbook markets. Still, it brings the iPhone touch interface and applications to a greater amount of screen real estate, making a wider variety of 'standard' computer applications possible, or at least easier, applied to the new interface. It could become a whole new paradigm and change the whole computing world, or just be a detour along the way to the future. I guess we'll find out based on how smug Steve Jobs looks in the future.

## Adventures with AROS

Yes, it has been a long time since I've written anything for the newsletter. One of  the  bad  side  effects  of  a  down economy is the increased workload of those left doing the work. Time that I used to have investigating the intricacies of computers is now spent on much less rewarding pursuits (job). Besides, the world  I  used  to  know,  desktop computers, is going the way of fossil fuels and heading toward a hand-held, mobile future. All that is fine I guess and I am participating in it somewhat, but it still lacks that satisfying control I have at the desk. I have an iPod Touch and as much as I enjoy Apple kicking Microsoft's ass in the mobile arena, I

can't help but feel Jobs is shooting for the 'Next Great Satan,' at least until he drops  dead.  I'll  give  him  credit  for ushering  in  possibly  the  next  great paradigm shift in computing, the iPad, but  the  jury  is  still  out  on  that  one. Bonus points for shifting discussion away  from  telephones  (boring)  and iPods  (ditto)  that  dominate  the otherwise interesting Apple podcasts. Therefore, I will declare that what is left of the desktop is now in the domain of Amiga.

Whenever I look for something to demo at the meeting, I check in to see the state of affairs for AROS. AROS used to be an operating system that I could rely on to boot on the most modest of PC hardware. I enjoyed the fact that a useless PC in the Microsoft world got a new  lease  on  life  in  AROS's. Unfortunately, they changed something in  the  code  and  I  found  increased difficulty  to  even  get  a  machine  up. There are postings stating DMA is at fault and can be disabled at boot up, but many machines I tried just failed and I set  aside  AROS  for  a  year  to  let  it mature a bit more. Recently, a friend of mine gave me a decent spec laptop with a 2.66 MHz P4 and 1.25 Gigs of ram and I thought I'd visit AROS again before I put some version of Linux back on it.

At the meeting I brought in the laptop and the latest version of AROS. Based on  my  previous  experience  with installing  AROS,  I  went  straight  to HDtoolbox and used it to partition and format my drive to Amiga filesystem. It is hardly an intuitive experience and printed instructions by your side are necessary. I managed to fumble my way

## June Calendar

June 7 - MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approximately 9:15 PM - Location TBD

June 26 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 AM

MCCC      4418 Sharpsburg Drive      Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org through the process and ended up with a  drive  with  Amiga  filesystem  and bootable bits set. I did the suggested reboot and went about installing the OS.

After the reboot, I clicked the 'Install OS' button and it became obvious that the previous HDtoolbox work was all for naught. I had very few options and decided to go with the default 'use the whole drive' and 'Smart Filesystem (SFS).' I was taken back a bit with the SFS  Filesystem  bit  at  first  but  was happy with ability to use the higher performance filesystem option. I was even happier with the amazing speed that  the  SFS  formatted.  I  recall spending hours formatting drives with the old FFS. I don't miss that a bit. With the drive formatted, time to install the system. That went surprising well and was quite fast within the posted time of about 20 minutes. The only part that  threw  me  off  was  that  I  also checked off the 'install development tools' option that was not calculated in the install times and added another 15 minutes. Fortunately, the whole process was  completed  right  before  the computer  meeting  ended.  To  my amazement, the machine booted right up without any issues at all. The part that irritates me is that I could not get the  laptop  to  boot  into  its  native resolution  and  was  limited  to  the default VESA 640x480 screen in 16 bits. I messed around with a lot of boot settings and those resulted in a black screen. I'll dig through AROS docs and see if anything will work.
