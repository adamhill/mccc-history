## The X1000 on Display

June 21, 2010

There was only one place to be for Amiga enthusiasts this weekend: a tent at Bletchley Park. Saturday saw the unveiling of the first dedicated Amiga box for some time, in the shape an unusual  and  technically  advanced system  that  maintains  the  Amiga's bleeding edge reputation.

The AmigaOne X1000 is a custom dual core PowerPC board with plenty of modern ports and I/O interfaces. It runs AmigaOS 4, and is supported by Hyperion, a partner in the project. The most interesting bit, though, is the use of an 500Mhz XCore co-processor, which  the  X1000's  hardware designer describes as a descendant of the transputer -once the great hope of British silicon.

said the team hadn't set a price for the box, but suggested it would be 'North of  £1,500',  hopefully  allowing  the company  to  make  something  to reinvest.  The  X1000  should  future proof the AmigaOS for some time.

The event took place at Britain's first Vintage  Computer  Fair  (report  to follow)  in  a  tent  sponsored  by  the Amiga enthusiast groups. These seem to be as busy as ever: the AmigaOS looks terrific, and ports of FireFox and OpenOffice are close to bearing fruit.

The box also houses an ATI Radeon R700 graphics card, 10 USB ports, four PCIe and two PCI slots, besides much else.

The  XCore  allows  fine-grained parallel  processing  and  the equivalent of 256 loosely coupled cores.  At  least  eight  threads  are available at any one time.

The Amiga brought multitasking to personal computing, and when it first appeared in 1985 it made the rest of the market, including Apple's much vaunted Macintosh, look like overpriced toys. Commodore made its  last  Amiga  in  1994.  Various companies have rolled out PPC boards compatible with AmigaOS, since the last update in 2006, but this is the first new box for some time.

## Amiga News

Anymore there's not a lot of news in the Amiga community at any given time, so when something actually does happen, it tends to stand out more. Even better, there's something going on for both sides of the PowerPC fence, Amiga OS4 and MorphOS.

On the OS4 side comes the early alpha release of Timberwolf, a first of the Mozilla  Firefox  Amiga  porting projects to actually bear some fruit. I'm  not  an  OS4  user  (at  least  not currently), but I recognize the value of bringing Firefox to the Amiga. At an earlier time, I would have wanted to see this more than anything else, but with  the  proliferation  of  newer Webkit-based web browsers such as OWB, it's not quite the priority it once was. I can see one especially good reason for Timberwolf or other Amiga Firefox ports, and that's if they can support the wide range of plugins Firefox on other platforms uses. I don't know much about Timberwolf yet, so I can't say either way if it will. It would  be  a  strong  'selling  point' though, especially if the port reaches a wider range of Amiga-related systems. 68K-based Amigas might be a bit much to ask for, but adding MorphOS and AROS would be welcome.

On the MorphOS side of the fence comes a new update to the operating system itself, version 2.5. Another PPC Mac model has been added to the short  list  supported  by  Morph. Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately, depending on your point of view) the only new added model so far is the EMac, particulary the 1.25 Ghz model. (Other  EMac  models  are  not  yet tested, but may work as well.) I've been waiting for support of one or more Mac laptop models myself, for

).

portability, and others are waiting on the promised Powermac G4 tower models, but the EMac (notable for being rather inexpensive on the secondary market, as well as being the last Mac model with an integrated CRT monitor) is it for the time being. Hopefully more Mac model support is coming sooner rather than later. Like many MorphOS 2.x updates, it's more a matter of tweaks and bug fixes than added features. The OWB web browser is included, now at version 1.8. This version of OWB adds HTML5 video support, which makes Youtube and similar sites accessible (though you will have to change settings on the site from using flash to HTML5). Along with  the  previously  mentioned Timberwolf, it represents another step toward  making  web  browsing  as functional on Amiga and Amiga-like systems as it is on any other. Let's all hope that it only gets better from here.

Oh yeah, I hear that lPhone and lPad are pretty popular too.

## Vintage Computer Festival

Announcing  the  upcoming Vintage  Computer  Festival South 1.0

Saturday and Sunday, August 7-8, 2010, Nedderman Hall, University of Texas Arlington

Sponsored by: the Museum of Information Technology at Arlington and the University of Texas Arlington College of Engineering

We are in the early planning stages. Right now we need to find volunteers for the following very important positions. If you would like to be responsible for one of these areas, please contact Gil Carrick at gilcarrick@gmail.com.

Exhibit Manager Speaker Coordinator A/V Grip Powermeister Vendor Manager Special Event Manager

Registration Manager Badge Checkers Runners Contest Judges

We have not yet established prices for attending or for vendors or exhibitors but if you are interested in coming, selling or showing please let us know.

I plan on being there showing my TI CC-40 collection, and will probably also have  an  A2000  and  possibly  my Minimig up and running.

We definitely  need  a  strong  Amiga presence! Surely there is someone near the DFW area who can set up a table demonstrating the Amiga line!
