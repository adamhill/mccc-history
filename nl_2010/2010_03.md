## Multitasking and the Amiga

February has been punctuated by repeated snowstorms around here, followed by repeated snow shoveling, followed by repeated curses as the snow comes back. So far 2010 is shaping up to be an interesting time in the Amiga world. With developments such  as  the  Amiga  One  X1000 hardware somewhere on the horizon, and MorphOS slowly expanding its coverage from the Mac Mini to other PPC-based Mac hardware, the year, or maybe the decade, is showing some potential for growth for the first time in a long time. It's only fitting as the 25 th  anniversary of the release of the original Amiga 1000 draws close that we  get  a  glimmer  of  new  hope, however small it might be.

I've often talked in the past about how the Amiga excelled in advantages that doubled as disadvantages at other times or circumstances. The Amiga was  famous  for  being  the  first consumer-level computer with a full pre-emptive multitasking operating system. This was quite the challenge to do affordably in the latter half of the eighties, as most other examples of multitasking required hardware support,  such  as  a  memory management unit (which could have priced the system out of the market at the time), but it was managed. The early Amiga OS got a reputation for being  crash-prone,  as  software programmers learned how to code for a multitasking OS, making sure their program didn't step on the toes of other tasks that might be running at the same time. The end result was mostly stable, as good or better than most of its contemporaries, but the lack of on-board hardware resource management meant a big enough error could still take the whole system down with it. Over the years, the Mac and  Windows  slowly  waded  into multitasking, first with limited and crippled  forms  where  only  one program actually ran no matter how many were open, or the resources any program could use were set from the start. Eventually Windows, Mac and others  came  to  pre-emptive multitasking, thanks in no small part to CPUs with memory management becoming affordable at the consumer level.

By the time the others adopted true multitasking, they didn't have to solve the  problem  of  doing  so  without hardware help. The advantage the MMU provides makes it easier for separate  tasks  to  keep  from overlapping the resources they use, and  one  failing  program  can  be stopped  and  removed  without dragging the rest down with it. It was around  this  time  the  Amiga's multitasking started becoming more of a liability. As the AmigaOS was designed  to  multitask  without hardware memory management, it wasn't possible to just add it in, not without breaking the software that already runs. To be honest this was an issue for the other operating systems too. Mac OS reinvented itself as the Unix-based  OSX  to  achieve  true multitasking, and Windows did much the same. There were problems with older software breaking under the multitasking system (Mac OSX was not compatible with older software at all,  except when running an older version of the operating system as a separate process) but the problems passed quickly as they plowed ahead, knowing that any software publishers would either release new versions that work properly or be left behind.

Unfortunately years of uncertainty and inviability left the Amiga OS marginalized with hardly any serious software developers remaining, and its modern descendants, MorphOS and  Amiga  OS4,  dependent  on compatibility with years-old, even decades-old  software,  and  the baggage of instabilities that come with it. As a contrast, the AROS Amiga-like system does not currently support  classic  Amiga  software transparently, which means the only software available for it is that which is specifically written for it - which isn't  much  at  this  time.  Perhaps updates would bring in more stability, either with new software replacing old,  or  the  system  managing  to shoehorn resource management onto the classic software. It's hard to say either way, but it's fun to hope. I'll be watching either way, if only because Windows, Mac, and Linux still annoy me  in  ways  the  Amiga  and  its relatives don't.

## Hyperion and A-EON

Hyperion Entertainment CVBA and A-EON Technology CVBA announce strategic partnership

Brussels, Belgium February 20, 2010

Hyperion  Entertainment  and  AEON have entered into a strategic partnership to provide the Amiga community with a dedicated high-end PowerPC based platform for AmigaOS 4.x which aspires to be worthy of the Amiga hardware tradition going back to  the  original  Amiga  1000  from Commodore.

The massively expandable AmigaOne X1000 will inspire both current and former AmigaOS users and will also appeal to those looking to exploit the incredibly  versatile  onboard functionality offered by the unique 'Software Defined Silicon' technology from XMOS (www.xmos.com) which, in true Amiga tradition, provides the AmigaOne  X1000  with  a  custom chipset  of  potentially  unparalleled flexibility and scalability.

Software development by Hyperion to bring AmigaOS 4.1, the most advanced incarnation of AmigaOS ever, to the AmigaOne X1000 hardware has been ongoing for quite some time and is progressing very well.

More details  about  the  AmigaOne X1000 hardware and housing will be forthcoming  from  A-EON Technology shortly.

## Google's Experimental Network

2/10/2010 08:00:00 AM

Imagine sitting in a rural health clinic, streaming three-dimensional medical imaging over the web and discussing a unique condition with a specialist in New York. Or downloading a highdefinition, full-length feature film in less than five minutes. Or collaborating with classmates around the world while watching live 3-D video of a university lecture. Universal, ultra high-speed Internet access will make all this and more possible. We've urged the FCC to look at new and creative ways to get there in its National Broadband Plan and  today  we're  announcing  an experiment of our own.

We're planning to build and test ultra high-speed broadband networks in a small number of trial locations across the  United  States.  We'll  deliver Internet speeds more than 100 times faster than what most Americans have access  to  today  with  1  gigabit  per second, fiber-to-the-home connections. We  plan  to  offer  service  at  a competitive price to at least 50,000 and potentially up to 500,000 people.

Our goal is to experiment with new ways to help make Internet access better and faster for everyone. Here are some specific things that we have in mind:

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Next generation apps: We want to see what developers and users can do with ultra high-speeds, whether it's  creating  new  bandwidthintensive 'killer apps' and services, or other uses we can't yet imagine.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; New deployment techniques: We'll test  new  ways  to  build  fiber networks, and to help inform and support deployments elsewhere,

## March Calendar

March 1 - Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter 7:00 PM - Main Grand Prairie Library 901 Conover Drive, Grand Prairie

March 1 - MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approximately 9:15 PM - Location TBD

March 26 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 AM

MCCC      4418 Sharpsburg Drive      Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org

- we'll share key lessons learned with the world.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Openness  and  choice:  We'll operate an 'open access' network, giving users the choice of multiple service providers. And consistent with  our  past  advocacy,  we'll manage our network in an open, non-discriminatory  and transparent way.

Like our WiFi network in Mountain View, the purpose of this project is to experiment  and  learn.  Network providers are making real progress to expand  and  improve  high-speed Internet access, but there's still more to be done. We don't think we have all the answers - but through our trial, we  hope  to  make  a  meaningful contribution to the shared goal of delivering faster and better Internet for everyone.

As a first step, today we're putting out a request for information (RFI) to help identify interested communities. We welcome responses from local government, as well as members of the public. If you'd like to respond, visit this page to learn more, or check out our video.

We'll collect responses until March 26, and  will  announce  our  target communities later this year. Stay tuned.
