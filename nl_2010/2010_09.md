## Amiga Led The Way

It  seems  to  be  the  time  for anniversaries in the Amiga market. August marked the tenth year since the very first public release of the MorphOS operating system. Back then  it  was  restricted  to  Amiga systems with PowerPC accelerator cards by Phase5. Fitting as MorphOS was the end result of Phase5's early development  work  to  bring  the Amiga  operating  system  to  the PowerPC CPU, before they had the rug pulled out from under them by circumstance  and  ruthless competition for other developers.

Much as Phase5 no longer exists in its late-nineties form, MorphOS is quite different from its early self, and different from the early intentions of its developers as well. At a recent show, a 'technology demonstration' was  made  showing  MorphOS running on a Powermac G5, a big step up from the G4 eMac and Mac Mini currently supported. At this point the demonstration was more a proof-of-concept than a practical application, and no promises were made. Currently it's easy to assume that any G5 Mac support is well off into the future, with more G4-based models  like  the  Powermac  and (hopefully)  Powerbook/iBook coming first. Still, I would imagine a lot of MorphOS fans are chomping at  the  bit  for  G5  support,  which would be some extreme horsepower for our Amiga software on an Amigalike operating system.

The other anniversary here is the true biggie. July marked twenty-five years since the official debut of the Amiga 1000 computer under Commodore. One can only imagine how far the system  might  have  gone  if Commodore had a handle on how to market it properly, or at least hold fast to the desktop video niche the Amiga practically invented and had to itself for a few years. There have been  a  few  historical  tributes  by various people and groups, including a video from Hyperion with a visual depiction of the development of the Amiga operating system software. I have plans for my own animated 25 th anniversary  tribute,  but  with  all reasonably  ambitious  projects,  I might be lucky to finish it before the year is over, so I won't make any guarantees. Perhaps its completion will  be  something  like  the  actual Amiga 1000's release--announced in the summer, but actually getting in

' … now every system worth its salt uses a 'GPU' of some description,  following  the Amiga's lead of independent graphic and sound co-processors … '

the  public's  hands  shortly  before Christmas. I'll try my best not to disappoint, again like the Amiga.

After twenty-five years, the Amiga is probably not as well remembered as it should be. The victors write the history, which means a lot of people probably  think  the  first 'microcomputers' from the 1970s ran an early version of Windows 95. It's unfortunate, as the Amiga made such a huge contribution to home computing as a whole. There are many things that, while the Amiga might not have invented them, it refined them and brought them from the realm of expensive professional systems  to  the  home  user.  The Amiga's custom co-processors for graphics and sound, along with their ability  to  do  their  own  thing independently of the main CPU, was its big highlight at its height. It was a pretty unique approach at the time, but now every system worth its salt uses a 'GPU' of some description, following  the  Amiga's  lead  of independent graphic and sound coprocessors and running ahead with it in  the  form  of  video  and  sound cards, often with their own dedicated memory.

It's truly ironic that Windows PC users back in the day often dismissed the Amiga as an inexpensive game machine, when the later Windowsdominated gaming market demanded the most expensive hardware for the best performance (while most nongaming  uses  were  far  less demanding).

The Amiga's small, fast, and efficient operating  system,  with  full preemptive multitasking (AKA the 'good' kind of multitasking) was a powerful feature since the early 1.x versions.  It  was  also  the  only consumer-level  system  with multitasking for a long time. Mac and Windows would eventually work their  way  up  to  preemptive multitasking capabilities, but took years,  major  rewrites,  and  the proliferation of hardware memory protection to do what the Amiga was already  doing  close  to  a  decade earlier. They didn't do it running from a  floppy  disk  either.  The  Amiga's HAM (hold-and-modify)  graphics mode was stunning in its ability to display the system's full palette of 4096  colors  at  once,  even  more stunning  in  that  it  displayed  12 bitplanes worth of data using only six (or on later AGA machines, between 18 and 24 bits using eight) at a slight cost in image quality. We didn't know quite what to call it at the time, but now such things are known as 'lossy image compression,' and commonly used now in such things as JPEG images and MPEG video (a different form of compression, but it's all about cramming a lot of image data into a small space).

The Amiga practically invented the concepts  of  'multi-media'  and 'desktop video,' although like the lossy image  compression,  others  were coining the terminology for the things we were just doing. The Amiga may have been surpassed in capacity, and lost  its  niche  as  digital  video supplanted the analog, but its very presence left its mark on the industry, showing many a better way to do things.

It's noteworthy that upon its debut, the Amiga already had the majority of features people take for granted on computer systems today, such as fullcolor graphics (capable of 3D imagery even),  digital  stereo  sound,  and  a multi-tasking operating system. All that's missing is the ubiquitous mass storage, USB, and network/Internet support of today's systems, and that's mainly because most of that wasn't available to the average consumer in 1985 (or even invented yet in USB's case). If only the competitors listened a  little  bit  harder  to  the  Amiga's example, maybe we wouldn't be so frustrated  with  the  systems  that supposedly 'won' the battle for the marketplace.  Who  knows  where computers will be in another 25 years, but as long as some Amiga influence remains, it won't be all bad.

## An HDMI Replacement?

According  to  the  HDBaseT  press release,  LG  Electronics,  Samsung Electronics,  Sony  Pictures Entertainment  and  Valens Semiconductor are working to kill HDMI. They are trying to replace it with  a  new  standard  which  will transport the video and audio signals through an ethernet cable. The new stardard will be called HDBaseT.

'The cornerstone of HDBaseT technology is 5Play, an unrivaled feature-set that converges full uncompressed HD video, audio, 100BaseT Ethernet, high power over cable and various control signals  through  a  single 100m/328ft  CAT5e/6  LAN cable.  HDBaseT  has  the bandwidth to support the highest video resolutions such as full HD 1080p as well as 3D and 2Kx4K formats. HDBaseT is the first to provide all-in-one connectivity, making it possible for a singleconnector TV to receive power, video/audio, Internet and control signals from the same cable.'

The goal of the technology is to allow all of your devices to be networked together  which  will  allow communication and media sharing throughout the entire house. The technology is expected to be available by  the  second  half  of  2011. Companies will be able to license the technology this year which means we should see some of devices show up at CES 2011 in January.

In  the  past  when  industry  groups create new standards for audio and video delivery they create a proprietary cable to go with it, but with HDBaseT any Cat 5e/6 cable that you might have laying around will get the job done.
