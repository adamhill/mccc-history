## The Pioneering Amiga

Last month I talked about the up-anddownsides to the Amiga's preemptive multitasking (specifically the type that did not require a memory management unit which worked on less expensive hardware). This month my subject is what  was  considered  a  defining advantage of the Amiga for years - its custom  graphic  and  sound  coprocessor chips.

I used to consider the Amiga's custom chips a double-edged sword in much the same way, and in some ways it was. The chips gave the Amiga systems a tremendous advantage at the start, but a dependence on that same hardware made it difficult to advance and keep pace with the hardware developments of competing systems. (Years of limbo following Commodore going under didn't help either.) Looking at it with a little more objectivity and hindsight, I view it now more as a difference in philosophy and some foot-dragging on the software front.

The  foot-dragging  is  in  relation  to separating (or abstracting, as some say) graphic  and  sound  functions  of software  and  the  operating  system from a specific set of hardware, thus making it easier to change or update that hardware without a corresponding rewrite of the software side. Late or not, it  was  eventually  done.  The  3.X versions of the Amiga OS, along with software such as CybergraphX and Picasso96, introduced the base of the RTG (Re-Targetable Graphics) Amiga era. AHI did much the same for the audio side. Before then, while there was video and sound hardware for the Amiga, software had to be specifically written  to  use  it.  Next-generation systems such as Amiga OS4, MorphOS, and AROS took it a step further, taking advantage  of  advanced  features  of modern video cards. It was mostly out of  necessity,  as  the  new  operating systems had to run on the modular hardware of the  time.  As  it  stands, most software that 'follows the rules' runs much the same on whatever video hardware it's running on. This is in contrast  to  the  earlier  times,  when Amiga software was tied directly to the stock hardware, 'banging the metal,' as they used to say.

Part of the reason for the delays in a more hardware-abstract Amiga system was the philosophies of the time, the hardware and the people who wrote software for it. The Amiga, in fact most modern systems born in the 'eighties,' were the next generation to various 'closed' systems that weren't known for having  a  lot  of  expandability  or hardware variation - your Ataris, your Apples, your Commodores. The Amiga was also born, in part, of the desire to create a kickass gaming system, another hardware field not commonly having much variety between examples of the same  brand.  By  contrast,  the DOS/Windows PCs, and the Macs and Atari STs to a lesser extent, used more off-the-shelf hardware compared to the custom-designed coprocessors of the Amiga. The (formerly IBM) PC stood out especially by being more a set of specifications than a specific set of hardware, manufactured and assembled by various companies. In a market like that, software writers had to work for a wider array of hardware support, either writing  for  several  hardware configurations at once, or writing for the operating system, and letting it do the heavy lifting between software and display or speakers. On a 'narrower' spec like the Amiga (especially in the days before the A3000 came out) it was common  to  write  software  that accessed the custom chips directly, as it  was  more  efficient  and  usually yielded better performance. Games generally  'banged  the  metal'  the hardest, even throwing out operating system routines entirely to squeeze out that extra bit of performance, memory, or disk space for a better experience. This is all fine and good until one starts  tinkering  with  their  Amiga's hardware,  such  as  expanding  the memory, getting a CPU accelerator, or even trading up to a new A1200 or A4000 with new architecture, CPU, custom chips, and more. The diversity of  hardware  specifications  and performance widens as well between low-end (A1200, 14mhz 68020, AGA chips) and high (A4000T, 50 MHz 68060 and PPC, multiple drives, AGA, and extra video and sound cards). It's under those circumstances that metalbanging software breaks, and the case for  hardware  abstraction  becomes more apparent. Early on it seemed the hardware drove the software, both by its capabilities and its limitations. Now in this Windows-dominated climate, the software dictates the hardware quite  often,  forcing  the  user  to upgrade if they want to run the latest applications or (especially) games.

Whether the world at large remembers it or not, the Amiga and its custom chips were a pioneering force for the way things are done now. The Amiga's video and audio co-processors took the  load  off  the  main  processor, providing great performance as they could work independently. The early video cards on Windows and other systems did little more than just put the display on the screen, leaving the real work to the CPU. They may have been able to put more colors up on the  screen,  but  when  it  came  to manipulating the graphics, the Amiga and its specialized hardware had the edge, even under a slower CPU. As the CPUs got faster and faster, the video cards added more and more features as well,  including  the  ability  to  act independently of the CPU, taking that page from the Amiga book. While it's easy  to  look  at  the  Amiga's  custom chips as something that held the system back in its later years after pushing it forward in its early days, I prefer to look at  the  super-hyper-polygon-pushing video cards found on the heavy duty gaming Windows PCs, and thank the Amiga for starting the party.

## The National Broadband Plan

(Note:  for  the  full  text  of  the  plan,  go  to http://www.broadband.gov/plan/)

Preface

The  staff  of  the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created the National Broadband Plan. To an extraordinary extent, however, the author of this plan is America itself.

The FCC started the process of creating this plan with a Notice of Inquiry in April 2009. Thirty-six public workshops held at the FCC and streamed online, which drew more than 10,000 in-person or  online  attendees,  provided  the framework  for  the  ideas  contained within the plan. These ideas were then refined based on replies to 31 public notices, which generated some 23,000 comments totaling about 74,000 pages from more than 700 parties. The FCC also received about 1,100 ex parte filings totaling some 13,000 pages and nine public hearings were held throughout the country to further clarify the issues addressed in the plan.

The FCC also engaged in significant collaboration and conversations with other  government  agencies  and Congress, since the scope of the plan included many issues outside of the FCC's  traditional  expertise.  Many people  from  across  government contributed expertise and advice along the way, for which the FCC staff is eternally grateful.

The Internet also provided new ways to involve  the  public.  Through  an innovative  Web  presence  at www.broadband.gov, the FCC posted more than 130 blog entries and received nearly 1,500 comments in return. The FCC's Twitter feed now has more than 330,000 followers, making it the third most popular government Twitter feed after the White House and the Centers for Disease Control.

The FCC staff digested this extensive record and worked long hours analyzing and  debating  the  record.  Every comment cannot be referenced in the plan, but they were all read, considered and valued.

Public comment on the plan does not end here. The record will guide the path forward through the rulemaking process at the FCC, in Congress and across the Executive Branch, as all consider how best  to  implement  the  plan's
