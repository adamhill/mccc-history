## AmigaOne X1000 Update

The AmigaOne X1000 is not like other computers. It's based on a PowerPC CPU architecture, it includes Xena, a 'Software  Defined  Silicon'  coprocessor,  and  above  all  it  runs AmigaOS 4.

It is 25 years since the launch by US computer company Commodore of the Amiga A1000, a revolutionary machine that introduced multimedia and multitasking to the world. While AmigaOS has continued in development (making it possibly the longest developed and used desktop OS in the world) the hardware side has had a harder time of it  since  the  demise  of  Amiga's  old parent company, Commodore.

2010  is  the  year  we  come  back. A-EON technology, in co-operation with  a  small  group  of  mainly European companies, are creating a new high-end, prestige platform that will  once  more  allow  the  Amiga Operating System to shine.

The  X1000  ends  the  years  of AmigaOS being relegated to a ghetto of outdated hardware - great as it was at the time, the world has moved on  a  long  way  since  the  days  of Commodore.  For  the  first  time  in many years, AmigaOS has a genuinely modern hardware platform.

## Xena - Software Defined Silicon

Our hardware designers had a brilliant idea: 'Why not add an XMOS chip?'

![Image](2010_05_artifacts/image_000001_c519c4cf44d08f1f44bf2da3a259786bee10665274f0e0de3c3e20a1b67eefca.png)

Once there were custom chips; for the AmigaOne  X  generation,  we  have customisable  chips.  XMOS  calls  it 'Software Defined Silicon,' we call it 'Xena,' a nod to the old custom chip names.  It's  the  inheritor  of  the 'transputer' concept, and it's something we're quite excited about.

Capable of eight concurrent real-time threads with shared memory space, at up to 500 MIPS, Xena gives the X1000 a  very  flexible,  very  expandable co- processor.  The  uses  are  endless; control  hardware,  DSP  functions, robotics, display - even SID chip and console emulators.

Xena is  not  simply  strap-on  extra adding  an  extra  half  GHz  of processing power, it's a different kind of thing to a general purpose CPU altogether.  It's  an  event-driven processor, which means it can respond immediately to events such as external signals, rather than having to wait on an interrupt. This makes it appropriate to  true  real-time  functions.  It  has many input/output lines which are software configurable, making it ideal for ultra-low latency data sampling applications and extremely easy to turn into  control  hardware  for…  well, virtually anything. The I/O can also be configured to communicate with extra XMOS  chips  that  can  run  the processor's code in a highly parallel fashion,  and  for  serious  power applications  you  can  just  keep  on adding processors.

The  Amiga  has  seen  some  truly ingenious hacks and add-ons; Xena can take this to a whole new level. It will  take  a  while  for  the  full possibilities to be realised, but we urge you to visit XMOS and discover more for yourselves.

## Xorro - connecting Xena to the world

To  accompany  'Xena,'  we  have 'Xorro,' a new slot using an industrystandard PCIe x8 form factor to give access to the 'Xena' IO. This will be the route to Xena's IO lines, which are dynamically  configurable  as  input, output, or bidirectional. 'Xorro' will allow  bridging  Xena  to  external hardware for control  purposes,  to internal systems, or to other Xcore processors.

Xena has 64 of these configurable I/O lines. In the AmigaOne X1000 we have one quarter of these connected to the CPU local bus for direct communication with the system, whilst the other threequarters are connected directly to pins on the Xorro slot for communication with  the  outside  world.  JTAG connection for control and debugging of the XMOS silicon is accessible both through  the  CPU's  GPIO  (General Purpose Input/Output) lines and the Xorro interface.

Hardware designed for the Xorro slot may be as simple as a few traces running from  the  slot  lanes  to  an  external connector  with  minimal  or  no voltage/level control. This is the kind of arrangement you'd expect for a board designed to use Xena for hardware control applications, where all the control  logic  is  performed  in software by Xena rather than in non-reusable  custom  ASIC hardware on the board, or using tricky programmable logic via an FPGA or similar. A more complicated board might include some hardware to deal with Xena's output - drivers for an  IR  transceiver  for  computer controlled RC applications, or pre-amp circuitry for networked audio. For really serious applications, you might have a Xorro board with an array of additional XMOS chips on, connected together to allow highly multi-threaded applications to run in parallel, in a similar fashion to the famous Transputer concept, the predecessor of the XMOS technology. Reference designs have been made with 256  cores,  offering  a  theoretical processing power of over 100,000 MIPS.

- Q. What graphics card will be supplied with  the  A1-X1000  and  what  other cards will be supported. Does the PCI Express open up the option for more modern graphics cards with the latest ATI, nVidia and PhysX etc chipsets (Andy)?
- A.  PCI-e  does  indeed  open  up  the

release  or  will  this  feature  be implemented  later?  (Multiple)  For example, will it be able to run individual operating  systems  on  each  core simultaneously.  The  teaser  website displayed the A1-X1000 CPU running both cores at 1.6GHz full load. Have you tested it any higher since and what is the maximum CPU rating?

- A.  In  the  initial  A1-X1000  release, AmigaOS 4.1 will not make use of the second CPU core but this is something that the OS4 developers are planning for a subsequent update. Without a virtualizer, it will not be possible to run two OS's at the same time - there is more than just the CPU involved in that (memory for example, or any other system resource). To date all A1-X1000

option of more modern graphics cards, but not without drivers. This is the hard part.  ATI  have  become increasingly open-source friendly when it comes to releasing details of their hardware to allow drivers to be written, nVidia not so much. Over the long term, there will be changes to the way AmigaOS handles drivers that will make it considerably easier to bring new hardware to the platform as it is released. In the short term,  we  have  specified  a  single hardware/driver combination that will ship with the X1000 as standard, based on the ATI R700 GPU.

And finally a question from Andy who works for E.ON (pronounced 'ee on') in the UK.

- Q. How do you actually pronounce AEON?
- A. We pronounce it 'ay-on', with the 'ay'  similar  to  'ay'  sound  in  'hay.' (Technical note: the name is influenced by, but isn't actually, the traditional British spelling of 'eon', 'aeon'. It's also an anagram of 'A-One', so the 'A' might stand for Amiga. Normally the word aeon is pronounced 'ee-on' due to  the  transition  from  Greek  'aion' through latin 'aeon'. The original Koine Greek  pronunciation  would  be something like 'eye-on'.)
