## Spin-based Electronics

The next generation of computers may make use of the 'spin' of electrons instead of their charge.

Spintronics relies on manipulating these spins to make them capable of carrying data. The technique has been  shown  in  a  number  of materials  at  low  temperatures before. But researchers writing in Nature have made use of these 'spin-polarized' electrons in silicon at room temperature for the first time.  The  result  could  lead  to computers that require far less power than conventional ones.

The fact that the effect has been demonstrated in silicon - the material that already underpins the computer industry - means that devices exploiting it could be made on a commercial scale more easily. The problem with silicon is that, as the individual features on silicon chips get smaller and smaller, they require more and more power to move  the  charged  electrons around to represent 0s and 1s of binary code. That rise in power also means that future chips will run into problems with heating.

Spintronics has long been touted as a future potential mechanism for computing, but so far advances have come slowly. The idea rests on manipulating the 'spins' of electrons, which can be either 'up' or 'down,' a choice between two states  that  is  analogous  to  the on/off  or  zero/one  of conventional, digital electronics.

This 'spin' isn't really a direction the electrons are spinning in, but rather a convenient way to express one  of  the  two  'quantum mechanical'  states  an  electron might be found in.

A  number  of  laboratory demonstrations has shown that it is possible to create bunches of electrons with their spins aligned and  to  detect  those  spins  in  a range  of  materials,  most importantly silicon. However, they have all been at extremely low temperatures.

Now, researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands have demonstrated the manipulation and  detection  of  these  spinpolarized electrons in silicon at a temperature some 150ºC warmer than the previous record.

'We've shown for the first time that this  can  be  done  at  room temperature, which is obviously something you would need if you wanted to really commercialize this technology,' said Ron Jansen, who led the research. The trick, Dr Jansen said, was careful design of the interface where the electrons enter the silicon - the materials must be pure and of a precisely determined thickness in order to preserve  the  delicate  spin polarization.

'Let's say it's the first real step towards  a  real  working technology,' Dr Jansen told BBC News. 'The next one is actually to build real electronic circuits and show that they are better than the electronic circuits that we have available right now.'

Robert  Hicken,  a  spintronics researcher at the University of Exeter,  called  the  work  'an important  step  in  the development  of  spintronics technology. This tells us that one can now begin to look at room temperature,  silicon-based electronic  devices;  the  exact design of such a device we don't know  yet,  but  this  was  a prerequisite for doing it.'

What remains unclear, Professor Hicken  told  BBC  News,  is whether spintronics can overcome the  problem  of  heating  that conventional electronics faces as individual devices become ever more tiny.

## Paper Batteries

Stanford scientists are harnessing nanotechnology  to  quickly produce  ultra-lightweight, bendable  batteries  and supercapacitors in the form of everyday paper. Simply coating a sheet of paper with ink made of carbon  nanotubes  and  silver nanowires  makes  a  highly conductive storage device, said Yi Cui, assistant professor of materials science and engineering.

'Society  really  needs  a  low-cost, high-performance energy storage device, such as batteries and simple supercapacitors,'  he  said.  Like batteries, capacitors hold an electric charge, but for a shorter period of time. However, capacitors can store and discharge electricity much more rapidly than a battery.

Cui's work is reported in the paper 'Highly  Conductive  Paper  for Energy Storage Devices,' published online this week in the Proceedings of  the  National  Academy  of Sciences.

'These nanomaterials are special,' Cui  said.  'They're  a  onedimensional structure with very small  diameters.'  The  small diameter helps the nanomaterial ink stick strongly to the fibrous paper, making  the  battery  and supercapacitor very durable. The paper  supercapacitor  may  last through 40,000 charge-discharge cycles  -  at  least  an  order  of magnitude  more  than  lithium batteries. The nanomaterials also make ideal conductors because they move electricity along much more efficiently than ordinary conductors, Cui said.

Cui  had  previously  created nanomaterial energy storage devices using plastics. His new research shows that a paper battery is more durable because the ink adheres more strongly to paper (answering the question, 'Paper or plastic?'). What's more, you can crumple or fold the paper battery, or even soak it in acidic or basic solutions, and the performance does not degrade. 'We  just  haven't  tested  what happens when you burn it,' he said.

The flexibility of paper allows for many clever applications. 'If I want to paint my wall with a conducting energy storage device,' Cui said, 'I can use a brush.' In his lab, he demonstrated  the  battery  to  a visitor by connecting it to an LED (light-emitting  diode),  which glowed brightly.

A paper  supercapacitor  may  be especially useful for applications like electric or hybrid cars, which depend on the quick transfer of electricity.  The  paper supercapacitor's high surface-tovolume ratio gives it an advantage.

'This technology has potential to be commercialized within a short time,' said Peidong Yang, professor of chemistry  at  the  University  of California-Berkeley. 'I don't think

Cui predicts the biggest impact may be in large-scale storage of electricity on the distribution grid. Excess  electricity  generated  at night, for example, could be saved for peak-use periods during the day. Wind farms and solar energy systems also may require storage.

'The most important part of this paper is how a simple thing in daily life - paper - can be used as a substrate  to  make  functional conductive electrodes by a simple process,'  Yang  said.  'It's nanotechnology related to daily life, essentially.'

Cui's  research  team  includes postdoctoral scholars Liangbing Hu  and  JangWook  Choi,  and graduate student Yuan Yang.
