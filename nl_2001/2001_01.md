## Executive Update

## from Bill McEwen November 22, 2000

Dear Amiga Family:

It is now November 2000, eleven months after we took over the helm of Amiga. We have made some changes to the original plan, and continue to do our best in carrying the vision forward.

In the next two weeks, the next new product from Amiga will begin shipping - Amiga OS 3.9! This build has been designed specifically for one group - You, the Amiga family. We have been working very closely with Haage and Partner in creating a great new product offering for Amiga that you will all be very proud of.

Will there be a 4.0? This really depends on the sales of OS 3.9. You see, we did not have any plans for another version of the Classic OS. But we continued to receive requests, and because we listen to community, we decided to move ahead with Haage and Partner on this project. If OS 3.9 sells well, and we see a continuing need to produce for the existing Classic Amiga platform, then there is a strong possibility of a 4.0.

It is in your hands.

No matter what happens, AmigaDE is still moving ahead quickly and we look forward to delivering another version of the Amiga Software Development Kit (SDK) with new features and enhancements. In the coming weeks, we will be adding 3D and sound to AmigaDE.

There are many more exciting things happening at Amiga and I look forward to sharing with you all of the great details, and announcements at the World of Amiga 2000 show - The definitive Amiga show in Cologne, Germany on December 9 and 10. I look forward to meeting all of you there, at the Amiga World tradeshow. Bring a friend!

Looking forward to a great visit in Germany and a wonderful holiday season,

Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga team.

## Executive Update from Bill McEwen

December 23, 2000

Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year to one and all:

Wow, have we been a blessed company. On December 27, 1999 we executed our agreement with Gateway, and January 3rd 2000 was our first day of business.

In one year we have been able to release an upgrade to the AmigaOS (3.9, with our partners Haage and Partner), we have announced and released two versions of the SDK for the New AmigaDE (Digital Environment), we have released the AmigaOne specification and announced two partners in building these new machines, (bPlan, and Eyetech).

Yes, this has been an amazing year.

As we look back upon these last 12 months, there have been many lessons learned, and it is with these new lessons that we will be moving into 2001, with clear focus, and numerous new announcements and deals. Yes, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas will be great fun for Amigans around the world, for it is here that the rest of the world will begin to learn what you already know! :-)

At this time of remembrance and thanks, we are also reminded of our friends that we have lost. Coz, Bob Cosby is very missed and we think of him, and pray daily for his wife Marsha. It has been the most sobering event for Amiga, and it helped us to remember that Family is what makes Amiga great. We are looking to add many new members to the Amiga family this year.

This year has been hard for us in other ways also: the stock market has certainly hindered our ability to raise the capital we wanted to accelerate our plans, and many of us have had to endure financial hardships making the dream of Amiga a reality. The Amiga team is together, and moving ahead quickly towards this new and ß

exciting year.

I want to thank each and every one of you for your continued support and for everyone hanging in there with us.

We are truly a blessed company.

I want to personally wish everyone a very Merry Christmas, and a very Happy New Year.

God Bless, Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga team.

## A New PC

I got a new PC for Christmas. A brand new powerful Windows Me system. The hardware is great, but I sure wish I had a better operating system to run on it… like maybe AmigaOne. Guess I'll spend January working with AmigaOS 3.9. Then, maybe soon, I'll have a new AmigaOne to spend some quality time with.

## The Website

The January update will feature more details about AmigaOS 3.9.
