Also, if there are any volunteers out there that would like to teach a class or demo something, let us know.

A special on memberships will be offered: thirteen months for the price of twelve. We also hope to have a few computers set up so you can ask the club's resident gurus for help and advice.

Your assistance is necessary to make the show a success. If you can help, call me at metro (972) 299-6824, or leave email at marks@amigamccc.org. …Mark Stodola

## Executive Update

June 21, 2001 Greetings To The Amiga Family

There have been some recent mis-representations that I have recently received about Amiga, Inc. and our office locations. Amiga is doing very well, and we are excited about the future of Amiga. The Amiga Family continues to grow with new partners, new products, and the very near release of AmigaDE 1.0.

However with all of this activity there have been some out there who have recently sent out false information about Amiga, and I need to clarify this now.

Amiga Incorporated is headquartered in Snoqualmie, Washington USA.

Amiga Deutschland is still in business. We have only closed the Langen office. There are going to be some new additions, and a new office location announced in the next couple of weeks, but know now that Amiga International was a Gateway company, and was not and has not been associated with Amiga, Inc. since 1999. The dealer in Germany that is making claims that they are Amiga International is completely false, and Amiga Incorporated, the parent ß

o a great year.

IC.

company of Amiga Deutschland, is going to take legal action against those who make these false claims.

There is another dealer in India who has started claiming that they are Amiga in India. This again is also false. Amiga does NOT have any official representation in India outside of the Amiga dealers who are there. Amiga Incorporated is currently evaluating an office in India and other countries where we do business.

To those of you who continue to try and tear Amiga apart, it is time to stop. Amiga is moving forward, there are great things ahead, and for the first time in

## Editor's Comments

I think I'm suffering from withdrawal. I missed the June Amiga-By-The-Loop chapter meeting because I was out of town. Then the July meeting was cancelled due to an air-conditioner breakdown at the North Richland Hills Community Center. Bummer!
