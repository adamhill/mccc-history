## Walker &amp; MCC Designs Sold

Amiga is pleased to announce the sale of the legendary Amiga Walker and MCC designs to Merlancia Industries.

The Walker and MCC designs (created by Frogdesign and Pentagram respectively) are now owned exclusively by Merlancia Industries. These designs will be implemented in Merlancia's MMC/Torro line of multimedia PowerPC products.

The Walker case, designed in

1995-6 by Frogdesign for Escom AG will be implemented in a Space Conservative Desktop unit; expressly useful for offices and cramped desks. The Walker design, currently Merlancia Radian, will feature a PowerPC G3 or G4 (750 and 7410 resp.) processor with an advanced graphics chipset and will be targeted for sale around the $1500 to $2000 price point.

The MCC case, designed in 1999 by Pentagram was planned as Amiga's Multimedia Convergence Console. Merlancia will be implementing this design for its Apocalypse DT and ST series systems, based on the PowerPC 7xx and 8xxx series processors. The MCC design will be implemented in set top box and low cost desktop packages based on the X-Casting Broadband Video delivery method next year for prices ranging between $699 and $1299.

Dr. Ryan E. A. Czerwinski, CEO of Merlancia Industries comments 'We anticipate minor styling changes and modifications, as needed for the implementation of our hardware, none of which will effect the beauty or harmony of the case designs. We will be producing the cases out of stainless steel, with the possibility of other materials being available as well.'

Bill McEwen, President &amp; CEO of Amiga, Inc said 'As ß

Fleamarket

Amiga has transformed itself to a Software company, having Merlancia build new products based on these designs is exciting, and we look forward to seeing more great products from the Merlancia team.'
