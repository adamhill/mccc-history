## Q &amp; A Bill McEwen answers questions

Friday, Jan 5, 2001 First off, I would like to thank Bill for spending his time answering my questions. I realize that very few CEO's would make themselves available to their customers, and I he deserves recognition for doing so.

After reading the 'I Bought a' thread and seeing all the rumours that were being discussed, I thought that it would be useful to the MooBunny community to have these rumours cleared up, at least as much as possible. To achieve this I decided to call Bill McEwen this evening and ask him directly. Following are questions that I asked, paraphrased responses, and some of my impressions and opinions.

I led by asking about AmigaDOS 3.9. I asked him what he felt the value was in upgrading to this release. He responded that it had upgraded Internet functionality that was missing from 3.5, and that it had multimedia players. Bill said that most users will have to evaluate the features of 3.9 for themselves to see if there's any value added. The owners of 3.5 will find that most of the functionality is similar.

My impression is that Amiga has very little interest in the 3.x line of releases. They are totally focused on the new product and have left the fate of 3.x to Haage and Partner. I would not hold out any hope for the future of 680x0 Amigas.

I asked if 3.5 and 3.9 were significant additions to the Amiga revenue. Bill said that they were not, but it wasn't worrisome to them. Bill said that the products were making money, but not a lot. I see this as them pinning their hopes on the future.

As far as their cash goes, they are getting low. Bill said the last few months have been tight, but that they are working on securing more investment. He mentioned several different sources, but said that there was a tier one company looking to invest in Amiga.

My take is that if they don't secure some big financial backers then they might take more drastic measures in order to gain financing. Considering the number of layoffs in the technology sector, and considering that startups are starting to die left and right, there may be a grim future for Amiga. Bill feels confident that they have a product ready to go and hopefully that will impress investors more than some of the ephemeral properties that other startups failed to sell.

We now know that cash is low, but is Amiga failing to meet any of its financial obligations? This question was answered like this: Ted Wallingford can make whatever statement he likes about the situation, but it's not true. I did not press him any further since this was the only substantial rumour. Bill said that if anyone wants to know what the situation is they should talk to Ted Wallingford.

I feel like there might have been a disagreement over a contract and that Ted feels Amiga owes him more than they think they do. Did that make any sense? Who knows. Maybe Ted can clear this up. Incidentally, Bill said that Ted should not have posted his message. I think Bill McEwen and others at Amiga do listen to the community, even if it isn't always evident.

Amiga not exhibiting at Comdex or CES. Bill said that Amiga will only be exhibiting at Amiga trade shows, but that their product will be available through vendors. Bill mentioned several set-top box manufacturers, but I'm sorry that I wasn't able to take their names quickly enough. Bill said that these set-top boxes should be available soon and he said he was excited about other products coming down the pipe. In particular he said there is something that should please Amigans.

Where should Amiga be spending its money? I think they're probably making the right choice for what they can afford, but it would still be nice to see Amiga show up at these spotlight events. If they had more funding, I'm sure they'd be there, but this is another sign that they don't have quite enough money.

I asked Bill if he could give me an argument why an Amiga user should have faith in Amiga and not jump platform and he said that they have been working hard this past year to get products ready. He reiterated that they (this being vendors using Amiga technology) had some products ready to debut and that we should stick around to see them.

My analysis is this: Amiga does not have a product that I as an Amiga user would necessarily want, but that I as a computer geek might dig. We Amiga users are a technological launching platform for a new, possibly cool technology, and Amiga wants us to continue to pay attention to them until it's ready. This explains 3.5 and 3.9, and it explains the early
