## Thoughts

Sometimes I feel a bit like I'm out of it all together. Tonight, just before I started writing this column, I was on the net and took a look at the amiga.org website. I have pretty well given up on Amiga Inc.'s amiga.com site because it gets updated so seldom. Anyway, the amiga.org site gets several items added every day. Admittedly, not all are about Amiga things, for example today a couple things had been added about Microsoft, mostly about and with links to uncomplementary articles about Microsoft but, interestingly, not from the Amiga or Mac community. But I digress. The point I was trying to get to was that there were several entrys about new software or newly available updates to software. My problem was that most of them were products or updates to products I had never heard of. I know that I tend to pretty much stay in my own little niche, which is primarily desktop publishing, so probably 95% of everything I do on the Amiga is done in PageStream and Final Writer. So I lead a rather sheltered life. The point is, however, as much as we tend to worry about being left behind, there are all these new products constantly coming out for the Amiga, so maybe we are not falling as far behind as some of us seem to think. Again, it is hard for me to judge.

I get the feeling that there is still a lot of confusion in the Amiga community, after the St. Louis show, regarding some of the things that were announced there. I felt certain that the announcement that Amiga will continue updates of the current OS beyond 3.9 was a change in direction for them. The further announcement that at some point - and here is part of the confusion regarding whether this happens at 4.0 or sometime later - it would be modified to incorporate the PPC processor as primary and then transition further to become the Amiga DE OS, was also a surprise. Shortly after the show, a statement by McEwen appeared on their web site that the announcements at St. Louis did not constitute any change in Amiga's plans. Say What? For fear of sounding like a broken record, I guess, regardless of what is said and promised, the only real option is to wait and see, and then judge the new OSs on their merit as they become available. The other thing that confuses me is how does all this transitioning DE into the current OS affect all the original commitment that DE would be able to run on nearly any processor or over other OSs? Another confusing thing I read once was, after all the talk about DE being nonprocessor specific, supposedly a benefit of building on the Tao basics, that DE could be quickly converted to another processor in only 45 days. I don't understand! I assume that some day soon all will become crystal clear.

## Party Pack

[Editor's Note: This announcement is somewhat dated. The June 22 nd cutoff means it's too late for any of us to do anything about this (including me). But the announcement still contains interesting information, so I decided to include it here anyway.]

Greetings to members of the Amiga Family. Wow, what a year it has been!

In the coming weeks we are going to see the releases of not one but three new Amiga Products!:

- AmigaOne PPC /1200 - On Schedule and Rockin'
- AmigaOS 4.0, and shortly thereafter AmigaOS 4.2 on schedule for release Summer of '01 and will offer the next generation of Amiga desktop - on PPC!
- AmigaDE 1.1 so the rest of the world may begin to learn the power of Amiga  For Cell Phones, PDAs, and other portable devices.

Because of overwhelming emails and suggestions, Amiga Incorporated is pleased to announce the AmigaOne, AmigaOS 4.0, AmigaOS 4.2, and AmigaDE pre-release party!

## Editor's Comments

Things sure are getting quiet in the Amiga world. The past couple of months I've had to struggle just to fill this two-page newsletter. I remember the days when I had to work to cut it down to 16 pages. Maybe all the new Amiga releases mentioned in the 'Party Pack' article will get things fired up again.

On a personal note, I just got back from a business trip to Italy. It's a tough job, but someone has to do it. Seriously, it's a trip I'd highly recommend.

Ciao, Bill Raecke
