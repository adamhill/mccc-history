## Executive Update

## St. Louis and Beyond

February 06, 2001

Greetings to the Amiga Family:

In Melbourne this last year, I was able to surprise many of you with several announcements that were unexpected, and we delivered on each of those.

Now we have a new show coming up in St. Louis. In a few weeks we will all learn…

Where is the AmigaOne? Will Cringley finally eat his words about a new Amiga? What about AmigaDE on PDA's, Set Top Boxes, Internet Appliances, or even desktops? Will Tom and Nicole stay together or is it over? Is there life for the AmigaOS after 3.9?

Contrary to the rumors and what many people are saying about our demise, or that we are going to have the same fate of the others before us, we have a big surprise for all of them.

I look forward to visiting with all of you in St. Louis, and I look forward to taking over the Hotel, and the surrounding area with the Amiga Spirit and Community.

I hope to see many of you there.

There is still time, and in 6 weeks, it will all be known.

Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga Team

## Future of the Amiga?

St. Louis and Beyond

One of the most pointed questions about Amiga Inc. has been 'Will they survive?' An answer seems to be close at hand.

In December 2000, Amiga's President Bill McEwen failed to appear, as previously announced, at the World of Amiga 2000 on December, 9 th and 10 th in Cologne, Germany. Word in Amiga circles was that Bill was meeting with 'some very important Japanese' and was unable to attend.

Next, this item appeared.

DoCoMo, Sony To Create Mobile Phone Game System from http://www.slashdot.com/

Posted by Timothy on Monday January 29, @10:28AM from the repetitive-stress dept.

A developer writes: 'Sony and DoCoMo announced they will jointly develop on-line games worldwide. Sony, Motorola and JVC have greatly invested in a new Sun Authorized Java Virtual Machine which is also being used in the new Amiga computer. Founder of the UK based Tao Group and ex-Amiga developer Mr. Charig just returned from Japan for the launch of DoCoMo`s new Java technology based i appli service. Interestingly, Tao demonstrated its technology running on the Dreamcast a year ago, as well, and recently it was announced that Sega is going to make games for new set-top boxes and mobile phones. BTW every C, C++, Java or Vitual Assembler written Amiga/Tao application can be executed code identical on top of other operation systems as well, including Linux. edhak also points to this BBC article on the possibility of worldwide handheld wirelessly distributed games, and gloats 'Wipeout on a mobile!'

Then, on February 1, 2001 the following announcement was distributed over Amiga news services.

PDA Projects Development Opportunities

There is tremendous potential for distribution of your applications, games and other content for one of the world's largest manufacturers of PDA hardware. The projection is for more than 7 million units to be sold by the end of 2001 and there are already several million units on the market at this time. There will be specific requirements as far as style, type of applications, distribution rights and certification of content.

On February 6, the latest Executive Update was released. Draw your own conclusions.

## Why?

- Why don't you ever see the headline 'Psychic Wins Lottery!'?
- Why is 'abbreviated' such a long word?
- Why is a boxing ring square?
- Why is it called lipstick if you can still move your lips after you use it?
- Why is it necessary to nail down the lid of a coffin?
- Why is what doctors do called 'practice'?
- Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?
- Why is the third hand on a watch called a second hand?

## Amiga OS 3.9

I finally got it installed. No major breakthroughs, but the interface is more professional with each upgrade and the multimedia stuff is nice… and fast! And I especially like AmiDock. It's not as powerful as ToolsManager, but it's a lot easier to use. (I still use ToolsManager… just not for docks.)
