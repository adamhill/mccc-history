## AmigaDE Player Released

October 24, 2001 - Snoqualmie, WA

Amiga announced today that it has released AmigaDE Player 1.0 for both Microsoft Windows and Linux.

The Amiga Digital Environment Player is the first step towards its vision of the Digital Habitat™ and is core to the foundation of binary portability and delivery of content to different platforms and products.

The AmigaDE Player is built through a partnership with the Tao-Group of Reading England and utilizes the intent media system as its foundation.

Using this technology, Amiga is able to provide users the ability to access applications written for the Amiga Digital Environment on standard desktop computers as well as other devices; such as the Compaq iPaq, Casio Cassiopeia, Sharp Zaurus or the Psion NetBook in the very near future.

The first release is for the Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms, with AmigaDE Players in development for PocketPC, EPOC, Palm, WinCE, and other systems to be released in the coming months.

Current applications written for the Amiga Digital Environment were targeted for handheld devices but will also run on desktop computers. The content created is binary portable. Content currently available and being created will run on Set Top Boxes,

Information Appliances, HandHeld Computers, Cell Phones and Digital Televisions.

'We see this as the beginning of a digital revolution where the user's computing experience is more simplified. Developers can focus on creating great content rather than having to focus on writing applications for specific devices,' stated Bill McEwen, President and CEO of Amiga Inc. 'Users will see and use Amiga content, in cars, planes, homes, and offices. This is only the beginning.'

Along with the release of the AmigaDE Player, five applications were released to run within the new environment. Amiga has over 3,000 developers creating applications for the new AmigaDE.

The AmigaDE Player and applications can be purchased from the AmigaDE shop website at http://de.amiga.com.

## Two AmigaDE Games

Snoqualmie, WA October 29, 2001 Zeoneo have announced two new applications that run on the AmigaDE Player. The games are Planet Zed , a classic-style vertical scroll shoot `em up providing intense spaceship battles over varied terrain and Convex , an addictive puzzle game. Both games come with superb 16-bit graphics and multi-channel sound.

The AmigaDE Player from Amiga, Inc. is based on the intent multimedia engine from the Tao Group of Reading, England, and provides binary portability across a number of platforms. Amiga has released the AmigaDE Player for Linux and Microsoft Windows. The games from Zeoneo and the AmigaDE Player are available from the AmigaDE shop web site at http://de.amiga.com.

Early reviewers of the Zeoneo games have raved over the quality of the graphics and the addictive nature of the games. ' Planet Zed pays homage to the wonderful spirit of the classic Arcade era whilst dragging it into the future and demonstrating that games can be fun again,' said Fleecy Moss, Chief Technology Officer of Amiga, Inc.

'Zeoneo is excited to be working with Amiga in creating quality games for the AmigaDE Player' said Matthew Kille, founder of Zeoneo.

We look forward to being at the forefront of this new revolution.'

always been known for the excellent quality of its multimedia content and Matt carries on that proud Amiga tradition,' said Bill McEwen, President and CEO of Amiga, Inc.

## Editor's Comments

Last month, in this space, I mentioned that I was looking forward to the release of the AmigaOne computers. No sooner did the newsletter go to the printer when the announcement was made that the AmigaOne would be delayed until 2002. You may have seen the announcement on the club web page updates for November or elsewhere. I guess that means that we all keep waiting a while longer. In the meantime, finding something to print is becoming more difficult. This is probably the first time that I have filled a newsletter with press releases. If you have an article in you, please send it to me. …Bill Raecke
