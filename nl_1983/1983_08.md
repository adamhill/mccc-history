- and for those members who may live close to you.
* Although it shouldn't need mentioning, please be considerate when you call group leader asking for help. These people are volunteers and none claimed to be computer experts. We all want to learn more, but sometimes our questions can't be simply answered. Sometimes you have to just buckle an effort to learn. Please acknowledge the
- sacrifice our group leaders have made in order to help.
* Many thanks to Patrick McCoy and Ken Widner for their presentations processing and printers. If you have interesting idea for a program, please contact Garry or Brett Spivey.

## *** SCREEN PRINT ROUTINE ***

## by Garry Wordelman

This screen print routine. allows a screen dump to the printer. revised from the June/July of COMMODORE MAGAZINE. not very fast but it really works. use it in a program, add a statement such as

100 GET A#: IF A$ =CHR$ (133) THEN GOSUB 4100

This allows you to use the F1 function key to call the sub-routine. It is wise to use this during a time pause or after an INPUT requirement. Note that SI$(14) can be used for double. width characters in Line 4100. To get a normal screen print centered on your printed page, change the "00" in Lines 4280 and 4290 to "20".
