## *** PRESIDENT'S NOTES ***

Congratulations to all: the ·new: 1984 club officers. I think that you've elected great group to keep the club going and growing. I know that you '11 give our President-elect Diane Dews the same wonderful support you've given me.

It's very important that you attend the December meeting to vote on the proposed changes in the constitution which will allow us to re-organize. I want to emphasize that the club is merely re-structuring so as to provide each member with the most benefits. With smaller groups you will find software exchange to be much less hectic, the communication better and access to the club library improved. At the same time, the large size of the total organization will allow a quality newsletter, more secure financial structure, a large library for the benefit of all members, and a large pool of talented members. Keep in mind that dues will go up to $20 per year in January, but if you renew or join before the end of the year dues Will remain at $15.

As the year-end approaches, I thought it might be interesting to recap little of the background of the club. Last January. about five of recent Commodore owners (B. Nelson, K. Widner, F. Wiest, 5. Stockdale and I) got together to talk about forming a user's group. The first organization meeting was held at the Hurst Public Library on February 20th. Over 90 people attended as we elected interim officers and proposed the constitution. We started with 16 paid members. In March we adopted the constitution. and received donated Public Domain software to begin our library. In April, our current officers were elected and the first newsletter was published. In May, we outgrew the library and moved, to our current meeting place at the Rec Center. our membership has since grown to about 310.

I'd like to thank each of you for the support and encouragement you've given me during the past year. I've enjoyed working with and for you and feel sure we have the biggest and best Commodore club in Texas. Here's wishing you happy holidays and a successful new year! ************************************************************. ***

## *** LIBRARY NOTICE ***

On Page 2 of the software catalogue which was published last month, the right-hand column of Disk ID numbers annotate your catalogues with these ID's: EI, FA, GA, GB, and GC. Also, if you have any software related to photography, please contact either of the club librarians, Leonard Parker or Jesse Carden.

## *** EDITOR'S NOTE ***

I apologize for my tardiness in getting, this issue in the mail, however I hope you'll forgive me after you peruse the many pages of programs and aids in this year-end edition. Because our club has grown so much throughout the year, the club officers felt it would be a good idea to re-print the helpful articles from past newsletters. If you have joined the club recently, this should bring you up to date. If you're an original member who's used previous newsletters to start a roaring fire, here's a second chance to learn from these articles.

As this is my last edition, I would especially like to thank those of you who have sent articles and programs to me to include in the newsletter. I know that Barbar and Mike Cramer will appreciate anything anybody sends them, so please.....share your knowledge.

Steve Scott sends these two helpful notes...

*For those of you who have wordpro III, the Cardco interface and printer other than the CBM printer, here's an aid which will allow yOU to use your full wordpro capability. First, type in · the following line in direct mode before you load the 'BOOT' program:

```basic
OPEN4, 4,25: CMD 4 :PRINT#4: CLOSE4 <RETURN>
```

The secondary address of '25' locks the interface into its non-CBM mode. Now. after you load and execute the program, select 'OTHER' for the printer type and 'A' for the ASCII format. These two steps should be all that's necessary for you and WordPrOIII.

*The next item concerns uploading wordpro files to a remote terminal or computer via modem, such as to STARmail on STARTEXT. WordPrO normally creates program files. For modem communications, however, files must be sequential. command - a ‹CONTROL› 'O'. When you're in the OUTPUT mode, type 'd'. When asked whether you want CBM, ASCII, or Multi-user, select Multiuser to send your file to another user via modem. wordpro with Smartterm 64, don't start your file name with an 'X'. sane Can ACt, or here youse a sequential files, use the OUTPUT Files which begin with 'X' are assumed to be PET ASCII files and are translated to standard ASCII prior to transmission. Conversely, if you use Easyscript, the file is in PET ASCII and needs to be translated, so you must start your file name with an 'X'.

## Programming Tips

INPUT VS GET

Have you noticed that in some programs you can answer certain questions just by pressing a single key, while in others you have to press the key plus hit the RETURN key? Have you ever wondered why?

The difference is between using INPUT in a program versus using the GET command. Briefly, the INPUT command requires you to type in your answer then input it by pressing RETURN. Your answer may be a single letter (or numeral) or a string such as a name, address, etc. With the GET command, on the other hand, the computer gets the key as soon as you press it -- you don't have to use the RETURN key. But the GET command allows only one-character answers.

Compare the following two programs. They accomplish the same thing in different ways. Note that with INPUT your answer is printed on the screen.

## INPUT

```basic
10 PRINT "LIKE YOUR COMPUTER? (Y/N)"
30 IF Y$="y" THEN PRINT "GOOD": GOTO 60
20 INPUT Y$
40 IF Y$<>"N" THEN GOTO 20
60 END
50 PRINT "WHY NOT?"
```

## GET

```basic
10 PRINT "LIKE YOUR COMPUTER? (Y/N)"
30 IF Y$="Y" THEN PRINT "GOOD": GOTO 60
20 GET Y$:IF Y$="" THEN 20
40 IF Y$<> "N" THEN GOTO 20
60 END
50 ? "WHY NOT?"
35. PRINT#15,"I", D$
```
## ENHANCEMENT TO SINGLE DISK BACK-UP

This addition to your SINGLE DISK (or 1541) BACK-UP program will allow you to either exit the program or copy another program.

Dr. Norman H. Sanders

```basic
725 bc$="Premove disk...press returnii": gosub965:Poke53272, 21
72 print" Do you want to copy another disk again? (y or n & RETURN)": Poke53272, 23
72 input d$: ifd#="y"then100: ifd‡="yes"then100: poke53272,21
728 print "Thank your for using our prosram."
729 forw=1t01000 nextw print"g' end
```
*** QUICK DISK CHECK ***

- I.S. Creasy sands the following modification to the Disk Chack program on your 1541 Iast/Damo disk. It decreases the time spent running the check to about 8 minutes, versus the provious 45 minutos. Make the following changes:
```basic
150 IF EN-O THEN 90
170 GOTO 90
200 PRINT#15, "V"D$
```

This can also be used to chock disks which have programs or data on their, but don't use it on a disk on which there are iolative files. Also, always make a backup copy of your disk prior to running this program. Another tip is 'never validate a disk that has bad. sectors. The sectors become available to the DOS again and you can lose data when you validate the next time.

## *** PROGRAMMING HINTS ***

## The following is from Bill Leary.

If you have ever had the experience of putting data in file and suddenly realize you entered the wrong thing and have already hit RETURN, you know now frustrating it can be. You often have to abort the program and start over. Prevention is best cure for. chis and here are some traps that you can put in your program to catch input errors.

- 1) A customer's number should have no more than 5 character5~

```basic
100 INPUT"CUSTOMER NUMBER": C*
120 IF LEN (C#) =0 THEN PRINT"ENTER A NUMBER": GOTO100
110 IF LEN(C$) >5 THEN PRINT'ONLY 5 DIGITS": GOTO 100
```

- 2) The customer code should be entered without any spaces in it-...

```basic
100 INPUT"CUSTOMER CODE":C$
110 FOR X=1 TO LEN(C$)
120 IF ASC(MID# (C$..1))=32 THEN PRINT"USE NO SPACES IN ENTRY": GOT 0100
130 NEXT X
```

- 3) You need an amount entered, but if the user enters a "#" or any thing other than a number, the computer (numeric variable) won't accept it----

```basic
100 INPUT " AMOUNT" :A$
110 FOR X = 1TO LEN (A$)
120IFASC(MIS#(A$,X.1) #48ANDASC(MID$(A#,X.1)<=570RASC (MID*(A$,X.1))=46THEN140
130 FRINT "ENTER NUMBERS AND DECIMAL PT. ONLY": GOTO 100
140 NEXTX
```

I frequently use the above "traps" in customized programs I write for Commodore owners who have smali or home businesses or rental property.. A tax-ready. boskkeeping system together with training starts at $25.

A menu screen is used to give a clear description and easy selection of multiple processing options in a program. For example, a word processing program may have options to Create, Save, Edit, or Print files. MENU SELECTION II is written for the C-64, but can easily be converted. Graphic symbols explanations:

Line 110-Clear Home, Reverse On, Reverse Off

Line 180-Cursor Down (3)

Lines 120-170-Cursor Down (2)

Line 999-Clear Home, Cursor Down,

Line 200 converts A$ to numeric code with ASC (A$)

Cursor Right (2)

Line 210 converts back to number, then selects subroutine

## ***FYI***

- V Your computer monitor should be compatible with your video cassette recorder - the resolution is much better!
- VA toll-free number to get a WWV time hack is 1-800-957-9999.
- VIf your power supply dies, it can be revived by the repair team of Todd Stine and Dennis Foreman for about $28. Or, you can order a new one from Commodore for about $19.95 plus shipping and 4-6 weeks.

## SUB-ROUTINES

These two short sub-routines may help you solve some programming problems.

To round off numbers to a certain number of decimal places, try this:

```
10 INPUT X 20 X= INT ((X*100)+.5)/100 30 PRINT X
```

This will round off X to two decimal places, such as dollars and cents. If you want three-decimal accuracy, change the two 100s to 1000; for four-decimal, to 10000, etc. Note that if X has fewer decimal places than you are trying to round off to, it will not add zeros. If you are working with several variables, try using the DEF FN statement:
```basic
10 20 30 INPUT B, C, D DEF FNA(Y)= INT( (X*100)+.5)/100 X=B: PRINT FNA(X) X=C: PRINT FNA (X)

- •X=D:PRINT FNA (X)
```
To right justify a column of numbers, try this:
```basic
10 INPUT X 
20 V$=STR$(X) :CT=1:TB=C 
30 IF LEN (V$)=CT THEN 50 
40 CT=CT+1:TB=TB-1: GOTO 30 
50 PRINT TAB (TB) X 
60 GOTO 10 
```
Try this, replacing C with 20

To explain the variables: X is any number; Y could be any variable which names the string made from X; CT Is used as a counter and can be any variable; IB can be any variable - it is used in backspacing from the desired column; and C can be any variable - it represents the column number in which you want the final digit to be printed.

## FUNCTION KEYS

If you've worn out the pages of your owner's manual trying to discover the secret of the FUNCTION keys, maybe this simple explanation will help. The F. keys have no particular purpose other than being another available key for you to use in programming. They are used in conjunction with the GET command. Try altering the previous GET program this way:

```basic
10 PRINT "LIKE YOUR COMPUTER?" 
15 PRINT TAB(6) "F1=YES"TAB(16) "F7=NO" 20 30 GET Y$: IF Y$="" THEN 20 IF Y$=CHR$(133) THEN PRINT "GOOD": GOTO 60 40 IF Y$<> CHR$(136) THEN GOTO 20 
50 PRINT "WHY NOT?"
60 END
```
(The CHR$ codes for "F1" and "F7" are found in the "ASCII and CHR$ CODES" Appendix.)

NOTE: If you try typing these in, don't forget to type "NEW" prior to typing in a new program.

Thanks to Brett Spivey for submitting this modification to the article about FUNCTION keys which appeared in last month's newsletter.

Instead of using the CHR$ (xxx) codes to designate the FUNCTION keys, you can use the FUNCTION key within quote marks. If you do, you'll get the following screen symbols:

F1 =

F2 =

F3 =

F4 =

F5 =

F6 =

F7 =

F8 =

Thanks to Pat Crowley for submitting this explanation as to how to better use the C-64 Wedge program on your Test/Demo disk. This supplements the info on page 14 of your disk drive user's manual.

## C-64/DOS WEDGE COMMANDS:

0 (Zero) represents Drive #

- Disk status (reads error channel)

- @$ Reads &amp; prints directory to screen/does not replace program in memory

@$0: filename

Only displays file specified

e$O: filename*

Disper ad Displays all files beginning with letters specified by filename

@$0: filename volume

Only files contained on that volume will be displayed (volume=character id)

eNO: diskname, id

Formats disk.

@RO: newfile(volume)=oldfile(volume) Renames file specified

ecO:newfile(volume)=oldfile(volume) Copies files specified by old

to name specified by new; if volume is specified, newfile will be created on that vol:

## QUIO Resets DOS

- @I Initializes disk drive

/ filename

Loads file specified. *Can only be used to load BASIC programs or machine language programs that are booted from BASIC.

*filename

Loads file specified at its own load address; same as BASIC CMD: Load "filename",8,1

+ filename

- # fflename Saves program specified by filename.

Loads and runs file specified.*

- CO Terminates wedge program

## *** SCREEN PRINT ROUTINE ***

## by Garry Wordelman

This screen print routine, which allows. screen dump to the printer: was revised from the June/July ' 83 issue of COMMODORE MAGAZINE. It is not very fast but it really works. To use it in a program, add a statement such as

## 100 GET A$: IF A$ =CHR$(133) THEN GOSUB 4100

This allows you to use the Fl function key to call the sub-routine. It is wise to use this during a time pause or after an INPUT requirement. Note that SI$(14) can be used for doublewidth characters in Line 4100. To get a normal screen print centered on your printed page, change the "00" in Lines 4280 and 4290 to "20".

## ESCAPE CHARACTER WEDGE

by Steve Scott

Have you ever had need for an "escape" key and only then noticed that your C64 doesn't have Some word processors, like Word Pro 3, or text services like Star 'Text, require the use of escape characters. The accompanying program makes this facility available to you. This is accomplished by re-defining 'F1' (chr$(133)) to escape (chr$(27)). Lines 40-70 place the wedge at $CO20. The machine language routine was placed there because insures that the wedge will not interfere with your Basic programs. Line 130 places a very small routine at $2000. This routine simply changes the hardware vector ($0314-$0315) from its usual value ($EA31) to point at the wedge ($C020). The wedge in turn jumps to the usual hardware interrupt vector. Those of you with Supermon 64 (or similar utility) may disassemble the wedge to see how it works. Once the program is run, typing 'Fl' will output an escape character. The re-definition will remain in effect until a Control Z or the Run/Stop-Restore sequence is entered.

## *** EASY SAVE C-64 DOS WEDGE ***

## by Leroy Baker

This program can be saved as a basic program, yet contains the WEDGE in machine language. The 1541 WEDGE is located between the of the basic program and the start of the variables. 'DOS top

1. Type in the following program:
```basic
10 ML=PEEK (45) +256*PEEK (46)-859: SY 52224
12 IF A=O THEN A=1: LOAD "DOS 5.1", 8, 1
20 FOR I=0 TO 858: POKESY+I, PEEK (ML +L) : NEXT
15 FOR I=0 TO 858: PDKEML+I, PEEK (SY+I) : NEXT
30 SYSSY
40 END
```
2. Insert the TEST/DEMO disk with the DOS 5.1 and run the program. you use the DISK BONUS PACK, change the title in line 12 "DOS WEDGE".
3. Delete Lines 12 and 15 (ie, "12 &lt;RETURN›",
4. Change Line 40 from "END" to "NEW".
5. List the program. It should look like this:
```BASIC
10 ML=PEEK (45) +256*PEEK (46) -859:SY=52224
30 SYSSY
20 FOR I=0 TO 858: POKE (SY+I) , PEEK (ML+I) : NEXT
40 NEW
```
6. SAVE on the desired disk using the abbreviated command, "EDOS".
2. LOAD the program by typing in LOAD "DUS",8. Once loaded, it can be saved by SAVE "DOS", 8 before it is run. Once it is run it removed by the NEW command in Line 40.

***COPYING THE C64 DØS WEDGE*** (From the June issue of COMPUTE! magazine) You may copy this handy program to any of your diskettes with the aid of a machine language monitor now available from the Club Library: SUPERMON-64. Here is the procedure: 1. LOAD and RUN the SUPERMON-64 program. 2. Within the monitor, load the DOS 5.1 program into memory by entering L"DOS 5.1" ,08. '3. You may now save the wedge into any diskette by entering S"DOS 5.1",08, CCØØ, CF5A. 4. Exit the monitor by entering X. To Toad the wedge, enter
```basic
 LOAD"DOS 5.1",8,1. 
 ```
 To enable the wedge, enter SYS52224. Bruce Nelson MENU SELECTION ROUTINE

Several People have expressed exasperation about storing ieving data with their disk drive. I hope I can provide some help. not an expert - some of my techniques can certainly improved But the way I use the disk in this sample program is the same used in my HOME INVENTORY program and it works. Some of specifica I don't understand, but I don't care 15 long 13 I can do I need to do. If you are a novice, use this program 3s example. Plug in your oun variables and file names and try to write your oun program.

The first commanda will work: thing to remember is to format your diskette. These

OPEN1.8,15 CRETURNO

PRINT#1, "N@ diskname,01" CRETURN?

After your disk drive stops running, fit should've made a clicking first› type in ```LOAD "$",9 CRETURN?``` · then ```LIST```. If 3 OU were successful you'll see the disk directory CoME uP with your diskname and "664 BLOCKS FREE". An essier way to format is with the (available from club members) or with the 1541 Back-uP

your disk will store two different types of files - Program and sequential. A Program file is simply a program, a set of numbered commands which allow you to "do" something. A sequential file relative or random, 1s you learn more) contains data items ot information which you want to save so you can recall them later.

Let's say you want to keep track of the sales yOU P39 Purchases. Program file will be the set of commands listed below. Your sequential file will include the data you enter, ie amount: tax, etc. Here's how the flow goes. The first tine the program you enter all the data you want to save. When you're through. you "write" the data with the ```PRINT#``` command to the disk. you have your sequential file. Later one when you retrieve the data, you "read" the data with the ```INPUT#``` command the computer memory from the disk.

Of course, the actual commands are 3 little more complicated. you can write or read to 4 file, that file must be opened. And before that file can be opened, the command channel has to be opened. Here a the sequence and the format. Variables are underlined, meaning you car use your own numbers or names.
```basic
OPEN15,9,15, "IO"
OPEN2, 9,2: "e0 name 3,H"
PRINT#2 BE B
CLOSE2 OPEN2, 8,2: "9: namg, S,P"
INPUT#2, AS.A
CLOSE CLOSE 15
```
opens command channeli Copens channel 2 writing to sequential file "name") {writes the data in variables At and A to the file opened in channel 27 ¿closes the file opened in channel2 Copers channel 2 for reading sequential file named "name" treads the data in variables Af and A from the file opened in channel 23 (closes file) ¿closes command channel)

The following program is intended to be used more as a Programming example rather than a useful program. It will show you how to: store and retrieve data. Some notes:

1. The sub-routine at line 900 performs a disk check.
3. The heart-shaped symbol in lives 50 and 100 is the shirted CLR HOME.
2. All of the di symbols, such as in line 50, are cursor down symbols.
4. Line 95 is a short-cut way to avoid using IF-THEN statements.
5. When you have no mone data to enter, enter "B" as the date cline
5. Line 100 limita the numbers of entries to 209.
7. In line 165, the sumbol inside the quotes is the CBM £ keys.
9. Line 200. The """ symbol allows you to alter the contents.
9. Lines 210,230. It's better to use the CHR$:13) rather comma to separate the data items.

Finalls, several of the VIC People comf 1911e0 rost of the articles in the neusletter were for the 64.
