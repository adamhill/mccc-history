Some of specifica 1 don't understand, but I don't care as long as I can need to are a novice: this program as example. Plug in your own variables and file names and try to write sour own Program.

The First thing to remember is to format your diskette. These commands will work:
```basic 
OPEN1.8.15 <RETURN>
PRINT#1. "NO: diskname, 01" <RETURN>
```

After your disk drive stope ruming. Cit should've made a clicking at first; type in ```LOAD "#",8``` successful 9ou'll <RETURN>? · then ```LIST```. It you see the disk directora coMe UP with your disknane and ```664 BLOCKS FREE``` An easier was to format is with the (available from club members) or with the 1541 Backup Single Disk cof program.
