**** APRIL 1983

## PRESIDENT'S NOTES

I am absolutely amazed at the overwhelming support and participation of our members. Many people have expressed a desire to help or offer their talents and services.. have 97 paid members as of the March meeting and we are still growing.

Our list of possible member discounts is growing, but we are still waiting for written confirmation on most of them. We have contacted several stores in and around the Northeast Mall area. If you want us to contact stores in other areas, such as Arlington or Forth worth, write down the name and complete mailing address of the store along with "Request for Store Discount" and we will gladly contact them.

We have purchased several dozen disks to start making copies of our two-volume donation of Commodore's Public Domain educational software (about 650 plus programs). Many thanks to Taylor Computer Systems for this set.

A special note of good news...1 read an article in the March/April issue of Commander concerning the production of a voice-synthesizer for the C-64. It uses the 'SAY' command and verbalizes the words in quotes (like print statements) to be spoken. The price is expected to be under $100 and it is scheduled to be released this Spring.

I need to make one last note concerning our May meeting. Due to increased members and interested people, we will be moving to the Hurst Recreation Center on Mary Drive. This will start after our April meeting at the Hurst Public Library. I hope this will be a more permanent meeting place. A map will e included in next month's newsletter and directions will be available at the April 16 meeting.

Thank you all for your support of me and our great club.

Garry Wordelman

## Previous Month's Minutes

The second monthly meeting was called to order by acting President Garry wordelman on 19 March 1983 at the Hurst Public Library. Acting Secretary/ Treasurer Bruce Nelson read the minutes from the February meeting, which send the mites on e were approved by the members. Bruce reported that, prior to the meeting, the club had received $495 in membership fees, spent $107,, to leave a balance of $388 in the Treasury.

Garry presided over a discussion of the proposed Articles of Constitution for the Mid-Cities Commodore Computer Club. Two items discussed were that the Treasurer should report to the membership at each meeting and that the meetings should be conducted following Robert's Rules of Order. With these additions, the constitution was unanimously approved by the membership.

Mike Taylor, of Taylor Computing Systems, presented to the club the collection of public domain software from Commodore. The collection of forty-five diskettes will be made available to the membership after back-up copies have been made and a check-out procedure established by the Executive Committee. The membership then approved, as required by the Constitution, the purchase of fifty diskettes on which to copy the public domain software. Garry notified the membership that he planned to purchase the diskettes from Taylor's in appreciation of their donation to the club. He emphasized that this was a one-time-only purchase from Taylor's, and that the club's purchasing policy would continue to be to find the best possible deal. He also mentioned that there will be club membership ID cards made as soon as the Executive Committee decides on a style and has them printed. The cards will be especially useful in order to obtain club discounts at various computer businesses. These discounts are currently being negotiated. The club is also investigating the advantages to incorporating.

Jim Jones presented an MCCC cap to Garry. Jim will sell the caps to club members for $3.50.

Several members expressed an interest in establishing a modem group. George Crowley volunteered to be the modem group leader. His phone number is 283-0516.

The next meeting will be 16 April at 1:30 at the Hurst Library. Taylor's will demonstrate the new P128 computer and permanent officers will be elected. The proposed slate of officers is:

President Vice President Secretary Treasurer Activity Chairman Newsletter Editor Librarian

Garry Wordelman Gary Stallcup Ken Widner Bruce Nelson Brett Spivey Steve Stockdale David Sunkel

The business meeting then adjourned for question/answer and software exchange.

## SUB-ROUTINES

These two short sub-routines may help you solve some programming problems.

To round off numbers to a certain number of decimal places, try this:

```basic
10 INPUT X
20 X=INT((X*100)+.5)/100 :
30 PRINT X
```

This will round off X to two decimal places, such as dollars and cents. If you want three-decimal accuracy, change the two 100s to 1000; for four-decimal, to 10000, etc. Note that if X has fewer decimal places than you are trying to round off to, it will not add zeros. If you are working with several variables, try using the DEF FN statement:

```basic
10 INPUT B, C, D
20 DEF FNA(Y)=INT ((X*100)+.5)/100
30 X=B: PRINT FNA (X)
40 X=C: PRINT FNA (X)
50 X=D:PRINT FNA (X)
```

To right justify a column of numbers, try this:

```basic
10 INPUT X
20 V$=STR$(X): CT=1: TB=C
30 IF LEN(V$)=CT THEN 50
40 CT=CT+1: TB=TB-1: GOTO 30
50 PRINT TAB (TB)X
60 GOTO 10
```

To explain the variables: X is any number; V could be any variable which names he string made from X; CT is used as a counter and can be any variable; IB ca e any variable - it is used in backspacing from the desired column: and C ca be any variable - it represents the column number in which you want the final digit to be printed.

## FUNCTION KEYS

If you've worn out the pages of your owner's manual trying to discover the = secret of the FUNCTION keys, maybe this simple explanation will help. The i evs have no particular purpose other than being another available key for you to use in programming. They are used in conjunction with the GET command. Try altering the previous GET program this way:

```basic
PRINT "LIKE YOUR COMPUTER?"
GET Y$: IF Y$="" THEN 20
PRINT TAB (6) "F1=YES"TAB (16) "F7=NO"
30 IF Y$=CHR$(133) THEN PRINT "GOOD": GOTO 60
40 IF Y$<> CHR$(136) THEN GOTO 20
50 PRINT "WHY NOT?"
60 END
```

(The CHR$ codes for "F1" and "F7" are found in the "ASCII and CHR$ CODES" Appendix.)

NOTE: If you try typing these in, don't forget to type "NEW" prior to typing in a new program.

Try this, replacing C with 20

INPUT VS GET

Have you noticed that in some programs you can answer certain questions just by pressing a single key, while in others you have to press the key plus hit the RETURN key? Have you ever wondered why?

The difference is between using INPUT in a program versus using the GET command. Briefly, the INPUT command requires you to type in your answer then input it by pressing RETURN. Your answer may be a single letter (or numeral) or a string such as a name, address, etc. With the GET command, on the other hand, the computer gets the key as soon as you press it -- you don't have to use the RETURN key. But the GET command allows only one-character answers.

Compare the following two programs. They accomplish the same thing in different ways. Note that with INPUT your answer is printed on the screén.

## INPUT

```basic
10 PRINT "LIKE YOUR COMPUTER? (Y/N) "
20 INPUT Y$
30 IF Y$="y" THEN PRINT "GOOD": GOTO 60
40 IF Y$<>"N" THEN GOTO 20
50 PRINT "WHY NOT?"
60 END
```

## GET

```basic
20 GET Y$: IF Y$="'" THEN 20
40 IF Y$<> "N" THEN GOTO 20
50 ? "WHY NOT?"
60 END
```

(LINE 40 ENSURES THAT ONLY A "Y" OR A "N" WILL BE ACCEPTED AS A VALID ANSWER)

****REMINDER****

If you haven't paid your club dues, note that this will be the last newsletter you Will receive. Also note that you won't have proof of membership in order to qualify for hardware and software discounts. Also note that you won't be able to copy club library programs.

so -- note that dues for 1983 pala in April will be $13.50. See, call, or write Bruce Nelson, 2152 Hurstview Drive, Hurst, Texas 76053, 498-0899.

**** HELP ****

We need some help from you VIC-20 folks specifically, someone to bring computers to the meetings and items of interest concerning the VIC-20 for this newsletter. Contact B1l1 Aiken (292-2087), Bobby Richards (496-0283), or Brett Spivey (281-8100).

Also, you folks with modems might be thinking about using the STAR-TEXT bulletin board for club notices, etc. Maybe we could develop our own MCCC bulletin board. Any ideas?

*** FYI ***

If you have a C-64 that does not have the rainbow color bars on the keyboard, you have an "older" machine. The significance of this (besides the fact you probably paid $200 more for it), is that there is a minor difference in the kernal. It is possible that with the older machine and with certain programs, some characters may be printed in the same color as the background -- you won't see them! This "blanking" may be resolved by a machine-code software patch (on tape or disk). Check with your dealer to see if he has it.

On a related matter, several of you may have problems with the screen "flickering" while in a GET loop or a time delay loop. If so, this may be caused by the same thing. Anybody know about this?

## $$$ DISCOUNTS $$$

RAVE has announced that they will, give club members a 10% discount on hardware and software which is not already on sale. Most of RAVE's stuff is already discounted, so be advised. ,Be sure to carry your club dues receipt (until ID cards are available) in order to provide proof of membership.
