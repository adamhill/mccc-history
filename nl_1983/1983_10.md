## *** PRESIDENT'S NOTES ***

We've had a favorable response to our mini-course presentations at last month's meeting. Some people even wanted to attend more than the two that were available. We hope to repeat this type of program early next year. I want to thank those members who volunteered their time and talents in preparing the programs and also to you who helped set up and clean up the meeting \_room.

Our program October 8th will be a presentation on "Using General Ledger (C-64)" by Dr. Norman Sanders. He suggests that you bring a pencil and paper for taking notes.

There will be an Executive Meeting at my house on Saturday, November 5th at 10:00. All officers, chairmen and leaders are urged to attend.

See you at the meeting this weekend.

Garry

## *** PLEASE NOTE ***

As a first step in forming various chapters of the MCCC for 1984, there will be sign-up sheets at this Saturday's meeting for indicating your area of town. There will be a list for each of the following malls: Ridgmar, Hulen, Northeast, Six Flags and one for TCJC South Campus. Sign up on the list for the place nearest your home. The malls aren't going to be meeting places - just landmarks we use to divide up the area. If you won't be at the meeting this week, call Ken Widner at 924-8948. He'll see that your name gets placed on the list. Also, organizers will be needed for each area. These areas haven't been defined yet, either by number or geographic boundaries. More information will be presented at the meeting Saturday.

## *** QUICK DISK CHECK ***

- T.s. Creasy sends the following modification to the Disk Check program on your 1541 Test/Demo disk. It decreases the time spent running the check to about 8 minutes, versus the previous 45 minutes.

Make the following changes:

```basic
35 PRINT#15, "I", D$
150 IF EN=0 THEN 90
170 GOTO 90
200 PRINT#15, "V"D$
```

This can also be used to check disks which have programs or data on them, but don't use it on a disk on which there are relative files. Also, always make a backup copy of your disk prior to running this program. Another tip sectors. The sectors become available to the DOS again and you can lose data when you validate the next time.

## *** PROGRAMMING HINTS ***

## The following is from Bill Leary.

If you have ever had the experience of pütting data in file and suddenly realize you entered the wrong thing and have already hit RETURN, you know now frustrating it can be. You often have co abort the program and start over" Prevention is best cure for and here some traps that you can put in your progran to catch

- 1) A customer"s number should have no more than 5 characters

```basic
100 INPUT "CUSTOMER NUMBER"; C$
110 IF LEN(C*)05 THEN PRINT'ONLY S DIGITS": GOTO 100
120 IF LEN (C#) =O THEN PRINT"ENTER A · NUMBER": GOTO100
```

- 2) The customer code should be entered without any spaces in

```basic
100 INPUT "CUSTOMER CODE"; C$
110 FOR X=1 TO LEN(C$)
120 IF ASC(MID# (C*, X, 1)) =32 THEN PRINT"USE NO SPACES IN ENTRY": GOT 0100
130 NEXT X
```

an amount entered, but it the user enters a "3" 0r number, the computer (numeric veriable) any thing other than a won't accept it-
```basic
100 INPUT"AMOUNT" *A$

110 FOR X = 1TO LEN(A#)

130 PRINT "ENTER NUMBERS AND DECIMAL PT. ONLY": GOTO 100 140 NEXTX

1201FASC (MIS$(A*, X. 1) 48ANDASC (MID$ (As, X" 1) &lt;=570RASC(MID$ (A#, X, 1) )=46THEN140
```
I frequently use the above "traps" in customized programs I write for Commodore owners who have small or home businesses rental property. A tax ready bookkeeping system together with training starts at $25.

```basic

This is a program which will balance your checkbook for you, after you've compared your monthly bank statement to your checkbook and noted which checks deposits cleared. be fairly self-explanatory, but if you have any questions about it, I'll be happy to answer them at the meeting. (This was typed just before the deadline - the editor does not guarantee there aren't typos.)
