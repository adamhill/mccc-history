*** JUNE 1983

MCCC NEWS

## ***PRESIDENT'S NOTES***

I'd like to welcome all of you new members. As of June 4, we have 124 C64 members, 56 VIC, and 3 PET for a total membership of 183.

One step which we must take is to more formally structure our meetings in order to avoid the seeming chaos at last month's meeting. To this end, please note the folTowing rules and agenda for the June 18th meeting:

It is evident that we are experiencing some growing pains. Al though we had hoped that we would have a permanent "home" at the Hurst Rec Center, we may have to look elsewhere if we continue this rapid growth.

1. All machines should be left OFF until the software demonstration/exchange period.
2. The first hour will consist of the business meeting, program, and questions pertaining to these two topics only.
3. The next thirty minutes will consist of the 64 and VIC individual group meetings with the Group Leaders presiding. this time, they will answer written questions which you will have been given an opportunity to write, as well as announcing what programs are available for copying.
4. After this Q &amp; A period, the informal discussion and exchange will take place. PLEASE try to keep the noise level down! Your courtesy will be appreciated (and, we hope, reciprocated) by all.

At the June 4 executive meeting, the following expenditures were approved: $30 to purchase the VIC-20 public domain volumes; $45 to purchase miscellaneous supplies pertaining to the newsletter; and the funds necessary to publish new directories and publish and mail the newsletter.

Many thanks to the following volunteers: Ken Westbrook-VIC 20 group leader; Diane Dews-C64 group leader; and Joe Kent-Education note that this month's program deals with "Screen Format and File Processing for Business Applications" by Henry Zaehringer. Henry is Bell Helicopter's Educational Coordinator. It should be a great meeting -- hope to see you there.

## ***MAY MINUTES***

The May 21, 1983 meeting was called to order by Garry Wordelman. Minutes of the April meeting were read by Secretary Ken Widner. Treasurer Bruce Nelson reported the club's finances and membership status - 97 C64, 48 VIC, and 3 PET. David Sunkel announced that up to 3 library disks may be mailed in one mailer. Steve Stockdale asked for comments on the newsletter - the response was favorable - and encouraged people to contribute.

Garry announced that Taylor Computers was selling out all VIC software at 50% off. He also reported that expenses to incorporate may be prohibitive.

Ken Westbrook was named as the new VIC-20 group leader. Twenty-two members expressed an interest in Ham Radio.

Todd Stine and Dennis Foreman of Metroplex : Computers presented the program, discussing repair of Commodore hardware.

Joe Kent volunteered to become the Education Chairman and set up a course in BASIC.

Some monitor problems were discussed among i the members, the most significant being that with the new Commodore monitor, the rear plugin provides greater resolution than the front plug-in.

The meeting adjourned to informal chaos and software exchange.

## ESCAPE CHARACTER WEDGE

## by Steve Scott

Have you ever had need for an "escape" key and only then noticed that your C64 doesn't have one? Some word processors, like Word Pro 3, or text services like Star Text, require the use of escape characters. The accompanying program makes this facility available to you. This is accomplished by re-defining `'F1' (chr$(133))` to escape `(chr$(27))`. Lines 40-70 place the wedge at `$C020`. The machine language routine was placed there because `$C000-$CFFF` is protected from BASIC. insures that the wedge will not interfere with your Basic programs. Line 130 places a very small routine at $2000. This routine simply changes the hardware vector `($0314-$0315)` from its usual value `($EA31)` to point at the wedge `($C020)`. The wedge in turn jumps to the usual hardware interrupt vector. Those of you with Supermon 64 (or similar utility) may disassemble the wedge to see how it works. Once the program is run, typing 'Fl' will output an escape character. The re-definition will remain in effect until a Control Z or the Run/Stop-Restore sequence is entered.

## ***BRAINSTORMING***

(or, "Idle Thoughts I've Had While Contemplating Syntax Errors")

How about if the club provided an incentive for people to type up the programs listed in magazines such as COMPUTE, COMMANDER, etc.? Say a certain amount per line, or 10 lines, to the first person to mail a diskette to the librarian with a correctly entered program?

Is the timing right for the newsletter? Would you rather receive it sooner, or later? What about passing it out at the meeting, instead of mailing it?

## ***LOOKING AHEAD***

## JUNE MEETING

- There will be a sign-up sheet for a BASIC course for beginners. See Joe Kent.
- Questions for group leaders will be written. Have your questions ready when you come. You'll be given a chance to write them down during the meeting, or do it prior.
- VYou'll be asked to complete a survey. Think about what your current interests are, what your future interests might be, and what you really want out of the club.
- VIf you've written software or have public domain programs, please bring them to trade. REMEMBER-No copyrighted programs are to be copied during any meeting!
- V Several amendments to the Constitution will be discussed.
- VWe have over $1800 in the bank. We'll discuss buying some software for the library which may be loaned out to club members.

## JULY MEETING

- VA printer demo is planned. If you have one and can bring it, please contact one of the group leaders.
- V Pat McCoy will demonstrate the Word Pro 3 word processing program. If anyone wishes to demonstrate another package, contact Garry.

***COPYING THE C64 DØS WEDGE*** (From the June issue of COMPUTE! magazine)

You may copy this handy program to any of your diskettes with the aid of a machine language monitor now available from the Club Library: SUPERMON-64. Here is the procedure:

1. `LOAD` and `RUN` the `SUPERMON-64` program.
3. You may now save the wedge into any diskette by entering `S"DOS 5.1", 08, CCØØ, CF5A`.
2. Within the monitor, load the DOS 5.1 program into memory by entering `L"DOS 5.1", 08`.
4. Exit the monitor by entering X.

To load the wedge, enter `LOAD"DOS 5.1",8, 1`. To enable the wedge, enter `SYS 52224`.
