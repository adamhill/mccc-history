I must congratulate Steve Stockdale for a great first edition of our newsletter last I think we picked a fine editor and I'm looking forward to many more outstanding editions.

Special thanks to Bruce Nelson for his super work as both Secretary and Treasurer for the first three months. Our club would not have made it this far without his help and support.

*** VIC-20 USERS ***

Ken Westbrook reports two good deals you should check into. The first is a 3-volume set of programs from PUBLIC DOMAIN, INC. Each volume costs $10, contains about 73 programs on two cassettes (diskettes available), and, according to Ken, is well worth the money.

The second is the opportunity for anyone who is a subscriber to JOURNAL 20, a bi-weekly newsletter, by May 30 to purchase a 16K memory expansion for $44 or the Cardboard/3s VIC Expansion Motherboard for $24. Both are built by CARDCO, are warranted, and come with 45-page manuals. Thanks, Ken!
