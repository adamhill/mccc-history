## 24-bit Graphics

A comparison of the available products by Johnny C. Kitchens robably the most heard number going around the Amiga circles today has to be 24. In this case it's the number of bit planes for 16,777,216 colors. There appears to be a mad rush to come out with a 24-bit video something for the Amiga, and a mad rush to get one. Many people are starting to wonder which to get and what has what. To make things more confusing the ads seem to be a bit cryptic in giving useful information. Probably the worst problem some have begun to notice is the lack of compatibility. Images from one system may not work with another. An IFF standard and programs like The

Art Department will provide some relief, but buying one of these systems may lock you into a format that is incompatible with some other system.

DCTV appears to be capable at first glance, but when you check the specs we see a very low bandwidth - it's about 3mhz. FireCracker garnered a "yes" - though it to is a bit would be obvious to anyone looking. Do you want to digitize? DCTV can do it but not in real time. Most of the others do not. How about animation? ColorBurst says full screen 24 bit at 20 frames per second and 8 bit full screen at 60 frames per second. ColorBurst was the only

I've put together a comparison chart for you to look at, and hopefully it will be of some help. Please don't consider it absolutely correct. Specs can change or my interpretation of the facts may be wrong. You may want to check out things for yourself, in which case if you share your findings with us all we will all benefit.

As I put together this comparison I came across many conflicts in information. Some of the points I had to determine based on the information presented to me. An example is the "Broadcast Quality Video" comparison.

curious, that's 4,294,967,296 colors to play with. When the new stuff arrives you can at least have something to compare with. Enjoy the comparison table...

low on its bandwidth, it's close enough. I decided not to include a few things in the comparison, since I felt they one to have that information. As you may have noticed, ColorBurst makes a rather impressive showing for itself, but does it have everything you need? More important is the fact that it is not available yet - at least not here in the United States. It is shipping everywhere else. I called M.A.S.T. and they told me that it would ColorBurst hopefully be ready in a month. One mail-order company now lists it in their ads. ColorBurst isn't the only one due out soon. The Lowell card from Commodore itself is due soon - as is a card from GVP. If 24 bit is too limiting for you, then consider that a 32 bit card may be here in the near future. If you're

## Accessorize!

Improving your GEOS system by Foster McCowan he whole purpose of an operating system is to be ability to control computer functions and manipulate data so that all of its compatible programs perform as they should. It would be downright redundant to have to enter code or cryptic commands to control every activity of all the Geos programs that one is apt to utilize when word processing or creating graphics, or heaven forbid - desktop publishing. The key to being able to control these functions in an operating system like Geos, is its user interface. Geos's interface or shell, if you will, is called the "desktop". From this user interface every Geos program is launched, landed, created, deleted, merged and manipulated in some way, shape, form or manner. All programs are not created equally. Frankly, for a Geos user, there are few things as frustrating as having to close a program in order to open another program to perform a simple task. I mean, seriously, computing would become an arduous task if every time you wanted to import an photo scrap into GeoPaint, you were forced to close the program and go to the desktop to access the Photo Manager. The Photo Manager, like some other utility-type programs, is accessed by the use of a pull-down menu, and is available while in GeoWrite, GeoPaint, GeoPublish as well as other applications. Programs that make use of entry through the "gate" of a pull-down menu are called a "Desk Accessories" (DA's). True to their literal sense, these DA's are accessories that can be enabled without having to exit a program, the ability to access them is through the clicking of a pulldown menu. Several programs on the system disks calculator, notepad and the above mentioned Photo Manager are desk accessories and are conveniently accessed in this manner. One of the first add-on disks released by Berkeley Softworks was Desk Pack 1, which was overhauled and is now called Desk Pack Plus. Desk Pack Plus contains a stalwart lineup of DA's, most of which can become part of your everyday computing. There are six of them.

## Calendar

This DA is the least discussed, but one of the most useful of all the programs created by Berkeley. When active, each day's box on the screen is an active "button"; click on one, and a Calendar "memo pad" opens up, ready · and waiting for entering important data for meeting, memory joggers, or other significant times that may otherwise end up on a Post-It note or scrap of paper. The "?" icon shows every date (in the year) that holds information, and clicking on a date also calls up that day's memo pad. Select "copy" from its Command Bar and the present screen calendar dumps to a photo scrap. Text scraps can be cut, copied, or pasted from/to Calendar "notepad" pages. When these features are used in combination, little effort produces a complete monthly date keeper.

## GeoDex

Simply a powerful, "Rolodex" style DA database program which easily "flips" through a pre-designed database of name, address, phone, and personal information. Features: Phone dialer; printing features: spaced mailing labels, phone lists, or print field data; it has the ability to create GeoMerge information files; a "lasso" feature provides for "Group" specific search and merge file creation; and a whole lot of other features. Warning: GeoDex will not, nor does it pretend to replace the much more powerful GeoFile. Still, GeoDex can be handy for quick storage, retrieval and transfer of file information without leaving the program you're working in.

## GeoMerge

A mail merge utility with "if" and "if - else" conditional merge abilities. A powerful feature whose worth is self explanatory.

## Icon Editor

Does more than edit icons. Geos users can "cut and paste" their own designs from GeoPaint, and further edit them in the Icon Editor window. Icon Editor imports nonGeos data files into Geos and allows users to select special file types, a must for programmers.

## Graphics Grabber

If you use Print Shop, PrintMaster or NewsRoom clipart, Graphics Grabber easily moves them into Geos for use in "Write", "Paint", etc. Some features: Choose from or create albums to place converted graphics; page through images before converting. For large scale transfer of original graphics disks, Graphics Grabber is a must. With this and other public domain converters, nearly every image ever created on a Commodore computer can be ported to Geos.

## Blackjack

If you can play "21" and "blackjack", then you know what this program is all about. Has nice sound (of dealer shuffling etc.) and sharp graphics.

Conclusion: Is Desk Pack Plus worth it? You'd better believe it. This program-rich disk can be had for $14.95 direct from Berkeley Softworks. To order, please refer to earlier issues in which the procedure was detailed.

## Computer Languages

Which language is right for you? Author Unknown n order to help you make a competent, uncomplicated choice concerning the competition between complex, incompatible computer compilers, we have composed this complete, compact, composite compendium comprising comparisons to compensate for the complaints and complements of their compromises. We hope you find it comprehensible rather than compost.

ASSEMBLER: You shoot yourself in the foot.

ADA: The Department of Defense shoots you in the foot after offering you a blindfold and a last cigarette.

APL: GN ? FT ^ BLT

BASIC [interpreted): You shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol until your leg is waterlogged and rots off.

BASIC (compiled): You shoot yourself in the foot with a BB using a SCUD missile launcher.

C+ +: You create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot them all in the foot. Not knowing which feet are virtual, medical care is impossible.

COBOL: USE HANDGUN.COLT|45] AIM AT LEG.FOOT. THEN WITH ARM.HAND.FINGER ON HANDGUN.COLTITRIGGER] PERFORM SQUEEZE. RETURN HANDGUN.COLT TO HIP.HOLSTER.

CSH: After searching the manual until your foot falls asleep, you shoot the computer and switch to C.

dBase: You buy a gun. Bullets are only available from another company and are promised to work so you buy them. Then you find out that the next version of the gun is the one that is scheduled to actually shoot bullets.

FORTRAN: You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out of toes. You shoot the 6th bullet anyway since no exception-processing was anticipated.

MODULA-2: You perform a shooting on what might be currently a foot with what might be currently a bullet shot by what might currently be a gun.

PASCAL: Same as Modula-2 except the bullet is not of the right type for the gun and your hand is blown off.

PL/1: After consuming all systern resources including bullets, the data processing department doubles it's size, acquires 2 new mainframes and drops the original on your foot.

SMALLTALK, ACTOR:, et al: After playing with the graphics for 3 weeks the programming manager shoots you in the head.

SNOBOL: Grab your foot with your hand and rewrite your hand to be a bullet.

## Welcome Dealers

I am pleased to welcome two new local Amiga dealers to the area and to these pages. I wish the best of luck them and to ALL our local dealers. May they all sell many Amiga systems and keep the Amiga strong. ...Bill Raecke

## Understanding Your AMIGA

File handling from the Workbench by Harold Williams he Amiga Workbench is designed to simplify the and deleting objects. These tasks are accomplished primarily through the use of the Amiga's mouse driven point and click interface. The keyboard is only required when renaming a file.

The copy procedure is the same as the move procedure. This can cause some confusion. The technique is simple... locate the tool, project or drawer that you wish to copy then drag it to the drawer or disk where you want to place the copy. The destination disk or drawer does not have to be open. If the destination disk or drawer is open the object can be placed in the open window. The confusing aspect of this procedure is determining whether or not a move or copy will take place. Workbench will do a move if the source and destination volumes are the same (think of a volume as being a device, like the floppy drive). If the source and destination volumes are different then Workbench will perform a copy. This rule can be easily demonstrated using a copy of your Workbench disk and the Amiga's RAM device. Place a copy of Workbench in drive DFO:. Open the Workbench window, and then open the Utilities drawer. Grab the Clock icon and drag it to the System drawer. The Clock icon will disappear from the Utilities drawer and will be found in the System drawer. This was a move operation because both drawers exist on the same device. Now use the same procedure to move the Clock program back to the Utilities drawer. Grab the Clock icon again and drag it to the RAM disk icon. The Clock program will still be in the Workbench Utility drawer and you will also find it in the RAM disk. This was a copy because the original Clock program was on the volume in DFO: and the destination was the RAM disk volume. One problem with the move operation is that it is too easy! It is common for new Amiga users to unintentionally initiate a move by dropping an icon on a closed drawer.

Workbench 1.3 has an interesting bug involving the move operation. WARNING! Do not try this with a disk that contains valuable data. If you must see this bug use a disk that you are prepared to re-initialize. Here's the bug... If you have a drawer named Drawerl and inside it is another drawer named Drawer2, Workbench will allow you to move Drawerl inside Drawer2. The result is that both drawers will disappear! All of the programs and data will also be gone. If this does happen to you (what were you thinking about?) there is a glimmer of hope to recover your files. I have used Dave Haynie's DiskSalv utility

![Image](1991_08_artifacts/image_000010_25fd52508bf7b8bd2ae73efbd8d4f5fa1a5d81305526f5b9d62b30f2081e1353.png)

(available from the MCCC library and the MCCC BBS) to successfully recover the lost data. DiskSalu always gurued at the end of the recovery, but the data was recovered. The disk where this problem occurred will still be corrupted although usable. It is best to recover the data and then re-initialize the corrupted disk.

The Rename operation will open a string gadget and request a new name. Renaming an object that was just created using the duplicate feature can present a couple of problems. First, you cannot rename the object to the same name as the original object unless you have moved the newly created copy to another window. Workbench will not allow two objects in the same window to have exactly the same name. Secondly, if you have moved the object to a new window and now wish to restore the original name be sure you delete the space that occurs between "copy of" and the original name. Some objects require that they have the correct name. If you leave the space at the beginning of the name it will look correct to you, but your Amiga will still see the space.

Duplicating, renaming and deleting operations are all handled with Workbench menu items. All of these operations require that you first select the icon then choose the appropriate menu item. Choosing Duplicate from the Workbench menu will create an exact copy of the selected item with the words "copy of" prefixing the original name. If you duplicate an object that already has the "copy of" prefix, Workbench will begin number the copies using the prefix "copy 2 of". The copy will be created in the same drawer as the original object.

The Delete operation is named "Discard" on the Workbench menu. When you choose discard a requester will appear with a warning. You can choose to continue with the discard operation or cancel it. Objects that are deleted can be recovered with the DiskSalv utility, but only if it is used immediately. Workbench provides a second method of deleting objects. The Amiga Trashcan is a special drawer that can be used to hold files that are no longer needed. Under the Disk menu heading is an item named "Empty Trash". If the Trashcan is selected, and "Empty Trash" is selected all of the objects currently in the Trashcan are deleted. Workbench does not provide a requester for this operation. I recommend a careful examination of the contents of the Trashcan before using this procedure.

There is a simple way to avoid accidentally deleting objects. Select the object you wish to protect from deletion, then select the Workbench menu item named

## The Bodega Bay

Hands-on review by Dan Reilly From the newsletter of the Glendale, Arizona User Group his looks to be one of the hottest products released (thanks to Jay Horak at Copperstate) to test-drive the first of these babies to arrive in the state. And boy, did I enjoy the trip! The first thing I noticed about the Ding t noted about one Bodega Bay was its size. It is big. It has to be. It can fit four expansion cards (Three of which may be IBM), two floppy disk drives (5.25, or with an adaptor, 3.5), a 3.5 hard drive, and a floppy disk controller. There are also plans to produce models with more slots!

Setup is simple. Take your normal A500 power supply and put it away. The Bodega Bay has a 200-watt power supply so it can even supply power to your monitor if you want it to. There is a power cable that you plug into the back of your A500, then into the back of the Bodega Bay. All the other cables stay plugged into the back of your A500. Since the "frame" of the Bodega Bay encloses most of your A500, these cables should all be secure before you try to connect your A500 and the Bodega Bay. Trying to access them after you connect the unit is not a pleasant task, and California Access does not recommend it. Neither do I, for that matter. To get to the back of your A500 you might as well make sure that power is off and just separate the units, then you can get to the connections in the back of your A500 easily.

Notice I have not mentioned the use of any tools yet. That's because you don't need any. Your A500 just slides into the "foot" of the Bodega Bay (to connect your left expansion port) and rests almost under the unit. The upper surface of the Bodega Bay is eminently suitable for a monitor to sit on, and the casing is colored to match you A500 like a factory unit.

Well, that was easy enough to do, but the real point of getting a Bodega Bay is so you can put expansion cards in it. This is a more technically demanding job and requires the use of... a phillips-head screwdriver. No, really, that's the only tool you need to install stuff inside your Bodega Bay (actually, you can use a swiss-army knife too). There

"Info". The Info screen will include a box labeled "Status". In the Status box there is an area that, when clicked on, will toggle between "DELETEABLE" and "NOT DELETEABLE". Selecting "NOT DELETEABLE" and then using the save option to exit the Info screen will make the object safe from both of the Workbench delete features.

are four screws on the back to remove, and you simply slide the metal housing off the Bodega Bay and start expanding.

I installed a Nexus Hard-card with a pre-formatted 52-meg hard drive from Quantum, four megs of SIMMs and a SCSI Port all on one card. Advanced Storage Systems, who make the card, have a lot of faith in it - it's covered by a five-year warranty. Even though California Access does not recommend it, I installed the hard drive upside-down (it was the way it fit, sorry guys) with no problem. I screwed the card into place, then replaced the cover of the Bodega Bay and re-secured it. I powered up and booted with the disk that Nexus had thoughtfully provided for their card (the card itself, sans memory of hard drive, goes for $249 but the software will cheerfully format almost any hard disk in existence) and was treated to the sight of three Workbench partitions and all my new memory. There are included memory-checkers if some of your memory chips are bad, but since I didn't have that problem (thank goodness) I got to use the card without any problem.

The hard disk was pre-formatted, but if I'd wanted to (or been the masochistic sort) I could have used the software Nexus provided to re-partition the drive. They also provide you with backup software and software for Workbench 2.0 on the hard drive. If you have a kick-start ROM of 1.3 or above, you can autoboot from the hard drive itself.

So, the bottom line is... the Bodega Bay sells for $349 and will allow you to use almost any peripheral ever made for the Amiga including the Bridgeboard and AMAX II Plus - and in the bargain you get a power supply and cooling fan that will help your A500 expand and prosper. Get it!

## Using PageStream

Document Handling and Layout Tips by Bill Raecke

![Image](1991_08_artifacts/image_000012_ad4dffb29e210257de1de7eb1adf36402cad8d85f8d471f492e30998bf0eb3cc.png)

ince we've already covered text, fonts and graphics, really several more topics I want to cover, but this month the main topic will be document handling.

And to start off, let's cover the concept of a "Master Page". If you look at the PageStream Toolbox you will see an icon that looks like an open book. If you click on that icon you will notice that the page number shown just below that icon changes to "M". (If you have created a "Double Sided Document" you will see either "LM" or "RM" - for "Left Master" and "Right Master" respectively depending on which side of the book you clicked on. We will talk more about "Double Sided Documents" in a moment.) You are now editing the Master Page. What the Master Page does for you is to allow you to define elements - text, objects or graphics - that will appear on every page (or a least most pages) in the document you are creating. For example, on the bottom of most pages in this newsletter are the words MCCC NEWS, a month and year, a page number, and just above them, a one-point line. All of these elements are defined on a master page so that they don't need to be re-created or copied to each individual page. PageStream also takes care of the page numbering automatically. To get automatic page numbering, just go to the Master Page, get into text mode and then select "Insert Page Number" from the "Layout" menu. What you will see on the Master Page is an "M", "LM'" or "RM" corresponding to the Master Page you are editing. But when you get back to a normal page, the correct page number for that page will be displayed. Of course, even if you want to use common information across most of the pages in the document, there will be times when you don't want that information included. Does that mean that Master Pages can't be used? Not at all! On the "Layout" menu is a toggle for "Show Master Page". Ordinarily it is on and there is a check mark next to the menu item. But if you have a particular page where the master page information is not desired (such as the first and last page of this newsletter), just select that menu item and the Master Page information will be removed from that page. Note that this toggle is set for each individual page, so removing it from one page will not affect the remainder of the document.

That brings us to an explanation of the Left and Right Master Pages. First - why would you want two Master pages? If you look carefully at the bottom of the pages of this newsletter, you will see that the information at the bottom is really not exactly the same. On even-numbered (left-hand) pages the page number is on the left side of the page and the month and year are on the right. On oddnumbered (right-hand) pages it is reversed. That is the reason for the Left and Right Master Page concept. So how do you get a Left and Right Master Page? That is taken care of when you first open a new document in PageStream.

But since we're on the subject of opening a new document, let's take just a moment with the "New Page Requester". On this requester you get to choose, first of all, the size of your page. There are buttons that let you choose the most commonly used sizes including a business card size, a letter size, a legal size, etc. Other size pages can be specified by typing the values into the boxes next to the "User" heading. Values may in entered in inches, points, feet or just about anything else and can range from a minimum size of 1 inch square to a maximum of 1200 feet square (which can be printed in tiled sections). At the bottom of the requester is a selection for "Page Orientation". "Landscape" refers to a page whose largest dimension is horizontal. "Portrait" refers to a page whose largest dimension is vertical. And the last option on the "New Page Requester" - which brings us back to our original topic - is a choice between a "Single Sided Document" and a "Double Sided Document". The only effect this option has on the document is to determine whether there will be just one Master Page or a Left and a Right Master Page.

By the way - once a document has been identified as a Double Sided document, you are stuck with it. There is no way to change it back to a Single Sided document. The best you can do is define two Master Pages that are identical. This is really pretty easy to do. Simply define one of the Master Pages just the way you want it, select everything on the page (which can be done by lassoing everything or by using the "Select All" option from the "Edit" menu), and select the "Duplicate" option from the "Object" menu. In the "Duplicate" requester, specify that you want the objects duplicated one time and specify a 0 horizontal and vertical offset. The result of this will be a copy of each of the objects on the screen. The new objects will be placed in exactly the same position as were the original objects. And you will find that all the new objects are now selected - the original objects are not. Now all you need to do move all the new, duplicated objects to the other master page. This can be done by selecting the "Move To Page" option from the "Layout" menu. A requester will pop up asking what page to move the objects to. Indicate "LM" or "RM", whichever is still blank, and it's done. Remember this trick. It comes in

handy for lots of things - not just for duplicating Master Pages. It can be better than copying and pasting objects for some uses because this method ensures that the copied objects are in exactly the same position on the new page.

On the other hand, if you have a Single Sided document and you want it to be a Double Sided document - that's easy! Create a new document specifying the same page size as the document you want to convert, being sure to specify a Double Sided Document. Then simply "Append" the original document onto the end of this new document. Since the document was empty except for the existence of a left and right Master Page, the new document will look the same as it did originally - but now there are two Master Pages.

A moment ago I mentioned the concept of "Appending" one document onto another. This is an important concept to understand because it, along with the concept of templates, will save you a lot of time. I need to use the newsletter as an example again. You will notice that the layout of the first page of every issue is the same, as is the layout of the first page of each article in this series. In fact, I use a template for virtually every page in this newsletter. The idea is to keep from creating the same format over and over again. The first template I always use is what I call my "Master-Template". The only contents of this template are the Master Pages. Next, I "append" onto that template the "First-Page" template. Most of the rest of the pages are created from a template I simply call the "Two-Column" template whose only contents are the necessary text columns created in the size and location that I use consistently throughout the newsletter. These pages are "appended" onto the end of the newsletter as it develops. Of course I also have a "Chapter-Page" template, an "Officer-Page" template and others. If you are a Pagestream user you will have noticed by now that when saving a document there is a menu item for a normal save as well as an item called "Save As Template". YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THIS OPTION IN ORDER TO USE THE DOCUMENT AS A TEMPLATE. Any page can be used as a template. The only difference is in the way PageStream handles the file name. When a normal document is retrieved from disk for editing, the file name is retained. When a template is retrieved, it is brought into PageStream with no name. You are therefore a little safer from accidentally overwriting your original template when you save your document because PageStream will ask for a document name rather than assuming it already knows. But note that this applies only when opening a document. When appending a page (or pages) onto a document, no distinction exists between a normal document page and a template - the original document name is retained in either case (if there was one).

The concept of appending template pages onto an existing document in work is is just great if everything goes as planned and you can work straight through from the beginning of the document to the end with no glitches. I don't know about you, but when I put the newsletter together things rarely go that smoothly. PageStream provides a number of layout aids in that regard. Under the "Layout" menu there is an item called "Insert Page". It allows you to insert any number of pages... you tell it how many and what page they should be inserted before. There is also an item called "Delete Page". Here you tell it which pages should be deleted by starting and ending page number. By the way, in either of these instances page renumbering is automatic. An even more powerful function is the "Move Page" item from the same "Layout"

The Insert Page Requester

menu. When you activate this option, you specify what pages are to be moved and what page they should be placed before. The only thing not directly supported by PageStream is the ability to "append" a page into the middle of a document. (I know, this would not really be an "append" then, would it?) After all, just because I needed to insert a page or a series of pages into the middle of an existing document doesn't mean that I don't want to have access to my templates. But this is an easy problem to overcome - and there are at least two ways to do it. The first way is to insert a blank page where you need your template to be. Then append your template, select all the objects on the template, and use the "Move To Page" function to move them all to your newly inserted page. Alternately, you can simply append the template and use the "Move Page" function to move the appended page to the correct position in the document. Either method works as well and each is painless.

1 here's just one more topic that I want to cover this month. It's a little off the subject because it has to do with page layout rather than document handling - but better now than never. What I'm talking about is getting the text in the columns on the page to line up. Most publications use columns - normally two or three per page. The reason is that if a line contains too many characters it becomes diffieult to read. The choice between two or three columns per page is normally a function of the font being used... a column of text should optimally contain about 40 to 50 characters per line. But once the number of columns has been determined, it is important to ensure that those columns line up properly. Two columns of text, side-by-side, which are not exactly aligned will spoil the looks of a document faster than almost anything else. For that matter, text on separate pages that does not line up with text on other pages is sloppy looking as well - particularly when there are common page elements defined in a Master page which serve to highlight inconsistancies. It's a mistake made often - even by professionals. So - let me go over a few ideas that will help you avoid the problem without a lot of

First, make sure that the top of your text columns line up exactly. In PageStream there are a number of ways to do this. If you use the "Create Columns" function to create the columns in the first place, the columns will be aligned properly. Otherwise, you can achieve perfect alignment by using the "Align" function from the "Object" menu; or you can turn on the "Snap To Grid" option in the "Layout" menu and snap the top of each column to the nearest grid line; or you can simply use the "Edit Coordinates" function from the "Object" menu to specify exactly where the top of each text column should be located.

The second thing to keep in mind is to ensure that the line spacing remains constant. Otherwise you could have columns whose text lines up perfectly at the top of the column but which is not even close at the bottom. The big thing to remember here is the way that PageStream handles line spacing. The default mode is "Auto Line Spacing". In this mode, the specified number of points will be placed beneath every line, regardless of the point size of the text on that line. If large text - such as a title is placed in a column of text, text from that position on will pushed down by an amount equal to the point size of the title less the size of the rest of the text. In short, it will look bad. There are a couple of ways to solve this problem. One way is to go to "Fixed Line Spacing" mode. This will ensure that each line of text is spaced a fixed number of points below the previous line regardless of the size of the text on the line. But this could have an adverse effect on the format of the title itself. A better way is to place the header in a separate text block and then place that block on top of the other column. Add some extra blank lines to the main text column to leave room for the header or use the text run-around feature on the title block to do it for you.

The only problem that these two points don't address is a scenario where there is one column on one side of the page - and two columns positioned vertically on the other side of the page. This can happen when an article is being continued. In this case, the text from the full column needs to line up with the text in each of the two columns on the other side. One way to ensure this is by aligning the tops of ALL columns and then applying "Text RunAround" to the topmost text column on the side of the page where there are two columns. "Text Run-Around" will always cause text to be pushed down in line-space increments. The other way is the brute strength method. Draw a horizontal line on the page, change to a close view, and move the top edge of the bottom column until its text lines up with the text in the adjacent column. Nothing very elegant here - but it works. And sometimes it's the easiest way available.

Review by Bob Sackett from the newsletter of SOCK

n my quest for the ultimate Amiga 500 I have left no 1 both at and anie rel, and etaly seing the ·both.Info and Amiga World, and actually seeing the Mega-Midget Racer in a club demo by a satisfied user, I ordered one in the following configuration: 25mhz 68030 CPU with 256K static RAM (SRAM) and a 68882 FPU (math co-processor). My Amiga already had a Supra 30 meg hard drive, Fatter Agnus, 1.3 ROM, 1/2 meg w/clock internal and 2 megs external in the SupraDrive.

Be forewarned, a wise man once told me: every gift will have a cost. Did I pay attention? Naah! Let's see what happens when you mix stuff from Commodore in Pennsylvania, Supra in Oregon and CSA in California, none of whom have red telephones connecting their Presidents. It all sorta works, kinda. Previously, after considerable effort and some hardware swaps, I had the Amiga working pretty well with the Supra hard drive and memory. It autobooted and autoconfigured, I had a full meg of Chip RAM to play with, and 1.3 booted properly. Then I added the Racer. Wow!

It became a half-hour job to get my computer booted in the morning. I hadn't seen so many Gurus since the Maharishi went back to India. And then: my hard drive just flat quit from the stress of it all! It went back to its makers in Oregon, not once, but twice. This is standard, in my experience. The first send-back to Supra seems to be by way of a social call. It is returned to me in nonfunctioning status and after some phone calls the second return usually gets the job done. What can I say? It's just their policy, I guess.

While it was gone - hard drive and 2 megs of memory - I discovered the MMR worked just fine. Although I was a little short of memory, programs simply operated like lightning. ProPage screen refreshes appeared like that! Mandelbrots flooded my monitor from top to bottom, which formerly were left processing overnight. It was one hot machine! I couldn't wait to get the hard disk back with all my programs on it and memory to run them.

The day arrived and Supra delivered; new controller and new hard disk - same old memory board. I put it back together and my original problems returned. The drive worked, the memory was there; the damn thing just wouldn't boot without about twenty resets. Even after it booted, you weren't completely secure; the Guru lurked behind the monitor glass. Things that would cause you to faint, I learned to laugh at. "Read/Write Error on DHO:" was common. "Volume Systemo is not Validated!" "Hah!" Flashing Gurus imploring me to push my left mouse button and "SoftWare Error: Task Held!" were part of my daily operation.

Supra didn't have an opinion about the MMR except to say they have been having some problems mating their new Xl drives to the MIMR (I have the older model); CSA, who makes the MIMR, felt the problem was on the Supra end of things; and Commodore had no ideas about anything, including when 2.0 would be out! CSA, which is in north San Diego, said I could bring my whole operation down and they'd try to solve the problem. Kelly, the super-tech at Creative, had suggested I look at my Supra memory board and I relayed this to Steve, head technician at CSA. The Gurus pointed in that direction also, and as soon as the offending board was removed from its case in the hard drive, life returned to normal. (CSA spent two hours on me and I can't speak too highly of their customer support, both in person and over the phone. They were interested in my problem and took pains to solve it.)

Could anything else go wrong? Remember the words of the wise man... Two things got my attention. My ASDG VDO: RAM disk was no longer being created by my startup-sequence and Pro Video Post wouldn't load because it said I didn't have enough memory for it. Three megs isn't enough? That wasn't the problem. PV Post is one of the few programs the requires fatter Agnus to operate. It needs to see at least 880K of Chip RAM before it will boot. That's funny! I run FastMemFirst and my chip RAM was still being nibbled at on the startup, causing it to fall below PV Post's requirement! Why?

"Just great!" ", I thought. "I've got the fastest 500 in town but I can't run any programs that require more than a meg of memory." Wrong, ByteBreath! For only a few hundred dollars more I can replace the disgusting, embarrassing 16 bit memory with the wonderful, new 32 bit DRAMs. Not having much choice, I ordered two megs of their finest and wouldn't leave the premises until I saw it working perfectly.

According to CSA, I am the first to notice this problem. Using a program that displays my memory in three catagories: Chip, Fast, and Static, I discovered I had about 850K of Chip, OK of Fast, and around 2 megs of Static RAM. Programs, after seeing 0 Fast RAM, do what they were designed to do and go after the Chip memory. They don't know anything about the newer Static RAM! ASDG's VDO: uses Fast RAM specifically. What I'm saying is... any program that directly addresses Fast RAM as such is not going to find your hidden wealth of Static RAM and will probably not work. CSA is looking into this.

So here I sit, with a 25mhz computer, a 33mhz FPU, a hard drive loaded with swell programs, and a Fatter Agnus who seems to have joined Weight Watchers. I want to tell you, from the depths of my soul, it's scary out here on the cutting edge of technology!

I called Supra again. I'll say this for them - when you present them with a hard fact they finally 'fess up. When I told them that CSA's tech had narrowed the problem down to Supra's autoconfigure chips, they said they knew about this and would call me back if and when they got a fix. They said the problem was in Commodore's memory allocation which, although well documented on the 2000, is vague on the 500... various companies might arrive at different conclusions causing incompatibilities. In the meantime I have several hundred dollars worth of Supra board and memory in a plastic bag waiting for the call. This, if it ever works again, will become my Fast RAM.

Public Domain and shareware picks by Bill Raecke

On disks MCCC-A\_308 and MCCC-A\_309 this month you will find another great collection of Postscript Type 1 fonts for use with PageStream. This is a really nice set with display, script and serif styles on one disk and sans serif and ornament styles on the other. Most of them come with the bit-mapped screen fonts which really helps speed up the screen display. You can never have too many fonts, can you?

## Snap by Mikael Karlsson

Snap is one of those invaluable little utilities that Commodore certainly meant to include when they sold us our Amigas but that somehow got forgotten. I've probably written about Snap in this column before - and it has even been featured recently as our ShareWare Pick of the Month. But for those who missed it in the past or for those who are new to our club, Snap is a little cut and paste utility. To activate it, you run the program. Thereafter when you press the left Amiga key and the left mouse button, Snap will be activated and will proceed to draw a box around the area of text you specify by dragging the mouse pointer to the other corner. When you release the left Amiga key, the copy is completed. Then, simply position the cursor where you want the copied text to be placed and press the left Amiga-i combination. The text will be inserted. The really powerful thing about all this is that it makes no difference what application you are copying from or to. You can take text from a word processor and paste it to a spreadsheet or you can copy from your CLI to a text editor. Whatever you like. And you can also clip a graphic image from any screen or window by using the right Amiga key to do the cut rather than the left. A small window will be placed on the Amiga Workbench containing your clipped image. It can then be saved to disk as an IFF brush and used any way you like.

month's picks is that there is a new version of Snap available. This version fixes a few problems (none of which I ever encountered), adds support for larger fonts and makes it totally AmigaDOS 2.0 compatible. This one can be found on MCCC-A\_320.

## The History of Amy by Eric Schwartz

Another great one from Eric Schwartz. But this one's not an animation. The History of Amy is a slideshow that traces the cartoon career of Amy the Squirrel as she makes her way from bit parts in Disney cartoons in the late 30's through her current stardom working in Eric Schwartz animations. One particularly funny period is Amy's brief stint at Hanna-Barbera (although Amy didn't consider it funny at all). The slideshow features Eric's great art-work and super sense of humor, If you're a fan of Eric Schwartz (or Amy the Squirrel), you'll want to get this disk. Look for MCCC-A\_310 this month.

excellent pictures to our library. This month is no exception. You will find examples on many of this month's disks. But this column is where I'm supposed to tell you my favorites. On MCCC-A 314 you will find such gems as Cranes, Lighthouse2 and Candle. On MCCC-A \_317 is a great picture called Winter2. On MCCCA 318 there are a couple of terrific nature pics called

## ClipArt

For those of us who use PageStream or other desktop publishing programs, there is another windfall this month. We have a large set of clipart added to our library, most of which is courtesy of an excellent user group in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. This is bitmapped clipart in IFF format. In other words, it is a set of pictures - but these are black and white pictures designed specifically for use in desktop publishing applications. If you are into this kind of thing you'll want to check out this collection. Look for it on MCCC-A\_315, MCCC-A\_316 and MCCC-A\_317.

Sounds are associated with each picture to make things more interesting and there is a feature that will paint the screen with a demonstration set of colors. Since being demonstrated at a couple of chapter meetings a month or two ago, the program has undergone some finishing and is now (in answer to popular demand) ready for release. Note that even though it was written using CanDo, you do not need to own CanDo to use the program. CanDo has released a public domain player which is included on the disk so the program is ready to go. If you are one of those who has been anxiously awaiting the release of this one, your time has finally arrived. If you know nothing about it, you may want to check it out - particularly if you have young children.

Garry Wordelman many artistic talents. Keep up the good work, Barbara. We like famous people in our club.

We had a total of 31 at out July Meeting, which is not too bad for mid-summer. Vacations and outdoor activities seem to take their toll at this time of the year.

Our ShareWare for the month was LZ by Jonathan Forbes. Dave Owens gave a brief description of this package which is used for archiving files in a compressed form. This is used primarily for saving disk space or for telecommunications. When the file is needed, you call it up using the decompression program which expands it back to normal form. You can find this in the club library on SuperDisk "SD TeleUtill".

Our program for the month was a very good presentation by Barbara Cramer (our own chapter Vice President). Barbara brought in several pictures and designs she has made with the aid or assistance of her computer. She showed illustrations and designs she had created for a design class at TCJC. By using Deluxe Paint to help create, alter, and/or color her designs, she was able to generate patterns, characters and illustrations often used in advertising graphics. She said it helped considerably in learning many new techniques and shortcuts in art processing. Barbara also displayed several pictures which she had created from photographs. By using the Art Department and a scanner, she could create a graphic file of the desired photo, manipulate it in a variety of ways, and then separate the colors into print patterns for making stencils. With these stencils she was able to make portrait-quality screen printed pictures for wall mounting. She has used this procedure to create pictures on t-shirts and for limited-edition portraits which she sells for profit. Barbara has done some excellent work and it is obvious that she has

The July meeting of the Amiga Central Chapter featured Jody Reimers demonstrating Imagine. We saw some terrific animations and beautiful 3-D art. Jody created a 3-D rendering of a mortar and pestle (our frustrated chemists in the crowd came up with this idea from scratch. Watching him work was a terrific Imagine tutorial. You can see some of Jody's work by contacting Studio Amiga, Jody's internationally famous 3-D and ray tracing BBS, at (817) 467-3658. You will find lots of 3-D

Our July meeting also included the usual question/answer session and some discussion of recent rumors in the Amiga community. Jerry Hambley (from the Amiga West chapter) announced the opening of his new Amiga dealership in Fort Worth. Ansoft Data Systems, Inc. will be located on University between 7th and Lancaster.

The August meeting is still being planned. We will possibly see a demonstration of Superbase Professional 4 by Precision Software.

Well, I did it again... deadlines just kill me. The first time the new Every Fourth Saturday rule was invoked, it fell in the only month with FIVE Saturdays, and I blew it. Sorry about the missing chapter news, and I hope I never let it happen again.

The June meeting was well attended, and we all loved seeing Eric Schwartz's Anti-Lemmin' Demo. We also enjoyed a fancy music video and a Toaster demo video. Thanks, Brett Hester, for putting them together to share with us. We heard our first news about The Edge and their new BBS, Users Group, benefits for club members, etc., and their very fine professional production studio. We heard that Hard Warehouse is going out of the Amiga business. We had on hand the new mouse-button switches, lots of bulk-priced blank disks, 10 new Fred Fish additions, and 10 new MCCC club disks, including some (ahem) adult items. Our Shareware Pick of the Month was IconMaster, an icon editor used and enjoyed by many. Brett has created thousands of icons, and "does requests" - he can design

the image in Deluxe Paint (as a brush) or create it in the IconMaster built-in editor/paint program. Look for IconMaster on the Iconstruction disk in our library, on one of our SuperDisks,or on one of the Fred Fish disks.

Our June demo was presented by Eddie Churchill and Tim Martin from INOVAtronics. They put CanDo 1.5 through its paces, highlighting the changes and improvements and giving a lightning overview of all the capabilities. Comparing CanDo with the AmigaVision package, they explained that AmigaVision is great for presentations and special effects, but not as good for stand-alone applications, where a lot of programming and complex options are needed. CanDo has program editor tools and mini-programs it can write for you (including comments if desired) to accomplish a series of effects painlessly. The 1.4 release had lots of neat, complicated features that users found TOO complex, and so tended to avoid. Now there are simpler but more powerful tools to do all the neat stuff with less details for you to do on the lower level. CanDo 1.5 now comes on 3 diskettes, with many simple examples, including a home budget program. There are 100-odd more pages of manual, by the way. There's an Intro Pack of examples and samples that is good and now available... INOVAtronics will consider well-designed and useful demo items for future inclusion in CanDo or its offshoots. Also available: "clip art" multi-media goodies and all kinds of buttons, etc. Coming Soon: the Interface Design Kit with about 500 "building blocks" on 4 diskettes, to list for $59.95, some wonderful art from the Canvas company, and the Lunar Construction Set with space-theme clip art, backgrounds, etc. If you bought CanDo after 12/15/90, you can probably get the upgrade FREE, as it was announced but not delivered for a few months. The Design Kit stuff also works with AmigaVision, etc., as it contains standard IFF files.

On To July! Rumors Department: Lightwave 3D, now part of the toaster, may become a separate package. 2.0 ROMs are now available for developers, and the release is "just around the corner" (But how big is the corner?) DPAINT IV is coming! NewTek is reportedly talking to Apple about a "toaster peripheral" for the MacIntosh, sez Byte. NewTek would be happy to make a toaster that works with the A3000, but would Commodore mind very much changing its box so the board will fit? The Edge's new BBS phone number was offered: 9609017. (Free!) Q&amp; A: Where can I find kidstuff cheap? (Our Club Library has much.) What MAC programs run with which emulator? (Avoid Mac II compatible programs with AMAX.) Also questions about compressing a file, cabling a new disk drive, and possible future meeting topics. PLEASE bring ideas to the meeting if you have suggestions for future demos, either something you would like to see, or

something you could share with us! Our shareware spotlight was on LZ, an archiving program. The newest version, 1.9, supports LH5 and has excellent speed, and "you can't beat it for compression". If you like the shareware we discuss each month, please contribute to the author in our Shareware Contributions Jar!

Our Demo Star for July was the ever-effervescent Brett Hester with his Toaster and DCTV, presenting animation illustrations. He took us on a whirlwind tour of the Most Excellent Paint Program in the World (quote) that comes with DCTV. It has lots of special features, some that exist nowhere else (like a realistic watercolor effect), and best of all it animates in 16,776,216 colors. (Only Brent would give us the EXACT number. Did he count them?) Iliked the magnify feature that blew up the selected area up to 8 times. I'll fix that pixel!!! Brent digitized an innocent bystander and then used the paint program to do really strange and amazing things to him. Awesome, except that there is no UNDO! Then on to the Toaster, the neatest thing since sliced bread. (I've been dying to say that, just once.) We saw a bouncing world created with a VistaPro scenery background (imported in), a sphere created by Modeler 3D (a part of Lightwave 3D), and a flat IFF map image wrapped around the sphere. Then we watched a "plain" globe develop as he added textures and light effects to various surfaces. Then this object was shown as line views from three angles and a line animation. Brett placed the object in the center of the field of view, then materialized a little light image and moved it around... the lighting effects would result as though the actual light source was wherever he placed it. Then the "camera" was moved hither and yon to give us a view of what the globe looked like from different angles. At last, the camera, light source, and object were

"fixed" in a set position, a second position was selected, and Lightwave 3D was told to work its magic: render the appropriate animation sequences to make it appear that the camera had moved from Here to There in live action. Moments later, we saw the result: we were whisked around the globe as though we had orbited it ourselves, and no tedious frame-by-frame design and sequencing had been done by human hands. Spectacular! Thanks, Brett, for a fascinating journey.

Our doorprizes for July were Modeler 3D and Transcript from The Edge, and Colorado and Renegade Legion Interceptor from Metropolitan. Thanks, guys!!! Coming in August: special guests from Metropolitan with the latest software, hardware, and news from the world of Amiga. Don't miss it, August 21st!

We had a demonstration of several disks that are in the club library. Here are a few of the disks that were demonstrated: #337, a utilities disk; #538, Omega-Q II; #545 &amp; #546, a cataloger and data disk; #549 with C-64 Cross Trivia game and recipe file that includes the Neiman-Marcus cookie recipe; and #704, (128 disk) that had a flag and map display and a bi-plane game.

A disk review was given by Jack Hagemeyer on last month's door prize, Crime and Punishment. The object of this game is to sentence a criminal for his wrong-doings. This month's door prize, The Dallas Quest, was won by Delta Stewart, one of our recent new members. We look forward to her review of The Dallas Quest. Please note, our recent door prizes have been generously donated by John Burk and Stephen Burk. Thanks a lot guys!

## HEB Robyn Wilson

At the August meeting we discussed file referencing and reorganizing programs. A program called 'The Organizer' was presented as an example of this utility.

All future meetings (until further notice) will be held at the Hurst Recreation Center on Mary Drive at 1:30 pm on the first Saturday of each month. Notice will be given here if there are any changes.

At the September meeting, different word processing programs will be discussed. This will be for use on both the C64 and C128.
