## MegaChip 2000

Expanding to 2 megabytes of chip RAM by Johnny C. Kitchens fall the various parts of the computer, one area computer, and that is memory. One thing for sure - the more memory you have the more you can do. For many easy memory expansion becomes an important design consideration of their next computer, but this has been one area of home computers that was more likely neglected by the designers. At least the Amiga was one computer to buck that trend. When I moved up from the C-128 to the Amiga 1000, my first decision was for memory expansion. During the time I owned the 128 I never pushed the limits of its 128k of RAM. The 1000 came with 256k and for the life of me I could not see the need for more. The salesman showed me some demos and then told me they wouldn't run without the expansion. After much thought I decided to buy. A simple little box that plugged into the front of the 1000 under a little cover. Sheer simplicity for sure. 512k of memory and I was sure I would never need it all. Boy, how wrong could I be. For two years I stuck with the 512k, but the more I learned the more I needed. Finally I added a 2 meg memory expansion. Suddenly my computer seemed to be faster and I could do anything I wanted. With memory, more is definitely better, but doesn't that hold true with everything to do with computers, except size.

With the Amiga a different thought on memory expansion emerges. You have chip RAM and fast RAM to consider. I've noticed many people are confused by the two terms. Chip RAM should be looked at as a work area for the Amiga. The custom chips of the Amiga do all their magic in the chip RAM and the CPU can share in the chip RAM. It's happier, though, with its own RAM which is called fast RAM. Indeed, adding fast RAM does give a boost in performance, and most of the 8 megs you can add to the 500, 1000, 2000, and 2500 will indeed be fast RAM. The 3000 can have even more.

Chip RAM will give you the most problems when using it and in expanding it. No matter how much memory you have, run out of chip RAM and it's all over. The 256k expansion for the 1000 was all chip RAM. This was the easiest chip RAM expansion available ever. Didn't even have to move the computer or monitor. Only the 3000 comes close with plug in memory for the chip RAM. The 3000 set a new upper limit in chip RAM - 2 megs worth. The 500 and 2000 came with 512k and in order to increase that required a chip replacement. By replacing the Agnus chip, access to 1 meg of chip memory was available. It makes a big difference with more chip RAM especially if the custom chips are working their special magic. Is there a way for 500 and 2000 owners to get more?

DKB Industries now offers a way for the 2000 owner to expand to a full 2 megs of chip RAM, and a similar product is promised for the 500 soon. What they offer is a small circuit board with 1 meg of RAM on board and a place for the 2 meg Super Agnus (the same as in the 3000), a special block to plug into the existing Agnus mount, and one jumper. No soldering necessary, the ads say, and easy installation. First part right, second - well maybe. I decided to find out.

Checking around the various magazine ads I found one mail order company offering a very good deal. DKB advertises the board for $299, without the 2 meg Agnus. The Grapevine Group advertises the board with 2 meg Agnus for $338 plus they offer $45 rebate for your old 1 meg Agnus. Consider that the 2 meg Agnus goes for $120 by itself and their price sounds pretty good. Also they offer a tool to remove the existing Agnus for free. I sent them my order.

What I received was from them was well packed and has a very clearly written instruction book. If you have the 512k Agnus then the instructions tell you how to convert to the 2 meg Agnus. There are plenty of pictures · Page 5

## The A2320 Display Enhancer

Eliminating flicker without emptying your bank account by Bill Raecke game. (I have not noticed any ghosting as yet.)

You can still use an external genlock with the Display Enhancer. You can also continue using your standard RGB video output for another monitor..

## Problems

The only problem I have encountered is a small one. On my monitor, an NEC MultiSync 3D, the horizontal width of the display is decreased, giving me a visible black border on each side of the screen. The border cannot be eliminated using the external controls on the monitor and is an annoyance. I don't know if this problem exists with all monitors and I don't yet know if it can be corrected. (This same border exists when the flickerFixer is used.)

...does just what MicroWay's flickerFixer does - but at half the price.

## Comparison - flickerFixer to Display Enhancer

The Display Enhancer will install only in the video slot. The flickerFixer will install in either the video slot or on a special "Denise Extender" (available at extra cost). The advantage here is that the Video Toaster plugs into the video slot. If you have a Toaster or are planning on getting one, Commodore's Display Enhancer is not for you.

As far as I can tell, the flickerFixer has no bypass switch which allows you to turn it off at will. This may or may not be a problem since I have seen no reason to disable it so far.

The flickerFixer costs twice as much.

## Installation

I had no problem at all installing the board. If you have ever been inside an Amiga 2000, there is nothing new here. Simply remove the cover, remove the plate at the back of the video slot, install a special grounding clip to the Amiga frame (it slides on), push the card into the slot, attach it to the back of the Amiga with two screws, and put the cover back on the Amiga. The only other thing which might be necessary is to adjust the board.

→ Page 5

the standard Amiga video output. We adjust the colors of the display and tell ourselves it's not that bad. In fact, the proper choice of colors can minimize flicker considerably, but it's always there and we all wish there were a way to eliminate it entirely. Of course there has been a way for quite some time now. The flickerFixer from MicroWay has been available for years, but its price has discouraged many of us from purchasing it. Five hundred dollars is simply more than I was willing to part with to eliminate flicker.

Now there is an alternative. Commodore has released the A2320 Display Enhancer that does just what MicroWay's flickerFixer does - but at half the price. The A2320 is the same technology that is built into the Amiga 3000. It comes on a small card that fits into the video slot on your Amiga 2000 series computer. Like the flickerFixer, it requires that you own a multiscan monitor. Those that it will work with include the Commodore 1950, NEC MultiSync monitors, Mitsubishi DiamondScan, Zenith ZCM 1490, and a lot of others. What you need is a monitor that will sync with a horizontal frequency from 15.625 to 31.468 Khz.

## Features

In interlaced modes, every other line of the video display is sent to the screen and then the alternate lines are sent, starting each time at the top of the display. The Display Enhancer captures both parts of the display, combines them, and sends them out at twice the standard display rate, thus eliminating flicker.

In non-interlaced modes, every scan line is duplicated before sending it to the monitor. Thus the visible scan lines normally present on non-interlaced displays are eliminated.

The board supports severe overscan.

It is compatible with both NTSC and PAL video formats.

It supports the ECS display modes, so that when we all upgrade to AmigaDOS 2.0 it will still work.

There is a mode switch which extends from the back of the Amiga when the board is installed which allows you to disable the enhancement feature. This is necessary when using the AmigaDOS 2.0 Superhires mode and may be desireable if ghosting is encountered on a fast-moving

## MegaChip 2000 (Continued from Page 1)

to show you the way. That was easy enough.

Installation was the hard part. Thanks to the modular design of the 2000 installation is definitely not as hard as it may appear. Anyone familiar with the disassembly of the 2000 can easily install the MegaChip 2000. After all, I'm no expert and I had no trouble. Removing the cover was definitely step one. Next, removal of the disk drive and power supply tray as one unit. After its removal I took a moment to admire the apparent simplicity of the Amiga. It just doesn't seem to be that much to it. Removal of the Agnus chip was the next step. Using the supplied tool failed completely. Its hooks were too big to fit the small slots. I had to resort to a method I had used several times in the past. A small screw driver was inserted into the slot and the Agnus was slowly lifted from its cradle. I later reworked the tool so that it will be usable for future jobs. The MegaChip 2000 board is very compact. Definitely the smallest board to go into my Amiga yet. Curiously the board installs upside down with all the mounted chips facing downward. The board also covers Denise. If anything should need to go under Denise such as some of the new flicker control devices coming out, there maybe a problem. I have the Microway flickerFixer and was not worried about that. If you are considering the Super Denise as a future upgrade you have nothing to worry about. MegaChip 2000 converts Agnus from one of the more difficult chips to remove to definitely the easiest. All you need for the future is a finger and a thumb. It's that easy. Lining up the white block with the Agnus mount was a little difficult as you can't see them going together. Line them up and push. There is no click or anything to tell it's in place you just have to feel it move a small amount and accept that it is there. There is one jumper to connect. It has a small push button affair with a hook to catch a leg on the Gary chip. This requires a careful count to ensure a proper connection. Reassembly of everything and I was ready to turn on my computer and enjoy the new power.

Turning on my computer brought a shock to my eyes. The picture was messed up in a very strange way. Each scan line was out of alignment with the next. I switched to the standard RGBA output and the image was fine. Oh no! My flicker Fixer doesn't like the new addition. Upon switching back to the flicker fixer output it was fine. It was at this point that I realized that the flicker Fixer needs adjustment. Another problem bites the dust.

MegaChip 2000 has worked with everything with no problem. Of course I don't have everything to try, but games that appear to be unhappy with most accessories appear to be happy with it and have yet to complain about it. The main benefit of MegaChip 2000 will be for people heavy into graphics and sound. Being able to work with even larger files certainly shows benefits in all cases. One area I immediately came upon was sound. A digitized sound file of 938k which I attempted to play with Audiomaster Ill and a one meg Agnus gave me a message that the file had to be shortened to 625k to work. With the two meg Agnus, the file loaded completely. I was able to load up more graphic images than ever before. A really long animation should be much easier. The memory now has an expansion capacity of 10 megs instead of 9.

MegaChip 2000 is not for everybody, but if you push your Amiga in multitasking, graphics, or sound then the MegaChip 2000 is your kind of upgrade. It offers no apparent performance benefits that the 1 meg Agnus offered over the 512k Agnus - just the added memory capacity. Isn't that enough?

## Display Enhancer (Continued from Page 3)

Included is a special adjustment tool (really just a small plastic screwdriver). On the plate which attaches to the back of the Amiga, just above the bypass switch, is a small adjustment screw. Included with the hardware are a couple of IFF pictures which can be used to help you adjust the display if necessary. The idea is to turn the adjustment screw until there is no jitter anywhere in the display and there is no color bleed. The board I purchased required no adjustment at all - but not knowing that I quickly had it out of adjustment and then had to get it back again. Still, it was no problem.

## Recommendation?

You bet! The display is beautiful. The elimination of flicker is the obvious reason for purchasing the Display Enhancer, but the results are just as pleasing on a noninterlaced display. It's surprising the difference the elimination of those scan lines makes. One visual byproduct of duplicating every scan line in non interlaced modes, however, is that it emphasizes jaggies. You will want to replace Topaz as your system font. I have been using Siesta for years. Siesta is a more squared-off font that I find easier to read. With the Display Enhancer, the squared-off feature pays off. (For those who may not know how to replace your system font, first find a font that you want to try, put it in your font directory, and type the command "FF Siesta font". Substitute the name of your font for Siesta. When you find one you want to use all the time, put it in your startup-sequence. You should already find the FF command there without the font name.)

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks by Bill Raecke

ERMIT by A. G. Kartsatos (HERMES) Anyone who doesn't have HERMiT needs to get it. HERMiT is one of those invaluable little utilities that most of us just couldn't get along without. What it does is save the front screen to disk as an IFF file. If you think about it for a little while you'll see how valuable this can be. You can see the results of my use of it in this newsletter. All you need to do is run the program or click on its icon from the Workbench. At startup, the HERMIT brings up a screen that asks you for a path to save the screen captures to. Also on the screen is a list of the hot keys necessary to activate the program. The combination of CTRL+L-ALT+S will activate the save function.

Actually HERMiT has been around for quite some time. But this is version 1.3. New to this version are the ability to save the font from the from screen and to save the pointer from the front screen. Both are very worth while additions. Look for this one on MCCC-A\_268.

## PageStream Fonts

Also on MCCC-A 268, PageStream users will be pleased to find another font collection. This one consists of public domain fonts in the Soft-Logik format. There are eleven fonts included: Burl Oblique, Calligraphy, Chancery, Chicago, Flash, Harloe, Oakville, Olympia, Souvenir Medium, Souvenir Medium Italic, and Western. Several of them are excellent.

## 3D Images

On MCCC-A 270 is a collection of 3D images. If you collect pictures (and who doesn't) you will want to add these to your collection to show off to your friends who don't yet own an Amiga. They have been done with the latest 3D packages available. Two of them (the two featuring the 7-Up Spot) were ray-traced with Imagine. The other five were produced with Lightwave 3D, the package that comes with The Video Toaster.

## Sounds

If you are a fan of Looney-Tune cartoons you will want several of the sound files on MCCC-A\_271. There is one of Porky Pig trying to say "I feel ridiculous" - and failing. There is one of Daffy Duck. And there is one of Yosemite Sam - "Yu durn'd crazy galoot". I can't reproduce them here. Get them at the next meeting.

## The MCCC BBS

Everything you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask by Harold Williams

1 he Metroplex Commodore Computer Club Bulletin recently. This article is an attempt to update our members on these changes and at the same time provide some general information about the club's BBS. If you are currently a member of the BBS, I hope you will find some new information here. If you are not a member of the BBS maybe this article will arouse your interest in one of our club's finest benefits.

## The Basics

The MCCC Bulletin Board System is supported solely by MCCC members that have chosen to also be members of the BBS. All equipment, software and expenses of operating the BBS are paid for with the BBS dues. Membership on the MCCC BBS is restricted to MCCC members. BBS membership must run concurrent with the club membership. MCCC members can join the BBS at any time by paying a fee of one dollar for each month remaining on their club membership. BBS members are allowed 90 minutes of access to the BBS each day with each call restricted to no more than 45 minutes and no restriction on the number of calls. Doing a little math with the above numbers yields a rate of 3 1/2 cents per hour for a person that makes maximum use of the BBS.

The operation of the MCCC BBS is supervised by the sysop, Okley Moss. He is assisted by a committee that is appointed by the MCCC Board of Directors. committee currently consists of Okley, John Malmstrom, Bill Raecke, and myself.

Our BBS hardware currently consists of an Amiga 2000, 3 megabytes of RAM, 185 megabytes of hard drive storage, two 2400 Baud modems connected to two metro lines, and a streaming tape backup system. The hard drive storage was just recently increased to 185 megabytes through the purchase of a 105 megabyte Quantum drive (a big "thank you" to Amazing Computer Systems for the special deal). Another recent acquisition was the streaming tape device. We purchased the backup system directly from Xetec. This backup system has greatly reduced the workload on the sysop and also has reduced system down time. Currently, complete backups are requiring only 30 minutes. The same backup to floppy disk was requiring about two hours. Although the BBS funds are basically spent for this year, the committee is already looking into other hardware improvements. The next hardware upgrade will probably be the installation of at least one 9600 Baud modem.

The BBS software is Paragon 2.081 from Inner Circle Software. Paragon was recently upgraded at no expense. The upgrade consisted primarily of small bug fixes. This software allows the use of multiple phone lines. Paragon supports multiple message areas, multiple file upload/download areas, and "doors" that allow access to external software. What that means to our members is increased access to the BBS through the simultaneous use of two phone lines (someday maybe more). Paragon provides a wide variety of options for handling personal messages, public messages and information sections. Currently there are special message areas for club business, Amiga, C-64, and C-128. There is a message area for our VidSIG members and our Programmer SIG members. There is also a special message area for exchanging information about games. It is also possible to

Recent additions are an additional 105 megabytes of storage in the form of a Quantum hard drive, and a 150 megabyte streaming tape backup system from Xetec.

leave private mail for any BBS member. Other areas on the BBS provide information about the club and club activities. These areas include data on meeting schedules, special events, officer lists, membership lists, and information on special discounts to MCCC members.

## What You Get

The file transfer section of the BBS provides a diverse selection of programs and data files. The files available for download are divided by computer type. There are separate areas for the C-64, C-128 and Amiga. Within each computer type the files are further divided into categories such as Games, Fonts, Pictures, Animations, Music, Applications, Utilities, etc. The files found in the download area consists of the best software from the MCCC library and the most recent freely distributable software. There is also a download area dedicated to providing information about the MCCC library. The library files area provides complete listings of all the disks in the MCCC Amiga library. These listings include all the Fred Fish disks, the MCCC disks and also listings of the current new disks for the month.

Although the message areas, information areas, and file transfer areas are the primary functions of the BBS there are a couple of other interesting options for BBS members. The "Today in History" section gives

information about birthdays, holidays, and important happenings for the current day. The "Reflections" option displays a special thought for the day. There is also an option to "enter a door", · The doors option gives access to programs that run external to the BBS software. Currently we offer six "doors". Five of these are games: Adventure (the original), Space Empire (an opportunity to rule the universe), Casino (for those that can't afford a trip to Las Vegas), Hangman (the old word game) and Death (a good way to quickly lose your "BBS life"). The sixth door is a questionnaire that will calculate your life expectancy.

The MCCC BBS is very active. We are currently averaging about 45 calls per day, 12 messages per day, 4 uploads per day, 61 downloads per day, and about 14 hours of on-line usage per day.

Members of the MCCC BBS have daily access to a large library of freely distributable software, music, art work and information files through the download libraries. The library of available files is constantly growing and changing as our members upload over 120 files per month. The additional 105 meg hard drive will allow a much larger collection of files to be maintained BBS members also have the opportunity to participate in lively discussions concerning all aspects of computer usage. A question or comment posted in the public message area always generates multiple responses from other members. There is no better way to get information concerning your computer, hardware or software.

If you are interested in the MCCC BBS contact one of the club officers. The fee is based on the number of months remaining on your MCCC membership. You will also need a modem and telecommunication software. You will have to get the modem on your own, but there are many telecommunications programs available in the club library. I hope to see you on the BBS soon!

## Trackball?

by Steve Warren from the Central Texas Amiga Computer Society just bought an Amtrac trackball (from Microspeed) 1 replacemenal old on atra tral as mouse replacements.

One major advantage is the increase in precision when moving the cursor. For some reason it is more difficult to move a mouse cursor precisely than it is to move a trackball cursor. You don't realize just how imprecise a mouse can be until you spend some time working with a good trackball.

Now, for most trackballs the biggest problem usually is in trying to manipulate the buttons while still being able to move the ball. The Amtrac solves this with a "right-button" toggle switch at the top-center. For menu selections, click the middle button once, roll to your selection, then click again to select the menu item.

This feature has made me aware of a minor irritation that I wasn't even aware of until it went away. Occasionally when selecting menu items with a mouse I accidentally release the button without intending to. This does not happen often, but it does happen. It's something that subconsciously I am guarding against whenever I am selecting from the menu with my mouse. But with my Amtrac I'm not even worried about it because the menu is locked in until I click the button the second time to make my selection. This makes a subtle difference in my relaxation level when I am using the Amtrac.

There are also regular right and left buttons that function identically to the right and left buttons on the mouse. These buttons are laid out as a split ring that encircles the ball completely, except for the extra button at the top-center mentioned earlier. The two halves of the ring are large, making them easy to use with any finger or the thumb, or the edge of the hand by flicking the wrist. This design is the best button layout I've ever seen on a trackball. The Amtrac is the second trackball I've purchased, and I've used or observed many others.

The Amtrac also has a very polished appearance, and it really looks sharp sitting next to my Amiga. The color matches the Amiga, and the curving slope from the back down to the front matches the keyboard slope, in addition to providing a comfortable resting place for the heel of my hand.

Finally, the biggest advantage of a trackball is the amazing quantity of desk real estate that it reclaims. No more reaching reflexively for a blank patch of desktop. The Amtrac takes up its relatively modest square of space next to my keyboard, and that is all the space it will ever need.

I paid approximately $75 for mine (I don't remember the exact amount).

## Using PageStream

The Basics of Font Usage - Part 1 by Bill Raecke

![Image](1991_04_artifacts/image_000006_0df4af3b5c7fb4550ef55a7ac3df5c6cab31a127225b1e007446c5230667f715.png)

ately there has been quite a bit of interest shown , by some of our membership in using Pagestream. Invariably, questions arise when anyone is first exposed to this product. It is big and can be overpowering if you don't know what to expect. I feel a certain responsibility to those of you experiencing difficulties since many of you purchased Soft-Logik's PageStream based on my recommendations in the MCCC News. To ease my conscience a bit and perhaps to make your familiarization somewhat easier, 1 am going to undertake a series of articles which will try to make things a little clearer. Some of what I will cover here will be basic concepts and terminology concerning desktop publishing in general but most will relate directly PageStream.

The combination of the typeface and the chosen size is properly a "font". The terminology is changing, however. In a few years no-one will remember the term "typeface" outside the classroom. Since this isn't a college classroom I'm going to use the term "font" to describe a "typeface". It's easier to type and everyone knows what I'm talking about.

First, let me say at the outset that I will be as complete as possible. I know, however, that short of writing a book (or, perhaps a series of books) there is no way I can cover everything there is to know about the subject. To make matters worse, I don't know everything there is to know on the subject, so there is information that can't be shared - at least not by me. For example, I have no experience with color or with sending documents to PostScript devices. But since I've been using Pagestream for two years now to produce the MCCC News, I'm probably the resident expert. If there are things that I don't cover completely enough or questions that I haven't covered at all, drop a line to the club P.O. box, leave a message on the BBS, or simply give me a call. I'll try to include the additional information or clarification in future articles.

Now - on to the first in the series: Using PageStream - The Basics of Font Usage - Part 1.

Desktop publishing packages allow combining text and graphics into a single document. Given that premise, it's hard to know where to start. But on the theory that the primary purpose is putting text on paper with graphics being used for clarification and interest, Ill start with handling text.

First, some basics. Fonts. Most of us know what a font is - or think we do. A font is a set of characters of a particular design. Actually, that description does not define a font at all. The proper term to go with that description is a "typeface". · Modern typefaces used in desktop publishing programs are "outline fonts". Their shape is determined by mathematical descriptions rather than as a specific dot patterns thus they can be displayed and printed at any size desired with excellent results.

In terms of font types, PageStream is capable of using most of what is out there. First, there are Soft-Logik's own proprietary outline fonts. There are eight of them included in the PageStream package. Secondly, AGFA Compugraphic fonts can be used. There are three families included with PageStream. Thirdly, PostScript Type 1 and Type 3 fonts can be used. The accompanying table shows some of the features and drawbacks of each type.

|                       | Output   | Dot-Matrix PostScript Hinted Output   |            |
|-----------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|------------|
| Sott-Logik            | Yes      | Yes                                   | No         |
| Compugraphic          | Yes      | Limited                               | Yes        |
| PostScript Type 1 Yes |          | Yes                                   | PostScript |
| PostScript Type 3 No  |          | Yes                                   | No         |

If you use a PostScript printer, stick with the PostScript fonts for best results. Compugraphic fonts will work when going to a PostScript printer only if they have been included in PageStream's font equivalent table. If you use any other kind of printer (as most of us do), Compugraphic fonts will give the best results because they are "hinted" fonts and PageStream will use their "hinted" technology when going to any dot-matrix printer. Note that dot-matrix refers to ANY non-PostScript printer. This includes inkjet and laser printers. You may be wondering about now, "Just what the heck is a 'hinted' font?". Glad you asked. A hinted font has, imbedded in the mathematical code that defines the font, hints provided for the print program which allow the font to look better when printed at very small point sizes. What that means in practice is that there is nothing wrong with using Soft-Logik or PostScript fonts on a dot-matrix printer when you are working at large font sizes, but if you are working in text like this, Compugraphic fonts will give better results.

Let's talk now for a minute about the catagories of fonts. This really has nothing in particular to do with PageStream but comes under the heading of general

information. In general, there are five basic catagories of fonts. "Sans serif" fonts are rather plain fonts. They have no embellishments or fancy gee-gaws (a technical term) to complicate their design. They can be excellent for tabular information, small blocks of text or headlines but they tend to become tiring and difficult to read when used for large blocks of text. For articles, use a "serif" font. These fonts have the embellishments lacking on sans serif fonts and are generally easier to read. A "block serif" font is a special category, rarely used. It has none of the easy flow of a serif font and yet it does have embellishments. It should be used sparingly as you would a sans serif font.. "Script" fonts are designed to look as if they were handwritten. They may be ornate or they may look as if I had written them. They are nice in small doses. The last category is the "display" font. These are designed to be used for headlines and for other special purposes where attention getting is called for. Most become nearly illegible at small sizes.

T he Font Manager OK. Let's assume you know which font to use. The first trick you will face is letting PageStream know where to find the fonts. PageStream has a very powerful feature called the "Font Manager". This allows you to have fonts in as many different places as you want (unlike other programs which require all fonts to be in a single drawer). This flexibility is nice for a couple of reasons. First, I like to keep my drawer sizes down to a somewhat manageable size. As of this writing, I have 73

fonts in my system available to PageStream. In all, there are 366 files for those fonts and they occupy 6,233,704 bytes of my hard drive. Drawers of this size are dumb. What I do on my hard drive is keep one drawer for Soft-Logik fonts, one for Compugraphic fonts, and one for PostScript fonts (with a couple of extra drawers thrown in for special fonts). But I also keep another PageStream system on floppy for my Amiga 1000. Here the ability to maintain multiple directories is even more important since it allows me to access all my fonts even though I can only put a small part of them on a single disk. The trick is in how to use the Font Manager. It's really not that difficult.

The Font Manager can be accessed from two places from within PageStream. The first place is from the "Set/Save Paths" item under the "Global" menu. The second place is from the "Fonts/Points" item under the "Style" menu. Before actually entering the Font Manager however, be sure that under the "Set/Save Paths" item of the "Global" menu, you have specified where the default font directory is located and then click on the "Default" button so this information is available each time the program boots. Once this has been accomplished, selecting either of the menu items (Set/Save Paths or Fonts/Points) will bring up a requester for that function. One of the buttons available on either requester is named "Manager". Click on this button and the Font Manager window will appear. On the left side of the Font Manager window is the list of disks and/or drawers that contain the fonts known to PageStream. Click once on one of the drawers and the fonts existing within that drawer are displayed in the box on the right of the Font Manager window. All that is great if you have it already set up but what if you want to add a new directory/disk of fonts? In the lower portion of the window are several buttons. One of them is marked "Add". Click on the Add gadget. You will be taken to a file requester that lists all the files and directories that are in your default font directory. If the directory you want to add is there, just click on it. If it is not there you have to get to it. The quickest way to do that is by repeatedly clicking on the "Parent" gadget until you see it. If the directory you wish to add exists on a different device, keep on clicking. When there is no

The PageStream Font Manager

![Image](1991_04_artifacts/image_000007_61ae31680cf79731b9735d2ecae1d6eac644d4383de3684f331a7b7ed69e0fe4.png)

"parent" directory, the requester will display a list of all the physical volumes available to the system. (NOTE: you should always use the volume name in this way. Never use a device name such as DFO:) Click on the one you want and keep following the path 'til you find the directory you are interested in. Are you there yet? When you find the correct directory, click on it. The file requester will then show you all of the files within the directory. Here is the confusing part. WE DON'T CARE! The fact that the program displays the font files would lead you to believe that there is more required of you. The fact is, you are done. You DON'T need to click on any of the file names. Just click on the "OK" button. PageStream will read all the files in the directory and add the proper ones to the font list. You will find yourself returned to the Font Manager window and on the left you will see that the directory has now been added to the directory list. If you click on the directory name, the names of all the fonts within the directory will appear on the right.

OK. So now we have added a new directory full of fonts. We certainly don't want to do this every time we boot the system. There is a gadget on the left hand side of the Font Manager window labeled "Default". Click on this button and the current device/directory/font-list is saved to the default font directory defined under the Set/Save Paths menu item. Now the next time you boot up PageStream it will read this file and you will be set to go. There is an added advantage to this system as well. Once the list has been saved to disk by clicking on the Default button, PageStream immediately knows the fonts that are available and where to find them. The program does not have to re-read this information. In this way the program can boot much more quickly.

There are two more buttons at the bottom of the Font Manager window that are just as important. Just as it is necessary to tell PageStream when you add a new font directory, it is also important to tell it when something changes. If you remove an entire font disk/directory from your system (perhaps to combine it with another directory), just click on the directory that is no longer there and press the button marked "Remove". The Font Manager window will go away briefly and when it returns the directory will no longer be in the list. If you add or remove a font or a series of fonts from one of your active font directories (as I do on a regular basis), simply click on the disk/directory name that has been updated and click on the button marked "Update" . PageStream will once again go away briefly and when it returns it will have placed the updated directory at the bottom of the list and updated the internal font list. Remember that after deleting or updating a disk/directory in this way, you need to click once again on the Default button to store this updated information away for the next time you boot up.

That's about all I have room for this month. Next month look for a continuation of the discussion on handling text.

## GeoWizard

## C64 Review by Dick Estel From the Newsletter of the Fresno Commodore User Group

T he title screen displayed when you load it says "The Ultimate GEOS Utility" . While that's a somewhat grandiose claim, the author has every right to be pleased with Geo Wizard, and the statement is not far off the mark.

Actually Geo Wizard is a package of utilities, available from Comm-Plex Software for a more than fair $16.50. The author is Jim Collete, GeoRep Jim on Q-Link, who launched his GEOS programming career at age 13 with a font editor written in BASIC. Since then he has upgraded the editor, and Font Editor 2.5 is certainly the ultimate GEOS font editor in my experience. Geo Wizard is one of those programs that multiplies the value of the whole GEOS system immeasurably. I decided after using it for a while that I would not fully appreciate it until I had used it for six months or a year, and I continue to find new features and ways to use it. To give a brief description, Geo Wizard turns all GEOS applications into desk accessories, recovers from some crashes, makes unique screen dumps, and in general gives you control of the system that far exceeds that offered by the original Desk Top provided by Berkeley Softworks.

Desk Accessories are programs (usually small utilities) that can be accessed from within other programs. The major ones are the Photo Manager and Text Manager. While using Geolaint, GeoPublish or Geo Write, you can open the Photo Manager to import artwork into your document. Geo Wizard gives you the capability to operate ANY GEOS program from within any other program and this applies to programs on other disks, and any of three drives. From a practical standpoint, this means that if I want to put together a piece of artwork while working on the newsletter with GeoPublish, I can open GeoPaint, create the artwork, make a photo scrap of it, return to GeoPublish, and paste the scrap into my document. And I can do it even if GeoPaint is on another disk or drive. Of course, if I create a photo scrap on a different disk, I must copy it to the disk I am using. One of the auxiliary programs that comes with Geo Wizard is Mini Desk, a true desk accessory. When you open Mini Desk, you can copy files to and from any of three drives. You can also scratch and rename files. I have used this feature many times to copy a needed Photo Album to my RAM disk. When you close Geo Wizard, instead of waiting for the screen to be re-drawn as with normal desk accessories, you are immediately returned to where you

A third part of the package is Geo WizDump, a screen dump utility. Geo WizDump creates a GeoPaint document or a photo scrap of the screen. Unlike every other such program created for GOS, this one can be operated even while the pointer is on a pull-down window. In the past it was impossible to make a screen dump to illustrate dialogue boxes and pull-down menus, because the pointer had to be moved off the menu to the utility name. And when you move the pointer off a menu, the menu disappears. Geo Wizard operates independently of the pointer position, by pressing down and holding the right mousse button, then clicking the left button. For joystick uses, the left arrow key is pressed and held, followed by a click from the fire button. This activates Geo Wizard, and displays a help screen which list the options available. Pressing the Commodore key plus L allows you to load a program. C=D loads a desk accessory. And C=P dumps the screen to the printer.

One of Geo Wizard's most valuable features for REU users comes into play here. If the screen locks up but the pointer can be moved, opening Geo Wizard allows you to select C=Q and quit to the desk top. Data entered since the last update may be lost, but at least you do not have to reboot the program. Some of the things that you do or create with Geo Wizard are not immediately available. For example, if you modified a Geo Write document from within GeoPublish, the changes would not be effective until you closed and re-opened the document. The photo scraps and GeoPaint files created with Geo WizDump are not even visible on the Desk Top at first (if you create them from the Desk Top). You would need to open GeoPaint using the program icon, and then the filename would be listed. However, a photo scrap created from Geo Wizard is available immediately when you return to your document.

On the negative side, Geo Wizard is not compatible with all GEOS programs. Users have had considerable problems trying to use it with GeoFile and GeoCalc. It is also incompatible with a few other things created by independent programmers. Originally it conflicted with use of the fill pattern feature in GeoPaint but this problem has been eliminated.

Geo Wizard now comes with · Geo WizMover, which allows relocation of the code. The default location seems to be the most reliable, but this allows GEOS programmers to experiment in eliminating the incompatibilities. GeoWizard REQUIRES a RAM expansion unit to operate. If your REU is a 1764, you can't use Geo Wizard and also have a RAM disk; and with the 512K REU you can only use it if you configure your RAMV disk as a 1541 (not a 1571). The optimum use of expanded RAM is normally the largest RAM disk you can have, so Geo Wizard works best if you have a one meg REU or larger.

Once you have experienced Geo Wizard, you can't imagine going back to the old way. Geo Wizard provides a significant upgrade to the GEOS operating system.

## Dinosaur Discovery Kit

Amiga Software Review by Carol Mulligan From the Newsletter of the San Diego Amiga User's Group his delightful educational program combines a coloring book, a story teller and a matching game. It is easy to follow and is perfect for children who cannot yet read. It speaks the necessary instructions aloud and combines pictures along with its text. Once your child becomes familiar with the program's basic features, you can allow them to operate it on their own.

The program starts out by introducing itself. Using the Amiga's built-in speech synthesizer it proudly announces "Zug the Megasaurus presents the Dinosaur Coloring Book". The voice, as those familiar with the Amiga will know, takes some getting used to. Despite this limitation, my three-year-old seemed to be able to understand it pretty well.

After this introduction, "Zug" presents three options: the coloring book, the story teller, and the matching game. The coloring book contains a series of dinosaur pictures waiting to be painted. Zug suggests what section of the picture to paint but after that it is up to the child's imagination. They are free to make the water purple and the dinosaur yellow. This option also gives little tidbits of information about the particular dinosaur being colored.

actions, and other elements to create stories. Your child will have a lot of fun doing this. Unfortunately there are only three story lines available, so your child may lose interest after a few tries.

The matching game is similar to the television classic, Concentration. Unlike the story teller, it has many options. Children can choose to play by themselves or against the computer. When playing against the computer they can make the computer act dumb or smart. Another option is to make the cards on the screen either large or small. The range of selections are likely to keep children entertained for quite a while.

Although the Dinosaur Discovery Kit is intended for preschoolers, my 7-year-old enjoys playing it once in a while.

In addition to these options, the Dinosaur Discovery Kit can work with your printer to give children permanent copies of their accomplishments. This allow them to produce things that they can show to their friends and relatives. They can print their dinosaur pictures, and their stories (using both words and pictures), as well as certificates that say that they have won the match game. Printing will probably require the parents' help.

The story teller option lets the child choose places,

## Amiga By-The-Loop Garry Wordelman

Here we are in April already and time for April showers. Hopefully, this will not detain you from attending our great monthly meetings. For starters, just look at some of the interesting things that took place at our March meeting.

First of all, Harold Williams demonstrated this month's ShareWare product called IconJ. This is a utility similar to IconX in our library, but without some of IconX's drawbacks. The purpose of IconJ is to create an icon which will attach to and run a program originally designed to run only in a CLI window. IconJ sounds like a great utility. Why not try it and if you like it and can use it, than support by contributing to our ShareWare jar.

Second, Dave Owens gave a short review of the Workbench menu presentation was designed to help a new user become more familiar with their Amiga and how it works. Dave items and their functions. His and others will continue to give short help sessions at our meeting in the future. Any suggestions or ideas of things you would like to know more about will definitely be considered a s future topics.

Machines. Don gave us his viewpoints as he sees computer sales from inside Commodore and in the future. He stated that he feels that the outlook for Commodore is excellent and that the company will only move up with an improving outlook. He pointed out that Commodore has sold computer packages to several Texas universities including North Texas, Texas A&amp;M and the Univ. of Houston. They have even sold some Amigas to Hewlett Packard and "big blue" ", IBM, because of the Amigas special capabilities. He also said that the CDTV will be the educational system of the future. Don pointed out that the 68040 CPU chip is still in beta testing and he could not be pinned down in predicting its release. He also gave us an idea of what to expect in the Amiga 3000T (Tower) system. He said it is basically an Amiga 3000 system put in a vertical box with lots of space or slots for expansion and accessories. Overall, his presentation was most informative.

I hope to see you at our next meeting in April where things promise to be even better.

Spring has sprung, and our chapter is blossoming... I noticed more ladies than · usual in attendance. Was it bring-a-date-toMCCC night, or were you gals true Amigaphiles yourselves? Glad to see you! Hope you'll be back! With a lot of guests in attendance, our president Craig Bird gave a I quick run down on the benefits of membership: access to the 1000+ disks in our Club Library, a fine 2line BBS with recently expanded 190mb on-line storage, club discounts at local stores, etc., and of course this outstanding newsletter you're holding! Speaking of memberships... check your mailing label. Is yours soon to expire? Renew now, so you'll be sure to hear about the latest events, like our Spring Thing which we hope will not be held 10 feet under water, where it was unfortunately scheduled last year.

Our Shareware Pick of the Month was ICONJ, ably presented by Harold Williams. This nifty tool expands on the capabilities of ICONX (which comes with your Amiga). ICONJ can set up a CLI program to be run via an icon, but unlike ICONX (which requires a separate script file on disk), ICONJ enables you to imbed your script in the icon itself. Your script can even be interactive, for run-time choices. AND you can create a complex, lengthy script in your favorite text editor THEN load it into the icon. ICONJ is available (with documentation, of course!) on one of our club Superdisks. Remember, if you can use and enjoy

a Shareware or Freeware product, say "Thank You!" by contributing to the author at our meetings each month.

Bits &amp; Pieces: We heard discussions of the rules (less) and prices (more) for buying Amiga products with a student discount. Yes, you CAN buy peripherals separately! There were good buys on hardware and software odds and ends for sale by members on hand... come prepared to browse or bring your "spares" to share with us! One member who has had his left mouse button wear out once too often has found a source for the part and ordered a BUNCH of 'em for 45 cents. Rather than replacing your mouse (very expensive), inquire about these widgets at

Topics got so varied that Craig asked if anyone had anything related to the AMIGA to discuss! (Aw, come on, Craig..!) Nobody called Karl Zettl about his offer of a great group discount on custom-made Amiga equipment cases. He's giving you one more chance to express interest at (214) 339-0474.

My apologies to everyone for not submitting my minutes in time last issue. I

have been sick plus I had a few mistakes on the late entry. Amiga West last month was fortunate to have Scott Lamb as our featured speaker. Scott told us how he started in programming and with the Commodore computer. Scott went over the Video Toaster and told us how he was a self-taught programmer. He then went into a discussion about CD-TV. From all that he told us this will be a wonderful addition to the Commodore line.

After Scott's discussion Jack Smith, our chapter president, handed out free copies of George Broussard's Rings of Zon. Thanks, Jack and George! Amazing Computers handed out door prizes (Bill Mee won Financial Plus software). "MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND" t-shirts were also given away. Thank you, Amazing, for your support!

This month our Feature Speaker was David Johnson of Fort Worth's Amazing Computers. David

presented the "UX-3000", the Commodore 5.4 UNIX-SYSTEM. David told us how Commodore made this system to be a "Very Vanilla" UNIX so it would be compatible with most all UNIX operating systems. This is the first UNIX system using the Motorola CPU. At present there are two Amiga UNIX systems: The UXB-3000 (5 meg. RAM 100 meg. h/d) and the UXD3000 (9 meg. RAM 200 meg. h/d). Availability is NOW so anyone needing a UNIX system stop by Amazing Computers and check it out. See everyone next
