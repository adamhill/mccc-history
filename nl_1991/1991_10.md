## PGA Tour Golf

## The most impressive golf game yet by Bill Raecke

GA Tour Golf, from Electronic Arts, is the latest in my system. Mean 18, World Tour Golf and World Class Leader Board have all come and gone. They were summarily eclipsed by Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design (JNUG) which I reviewed in December of 1990. I'm going to proceed with this review in two sections. First I'll tell you a little about PGA Tour Golfwhat some of its features are and how it plays - and then I'Il compare it to the reigning champ, JNUG, and see how it stacks up.

First, the installation. If you want to play from a floppy, just click on the icon and get on with it. If you want to install the game on your hard drive, there is a hard drive installation program provided that makes the job painless. The game is password protected - the most reasonable way of protecting a game - so you are free to make a backup copy of your purchase.

When the game is started, you are first taken to the Pro Shop where you can select your game options. Options are selected via menu items. The menus don't work like normal Amiga menus. What we have here is an obvious port from an MS-DOS machine and so the menus work as menus ordinarily would on an IBM. But at least there are menus. They're not too hard to get used to. There are a lot of options available, but the only ones I'm going to mention are the two types of games. You can play a practice round or a tournament. The games vary only slightly. In a practice round you can play the holes in any order and you are allowed to take a mulligan. (A mulligan allows you to repeat a shot for practice. The extra shot is not added to your score.) When you select a game, the next step is to determine how many players there are. You are allowed from one to four golfers. Any of the golfers can be computer controlled. For each golfer you supply a name, you select whether amateur or professional tees will be used, and you select the clubs to take along. (You are limited to fourteen clubs.) There is no selection for the sex of the golfer. The game assumes that all golfers are men. (Are they allowed to do tha! these days?!) The next step is to select a course to play. Included with the game are four excellent courses from real life. Make your selection and the fun begins.

The first thing you will see is a layout of the entire course. The next thing you will see will knock your socks off. PGA Tour Golf provides an aerial fly-by of every hole. On the screen is a small rectangular window showing the course. In the bottom portion of the screen is a hint from the pros on how the hole is best played. Imagine yoursel: in a helicopter. (Bell, no doubt.) In the window, the firs view of the course is as though you were in that helicopter, approaching the green. You will fly over the flag, then the helicopter will tilt back as it changes direction, and you will begin flying backward - away from the hole, down the fairway, toward the tee. As you approach the tee, the rectangular window slowly opens giving a more panoramic view of things. All the while there is some very impressive music playing in the background. The effect is awesome. As impressive as it is, the aerial fly-by has a practical aspect as well. That flight backward down the fairway lets you see where every water hazard and every bunker is located. This is great stuff. You may put your socks back on now.

After the fly-by you are shown a standard aerial view of the hole. Next, it's time for that tee shot. The game play here is rather standard. There is the normal, threeclick power bar to control your swing and there is the normal cross-hair to aim your shot. The recommended club selection is performed automatically although you can change it to allow for wind conditions, lie, or simply preference by clicking on the name of the selected club. One particularly nice feature is the number that appears at the high end of the power bar. It indicates the normal maximum distance for that club. Things may vary depending on conditions, and distance will certainly vary depending on your stroke, but it provides a nice reference

point. One thing that is definitely not standard is the wind indicator. With most games, what you get is a direction pointer and a relative strength meter. With PGA Tour Golf the wind indicator is a pointer with a speed indicator below it that shows wind speed in MPH. And it changes! As you are trying to get your shot ready, the wind speed and direction will fluctuate. It makes the game more difficult and more realistic.

Take your shot. Now the ball is in the air. Time for the next trick PGA Tour Golf has up its electronic sleeve. When the ball is on its way down, the view will shift. Instead of watching your ball disappear into the distance you will find yourself just beyond the point where it will land, watching it approach. This may not be very realistic but it sure is a neat effect. The second shot is just another like the tee shot - except there are a couple of special strokes available that could come in handy. A "punch shot" can be used in when the ball is half buried in sand or rough. The ball will not travel as far but you're not as likely to flub it. The "chip shot" can be used when close to the green. The ball won't travel far and won't go high into the air.

Greens in PGA Tour Golf are not just flat surfaces that tilt in one direction or the other. They are undulating surfaces that tilt in varying directions and degrees depending on where you are and where your shot has to travel. To give you a feel for the terrain, you are taken to a special screen that shows the green as a contour grid pattern. Another thing worth noting on this screen is the distance above or below the hole. Expressed in inches, that figure helps you determine how hard to hit the ball. It is on this screen that you set up the direction of the shot. When you are done you are taken back to a screen similar to that used on the tee and the fairway to actually putt. The power bar works the same as before - the wind indicator is gone.

A word of warning putting is difficult.

ow it's time for that comparison. Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design - how do they measure up? First up, graphics. PGA has that knockout fly-by. JNUG can't compete with that. But beyond that, the graphics used on the actual game-play screens are better in JNUG. In PGA, everything looks flat. JNUG uses shading and detailed drawing techniques to simulate hills and valleys. In addition, the trees and backgrounds used in JNUG are much more varied. PGA's background is always a mountain range - even when the golf course is in Florida.

How about game-play on the fairways? Here, again, JNUG has the edge. PGA not only looks flat, it plays flat. Terrain has no effect on the ball unless it hits an obstacle. In JNUG the hills and valleys that it depicts on the screen can affect how the ball travels thereby making the game more challenging and more realistic.

Game-play on the greens is excellent in both games. Each uses a similar technique. In PGA, you are taken to a contour grid map to help you "read" the green. In JNUG, the contour grid is laid over the green as you play it. Both methods are effective. It's a draw.

One other thing PGA left out - the course designer. With JNUG there is an excellent course design program included. That means that there are many public domain courses with which to expand your system and, of course, you can develop your own as well (a task that is much more demanding than it would seem). With PGA you have the original four courses and whatever others you purchase.

Now, all this probably sounds as if I don't like PGA Tour Golf. That is NOT the case at all. The fact is, I have both PGA and JNUG installed on my hard drive. That helicopter flight makes up for a lot. And the fact of the matter is that both games are a lot of fun to play. The only reason I felt the comparison was necessary is that when JNUG came on the scene, all the competition was blown out of the water. That is not the case with PGA Tour Golf. Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design is still a strong contender. But if you want something that will make your non-Amiga owning friends take notice, show them PGA Tour Golf.

## Understanding Your AMIGA

Hard disk management by Harold Williams

¡ he Amiga 2000HD, Amiga 2500 and all Amiga 11h0 Ange 90 and 90 d no and bad ard The Amiga 500 and 2000 do not include a hard drive, but it is quite easy to add one. Having a hard drive provides three benefits. First, a hard drive has huge storage capacity compared with a floppy drive. The Amiga floppy drive has just under 1 megabyte of storage. The smallest hard drives have ten times that, and the most common hard drives have 50 to 100 megabytes of storage. The second benefit is speed. The speed increase depends on the particular hard drive and the adapter card, but always it is astonishing. Even a "slow" hard drive will seem turbocharged to someone accustomed to floppy drives. I performed a simple test to compare the speed of a floppy to my hard drive. First, I loaded DPaint III (Electronic Arts) from the original floppy and timed it with a stop watch. The time to the first screen was 1 minute 36 sèconds. Loading DPaint from my hard drive (Quantum 105S and Microbotics Hard Frame) took 1.5 seconds. That's a speed increase of over 60 times. The third benefit of having a hard drive is its immediate availability. The hard drive will boot the Amiga automatically and all its software and data will be immediately available. Okay, so a hard drive is a wonderful thing, but the large storage capacity of a hard drive creates a few problems. The problems are associated with organization, file maintenance and data security.

Organizing the file structure on a hard drive requires some advanced planning. Even with some careful thought, and advice from friends and "experts" you are likely to eventually discover that your initial plan was not ideal. When you attempt to organize your hard drive, realize that eventually you will probably want to reorganize. The first decision you will have to face is the number of partitions. Partitioning your hard drive will create what will appear to your Amiga as separate disks. There are several advantages to having multiple partitions. First, partitions allow you to categorize your software and data. I have my hard drive divided into five partitions, named Workbench, Applications, Art, Data, and Fun&amp;Games. These partitions work well for me, but they would not necessarily be right for you. Partitioning also simplifies the task of maintaining security backups of the software and data on your system (more on this later). Because of the way I have partitioned my drive and the way I use my software, I know that my most critical files are all in the Data partition. My Data partition contains all the things I create; Imagine animations, DPaint

![Image](1991_10_artifacts/image_000005_ea4b737e7ba15bdf0e6c5201ae06ce7a3058a1ba0cab39f3bb04b4b9b1e8113d.png)

pictures, CanDo applications, or articles like this one. My other partitions contain the programs I use like Imagine, DPaint and CanDo. I'm not terribly concerned about backing up the programs, but my work, the things I create, are of great concern. Since all these files are in one partition it is easy to maintain backups. Partitioning also reduces the possibility of losing all data on the hard drive as a result of some catastrophe. Some types of drive failures will cause loss of all data on a disk (the system will usually present an error message like "Error validating disk..." or "Not a DOS disk in unit 0".) Since partitions are treated as a "disk" the data on your other partitions would not be affected.

Another benefit of partitioning your hard drive is the reduced stress on the system because of the smaller number of files in any one place. Scanning a directory of a bazillion files is a time consuming task. Dividing the files up by using partitions reduces this problem. Lastly, a partitioned hard drive is easier to reorganize and optimize than an un-partitioned drive. Depending primarily on the software that came with your controller the default cohere to a or a parison, als liede partition or two equal sized partitions. Neither of these is likely to be the best possible setup for you. There simply isn't a "best" setup. Consider the total size of your hard drive, the size of the programs that will be placed in a partition, and the size of the data files you will create. Plan for some extra room in each partition. My partitions range from 10 megabytes to 25 megabytes. Remember that the primary reasons for partitions are to help you categorize your programs and data, and simplification of the backup process. You should also consider the down side of partitioning. Each partition that you create will use up a small amount of RAM (each drive must have a buffer) and will create a task that uses a small amount of CPU. Okay, here are some home grown guidelines to help you decide. Rule #1: Avoid partitions larger than 40 megabytes because they take too long to backup and can easily hold the above mentioned "bazillion files". Rule #2: Avoid partitions smaller than 10 megabytes because they won't be worth the extra overhead. Rule #3: Use at least three partitions. One for Workbench, another for programs and a third for data files. Rule #4: Don't use more than six partitions unless you have a very large drive. Rule #5: Remember that whatever you decide, you will surely discover, that it wasn't the best choice. Rule #6: Don't take these rules too seriously.

If you have decided to partition or re-partition your

hard drive remember that this process destroys all the data on the affected partitions and, depending on your host adapter card, may affect other partitions. If your drive currently contains files you must have a suitable backup before beginning the partitioning procedure.

Whether you use one partition or more you will want to use drawers to further divide and categorize your programs and data. My Data partition, for example, has drawers named Imagine, DPaint, CanDoDecks, and TextFiles. Drawers in all the partitions are important to keep things reasonably organized. Even drawers within

Hard drive backup software can be used to protect your valuable data from loss and to remove fragmentation from your hard drive.

drawers are necessary. Try to avoid going more than three drawers deep.

Backing up a hard drive is an important process to prevent the loss of data. If you are working from a floppy disk and some catastrophe occurs, you are only in danger of losing the programs and data contained on the floppy. When you are working from a hard drive the same thing is true. The difference is losing less than one megabyte and losing 50 or 100 or more megabytes of data. What you should backup and how often you should do backups is dependent on your system and how you use it. If you have data on your hard drive that you cannot afford to lose, then it is time for a backup. Backing up your hard drive is best done with a custom backup program. Simply copying files to a disk is not usually satisfactory. I use Quarterback (Central Coast Software), but there are several other excellent commercial backup programs and MRBackUp (Mark Rinfret) is available from the MCCC library. Remember that it is not terribly important to maintain backups of your software. You have the originals on floppy and can always reinstall them. I do keep a backup of my software because restoring those files would be much simpler from a backup than going through the install procedures. Each time I add a new piece of software to a partition, I don't feel compelled to create a fresh backup. However, if I have created new animations, or pictures or text files, I am concerned about the potential loss of my work. Backup software will usually allow you a multitude of options in determining the files within a partition to backup. I prefer to always perform a full backup. Any other form of backup leaves you with a real headache if you discover that you need to restore the entire partition. At present, there are two types of media that are commonly used for storing backups. Floppy disks are most commonly used because no extra hardware is required and floppies are relatively cheap. Streaming tape devices are superior to floppies in convenience and speed, but are fairly expensive. It is also possible to do backups to other hard drives and removable media devices like the Syquest and Ricoh drives. Remember, if you can't afford to lose it, then back it up.

A hard drive also requires constant clean-up of files that are no longer needed. The large capacity of a hard drive means that it is easy to collect a large amount of junk. The best way to keep your hard drive cleared of unneeded and unwanted files is to use a "directory utility" like Directory Opus (INOVAtronics), or SID (shareware from Timm Martin). These programs perform a wide variety of tasks involved with manipulating files. In terms of hard drive clean-up, they allow you to easily browse through the files on your hard drive and delete files that are not needed. If you do a massive clean-up of a partition, you might consider also performing a fresh backup of that partition. A word of caution here. If you just deleted a bunch a files, it is possible that you inadvertently deleted files that you meant to keep. Your old backup should have those files. If you now do a fresh backup and are re-using your old backup disks, you are wiping out the backup that would save your bacon! I recommend maintaining two sets of backup disks (or tapes) for each partition and rotating them.

The process of repeatedly adding files and deleting files from a hard disk will eventually cause some fragmentation (files will be split into small chunks scattered about on the drive) of the files. Fragmentation is not a severe problem but will cause a decrease in drive performance. There are two ways to eliminate fragmentation. There are special software packages that perform drive optimization. These programs interrogate the structure of the files on your hard drive and move the files to eliminate fragmentation and improve the general performance of the drive. These programs generally work very slowly unless the partition has a lot of empty space. Partitions with a lot of free space are not usually fragmented. A much simpler solution is to use your backup software to de-fragment your drive. The process is simple, although a little scary. Do a full backup of the partition you wish to de-fragment. If your backup software has the ability to validate the backup, then run the validation to be absolutely certain your backup is good. Now the scary part... format the partition (a quick format will do). The partition will now be empty. Now, restore all the files from the backup. Your partition will be completely de-fragmented. If you use a partition for data like I do, this is the partition that is most likely to suffer from fragmentation of files. Since this is also the partition you would backup most often, this procedure can be occasionally included as part of a normal backup.

There are a couple of freely distributable utility programs that every hard drive owner should keep near at hand. DiskSalv (Dale Haynie) and FixDisk (Werner Guenther) are utilities that will attempt to recover data from a damaged disk. Most problems of this nature are resolved by re formatting the partition. These two utilities can frequently recover most, if not all, of the data before you format the partition. Both of these utilities are available from the MCCC library.

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks by Bill Raecke

This is one of those little utilities that may not be for everyone - but if you can use it, you're really going to love it. What it does is modify your system so that the CPU is used for some blitter operations instead of the blitter chip - only those operations where there will be a speed up. An accelerated Amiga (either 68020 or 68030 or 68040) is required. What you get when you install it is a system that works noticeably faster for some operations. l'ext scrolling is considerably faster. Especially nice is the effect it has on a multiple bit-plane scrolling text window (such as on a terminal program). The system blitter can only move one bit-plane at a time which results in a flashing display. With CPUBlit installed, all the bitplanes can be moved at once. The result is that text scrolls more quickly AND more smoothly. I have been using CPUBlit for several weeks now on my system and have had no problems at all. If your Amiga is supercharged, take a look at this one. It's on MCCCA 338.

## Adobe Fonts

This month, as usual, we have a number of fonts available for use with PageStream. This month's additions are Postscript Type 1 fonts - and there are some real winners here. In particular, be sure to check out "Goudy Medieval" and "Griffen Dingbats" on MCCCA \_335; and "Andesite" and "Mac Humaine" on MCCC1338.

## Goudy Medieval ANDESITE

## PageStream Drivers

Also of interest to users of PageStream is the set of new import drivers for Pagestream 2.1. Everything trom the IFF to the GIF import module has been redone with new features, fixes, etc. They can be found on MCCCA 335.

## Clipart

And once again, for PageStream users, there is a nice collection of clipart. MCCC-A\_335 has a collection of six clips and MCCC-A\_336 has another twelve. Most of these are in Adobe Illustrator format - a type of encapsulated Postscript. Worth noting is that with the improved import drivers (above) for PageStream, Illustrator clips are imported as VIEWABLE and EDITABLE objects.

While we're on the subject of commercial programs, users of Jack Nicklaus Unlimited Golf will want to obtain the two new courses on MCCC-A \_336. "Westridge" is a particularly nice course with lots of water.

## LZ ver 1.92 by Jonathan Forbes

Our shareware selection of the month in August was LZ. That being the case, you might wonder why it's here again. Well, there's a new version, that's why. For the uninitiated, LZ is the best archive/unarchive utility going. This version removes all the blocks that used to prevent archiving certain file lengths so that it is now a fully functioning program. Also new to this version is the addition of the .LHA compression algorithm for even smaller archives. It's on MCCC-A\_335.

## MegaBall by Ed Mackey

Remember the old game of Breakout? Well, MegaBall is the latest program in that tradition. What you have is a pattern of bricks in the upper part of the screen, a paddle that can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen, and a ball that you have to keep from falling off

the bottom of the screen. A simple concept that probably everyone is familiar with. What sets Megaball apart are the excellent graphics, the knockout music, and the price. MegaBall is on a par with many commercial games. And to make it even better, for a small shareware donation you can get BoardEd to make your own screens to play on. Be sure to check this one out. It's on MCCC-A\_339.

## Husker DU by Stephen Roms

If you like Tetris or any of its clones, you'll probably like this game. But Husker DU is NOT just a Tetris clone. You have eight columns to build. And you build those columns by stacking ten bricks on each base provided to you. The trick is, no two bricks in a column can be colored the same. If you accidentally place two identically colored bricks in the same column, the entire column disappears. Then you get to start the column over again. The game is highly addicting. This one can be found on MCCC-A\_340.

## The C64 &amp; VCR

by Bill Hale From the newsletter of the New Mexico Commodore Users Group t our December meeting i gave a presentation oI A do asia the moden and cla video movies. The camcorder and VCR I was using were the 8mm format but the program I was demonstrating, Home Video Producer by Epyx Software, will work for a VHS VCR as well. The C64 and the C128 in 40 column mode generates the same video as your TV and VCR uses, therefore you can record the output of your C64/128 onto a video cassette tape. This makes it possible to add titles and graphics to your home videos by using a character generator you wrote or one of the many graphics programs in the disk library. By connecting the audio output of the computer to your VCR, you can use a music program to your home video movie. If you are not into home video movie-making you can use your computer to make music video tapes of your favorite computer music programs. This way you do not have to load a program in your computer just to be entertained by computer music and graphics.

The big question is how to connect the computer to your VCR? If you have a 1702 monitor it is very simple -

C64 and the C128 and found there are resistors that allow the video cables to be combined safely. Also, I have made this connection with my computer when I was using a 1702 monitor and had no problems. The color signal can be improved by adding a resistor capacitor filter, however the slight improvement will not be noticed when you play back the tape.

If you have a 1902 type monitor that has special forty column input cable you will have to make your own cable to connect your computer to your VCR. Two items have to be purchased - a six-foot long shielded phono cable, RS 42-2367 (2.45), and a five pin DIN plug, RS 274-003 (1.69). Now cut the cable in the middle, separate the center conductors and the shields, solder one center conductor to pin 4, the other center conductor to pin 3, and the two shields to pin 2. If you are not experienced at soldering, have someone do it for you. The pins on a DIN plug are small and are numbered in an odd sequence. Look in the connector explanation section of your computer reference manual. The cable connected to pin 4 of the DIN plug will carry a standard color video signal that contains

But at least Death doesn't get worse each year luminance, color, and sync signals. The cable connected to pin 3 will carry the audio signal. Be sure and label these cables "A" for audio and "V" for video. If you put the video signal in the audio input you will sound. If your VCR is a stereo model you cal eed both channel with audio by using a the let cereal on the will generated.

just connect the audio and video cables to your VCR instead of your monitor and connect the VCR outputs to your monitor, or set your VCR to feed a signal on channel 3 or 4 to your TV and tune the TV to the selected channel. The C64 and the C128 have two cables for the video signals - one carries the luminance and sync information and the other carries the color information. To record in color the VCR has to have both of these signals. This can be made possible by a trip to your local Radio Shack store. By using the RS42-2436 (2.69) "Y" adapter you can connect both video signals to your VCR. I lave checked thi schematics on both thi

## On-Line Services

PeopleLink is gone - but Portal and others are here by Bill Raecke ecently the Amiga on-line community was stunned ›PeopleLink offered a huge Amiga software library and a very active message base. But almost before we had time to cry foul it was announced that PeopleLink's Amiga Zone was moving to Portal. Portal is a service similar to PeopleLink but with the addition of such features as a contentin real set me fend an of Portal. My initial response was mixed -- the service is very different from the other services I have tried .. but once I spent a little time with it and learned how to configure my session properly, I really liked it.

Of course, the fee structure doesn't tell you all you need to know. As a prospective user you need to know which service will better meet YOUR needs and desires. I have chosen several catagories that I feel most users will

But rather than just mourn the passing of PeopleLink or give a plug to the new kid on the block (Portal), I decided that this would be an opportune time to pass along information concerning the four major services. The accompanying chart gives the current fee structures for a 2400 BAUD user. 9600 BAUD service is offered by some... but the hourly rates are MUCH higher.

be interested in and I have given grades based on my subjective opinions. I have given no grades to BIX because I am not a member of BIX and so I have no first hand experience. What I have been told of BIX is that it is THE place to go if you need technical assistance. The Who's Who of Amiga development is available there on a regular basis.

To join BIX - Call 800-225-4129 (modem). At the first prompt, enter BIX (without the quotes). At the name prompt, enter BIX.AMIGA. On-line prompts will lead you from there through the sign-up procedure.

To join GEnie - Call 800-638-8369 (modem). After connect, enter HHH (without the quotes). At the U# prompt, enter XTX99587,CPUREPT. On-line prompts will take over from there.

To join Compuserve - Call 800-848-8990 (voice). Someone will be glad to help you become a member.

To join Portal - Call the local Telenet access number, 817-332-6794. At the Terminal prompt, enter D1 (without the quotes). At the prompt, enter C PORTAL. On-line prompts will take you from there. I don't have the (214) Telenet access number, but you can call Portal direct at 408-725-0561 (modem).

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Garry Wordelman

We had about 32 members and visitors at our September chapter meeting. Among those were two lucky people. Pete Goad won the software package Laser Jet Fonts donated by Bill Heilman. Also, Brian Dooley won Hyper Helper donated by INOVAtronics (last month's program sponsor).

The September ShareWare is called Mostra. It is a graphics utility used for viewing all types of pictures and animation files. It also enables one to select several pic files and view them sequentially at the click of a button. The pic icon file can also be edited or changed for almost any purpose. You can all find Mostra in our club SuperDisk Library.

Our program for September was presented by David Johnson from ANSOFT Data Systems of Ft. Worth. He demonstrated and talked about some of the many products that help you use Imagine by Impulse. Note that Imagine is a powerful 3-D image and animation program. He illustrated Surface Master which allows one to select and change the surface characteristics and appearance of an object. He discussed Map Master which enables one to map and change the surface of 3-D objects. He also demoed The Buddy System which will enable you to install Imagine and also provides on-line pull-down help menus and descriptions. He also mentioned The Imagine Companion, a book guide for using Imagine. Overall, these packages can make Imagine an even more powerful product, as well as improve one's creativity immensely. David gave a very interesting and informative presentation.

Please make a note to attend next month's presentation by Jody Reimers on Tuesday, October 8th.

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

Our October meeting featured a different kind of presentation. Rather than seeing the latest software or hardware available, we had a "how to" presentation. Harold Williams, our inimitable chapter vice president, gave an excellent presentation on installing software on your hard drive. All difficulty levels were touched on from the simple "drag the icon to the hard drive" installation to those requiring complex installations including "assigns" and modification of the startup-sequence. Thanks, Harold, for an informative talk.

In October we will be pleased to welcome INOVAtronics to show us their latest. Directory Opus, their latest offering (and best directory utility currently available) is sure to be featured. And don't be surprised if we get a quick look at some of the latest features to be added to CanDo. INOVAtronics never fails to put on an entertaining demonstration. Don't miss it.

While we're on the subject of not missing the meeting, I need to remind everyone that the October meeting will NOT be held on the

Trick or Treat... and we got both! At our September meeting, Mark Henry from The Edge showed us all the new tricks in Deluxe Paint IV, and it was a real treat. We saw the new Spare Brush, and the Metamorph feature, where one shape was made to magically become another (colors, details, and all) over a few frames of GENERATED animation. We saw a sort of watercolor feature called "mix" where one color picks up a bit of another as the brush passes by, and a fancy new artist's palette for blending your own colors "like real life" , in addition to the regular slide-bar mixing option. Now there's an "animation control bar" available, like having a VCR controller in your hand, and (one of my favorite features) the "lightbox", which gives you shadows of previous (or upcoming) images (in color!) like the onionskin feature in Disney Animation. Want a simple 3-D effect? How about a separate backmiddle- and foreground that are independently locked in: instant layering. And for looking through the windows at the world you've created, a brush can be made transparent to any degree you desire. Perhaps if I'm VERY good, Santa will upgrade me (for maybe $67). If he doesn't, I'll still have more fun with my Deluxe Paint IIl after our October meeting, when Mary Johnson promises to show us some Neat Stuff you can do with DPIII. Look forward to animation, titling, special effects, and all sorts of things that are really special but not everyone knows you can do!

## CHAPTER NEWS

Tidbytes: Brett Hester's Toaster SIG is expected to meet 10/27 at Metropolitan. Call him at (214) 2335493 for details. (Call him anyway... it's his birthday!) The SIG is planning to put out a 12-page newsletter with toaster "recipes" keep a library, etc. He sez "We Do Objects". . (Sounds kinky to me, but I don't have a toaster.) Other News: ProWrite 3.2 is due soon, ($20 update), and will support postscript. Directory Opus from INOVAtronics is out, $59.95 retail, $48 at The Edge. (Remember your members' discount at our dealers, too!) We heard rumors of a 20-meg floppy drive, a cross between a standard floppy and an optical disk. It's faster than a floppy, slower than a hard drive, and due out in a few months. New Word: "floptical drive". Cute. Lost and Found Department: Brett is looking for an animation that came out around the time DPAINT III did, with male and female figures walking (to help you design your animations). Anybody seen it? Down Side of the News: Applied Engineering plans no further R&amp;D on Amiga hardware, so look for no more new stuff from them.

There were over 60 people in attendance at the meeting, so if there's a magazine, TV ad, commentary, newsletter, or rumorunder-a-rock, SOMEBODY will likely have seen it. So if you wanna know if XYZ version Il runs under release

3.4A of ABC VI, come ask us. We'll vote on it. Doorprizes this month: five $10 gift certificates, Amiga Action magazine (with disk), Amiga Games magazine, and a nice Media Box, all from the Edge; and three Mystery Prizes from the game selection at Metropolitan. And now a plug for Plano to all you closet Trekkies out there... Take my Worf, Please! Yep, Michael Dorn himself will be at the Star Trek Convention at the Plano Convention Center, October 19th &amp; 20th. See you there!

Brad Dumler came well prepared for an excellent demonstration of the Dialogue 128, an 80 column program by Gary Farmaner from Voyager He used Aprotec Minimodem, 2400 baud to show that a proper utility program in 128 mode can provide any 128 Commodore computer with all of the necessary download and upload protocol capabilities for telecommunication needs. Swiftlink cartridge is in the same class as Bob's Term Pro which sets the standard by which all the other telecommunication programs try to follow. Swiftlink is not only fast enough and feature-rich but goes further and allows the use of a mouse which, of course, increases speed and ease of use. Brad used the RS-232

interface with Swiftlink.

Also, Q-Link, GEnie (GM) and Ramlink were shown to an enthusiastic audience of new members, guests and regulars who also enjoyed Glen Herring's hospitality at his cottage.

Congratulations to the Foster McCowans' on the arrival of a new baby girl (6 1/2 Ibs.) on September 10.

## HEB Robyn Wilson

The meeting for October consisted of attending METCOM 91 which was (or will be) held on Saturday, October 5th. I hope to have (or will) see y'all out there showing support for our Commodore systems.

That is not the only support we need to see. The November meeting is for choosing our new officers for 1992. There needs to be good membership attendance for voting. There are some openings for offices for anyone willing to take a challenge. As always, anyone needing help will receive it.

Along with the voting, a drive or more, time permitting, will e done. It is going to be a very good demo. You can fix them on your ow if needed. Installation of chips may be another facet of the demo.
