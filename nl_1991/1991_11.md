## Directory Opus

A breakthrough in directory utilities by Bill Raecke t's always been somewhat astonishing to me that the \_ sharea fongs have ben sing an ol or shareware offerings. I have been using such tools for years - and have never had to visit my local dealer to pick one up. The latest and greatest has always been available on the club BBS and in the MCCC library. It was, therefore, with a great deal of hesitation that I bit the bullet and paid good money for INOVAtronics' Directory Opus. Having said that, let me get the big question out of the way. Is it worth it? You bet... and then some!

But before I begin discussing Directory Opus in detail, I need to begin with a very brief explanation of what a directory utility is. This is for those who are new to the club, new to the Amiga, or both. A directory utility is simply a tool that can be used to work with the various files on your computer's disks in a much easier fashion. Directory utilities AlL allow you to copy, move or delete files, to make directories, to show pictures, to listen to sounds, to read text files, and more. And they all work with the click of a button. To read a text file with most directory utilities, you highlight the file name to be read with a click of the mouse button and then click on the gadget named "read". With SID or Directory Opus, simply double-clicking on the file name will allow you to read the file. Some directory utilities have built-in functions for performing actions like showing pictures (good for people who are running a floppy disk based system) and some use the external function of your choice (a much more versatile option for those with hard drives). Since I just described what ALL directory utility programs do, you may be wondering what makes Directory Opus so much better. The answer to that question will comprise the bulk of this article - but in a word, configurability is what sets it apart from the crowd. In short, you tell Directory Opus what YOU want it to do... and it does it. Kind of a do-it-yourself kit for those of us who are never satisfied.

Back to the beginning. Let's talk about system . requirements. Directory Opus is big. In fact, size may be its major drawback. On disk the program is 235,752 bytes. That's a quarter of a megabyte. And that doesn't include the external help file, the configuration program and file, and a few other assorted support files. In all, be ready to sacrifice about 561,000 bytes of disk storage. For the sake of comparison, SID is only half the size of Directory Opus and the only support file required is a configuration file. Assuming that you have the necessary disk space to set aside, the installation is painless. There is an installation program that actually works and there are no "Assigns" or other complications.

When you fire it up, Directory Opus looks much like other directory utilities. There are two windows to show two directories at once. Either window may act as the "source" directory. Across the top of each directory window is a bar showing the volume name and the number of bytes free in that volume. Across the bottom of each directory window is a string gadget showing the current full path of the directory being displayed. Just next to each of those gadgets is a pair of arrows. These arrows will scroll though the list of buffered directories. (In Directory Opus, directories are placed in buffers for easy re-access - with no re-reading of data from the disk itself. Even such things as highlighted files are saved.) Between those sets of arrows is a set of four mini-gadgets with functions that the author considered important. Along the bottom of the window is a set of buttons representing many of the built-in functions that can be performed. Directory Opus comes configured with four rows pre-defined. The left-hand column of gadgets is actually a list of system devices to use when selecting a directory to work with. There is also a full set of menus with more functions. Across the very top of the window is a status line. It normally contains a count of the number of directories, files, and bytes in the active directory (the two numbers represent the selected and total counts) but is also used to display general information. Along the very bottom of the window is a system status line that

shows free memory in the system and the current time. Just to the right of that bar is a set of four mini-gadgets for the help, AmigaDOS error decoding, configuration loading, iconification, and quit functions.

hat's the quick guided tour. I'm not going to try to explain everything on the screen... much of it is self-evident. I'm just going to take a moment to point out a few things which may not be quite so obvious or things which are departures from the run-of-the-mill directory utility. One of the first things that becomes apparent when you begin to use Opus is that both mouse buttons are active. You can activate a directory window by clicking on it with either mouse button. Clicking on the list of system devices with the right button will bring up the next list (there are four lists of six buttons each). And you will also notice that many of the function buttons at the bottom of the screen actually have TWO functions one that is activated with the normal left mouse button click and another that is activated with a click of the right mouse button. For example, the "Copy" button will perform a normal copy function if activated with the left mouse button. The right mouse button will activate a "Copy As" function. In other words, before performing a copy, Opus will ask for a new file name for the copy. Clicking on the free-memory bar with the right mouse button will bring up an entirely new set of buttons. As configured from the factory, these are all blank waiting for you to fill them up.

The directory windows themselves have a few neat features. You' can scroll around in a directory using the scroll bars or by dragging the mouse in the desired direction while holding the right mouse button or by using the keyboard. The cursor keys will scroll as you would expect and a shift-cursor moves a screen at a time. The keyboard can also be used to position a directory window to a particular starting point. Just hit a letter on the keyboard and the directory will be re-positioned so that the first entry starting with that letter will be at the top of the window. Many files can be acted on by just clicking. Double-click on a picture file and the picture will be displayed. Double-click on a sound file and the sound will be played. Double-click on an archive (.LZH, ARC, or ZOO) and the contents of the archive will be displayed.

Directory Opus has also implemented a feature called "Click-M-Click". What that refers to is clicking in one window and then (within the double-click time set in Preferences) clicking in the other window. In practice you can do some nice things with this. Click on a directory in one directory window then quickly click in the other and the contents of that directory will be displayed in the second directory window. Click on an archive in one directory window and then click in the other directory window and the contents of the archive will be extracted and placed into the second directory. As a matter of fact, that's the way the Un-Arc button works as well - the contents of an archive are always placed in the destination directory. This makes unarchiving files easier thàn it's ever been before.

There are a few very nice gadget functions as well. In most directory utilities, the BYTE function simply adds up the number of bytes for the selected files. Since this number is already available at the top of the screen, Opus' BYTE function works a little differently. Select a set of

![Image](1991_11_artifacts/image_000003_c7ccd6121fe6c658a09bfaa883bdcc787265bed6c4b57eedefe03438d926939b.png)

This is the Directory Opus screen in noninterlaced mode. Notice that the number of bytes in the Libs: directory has been calculated. Also notice that the directory windows have horizontal as well as vertical scroll bars. Scrolling a window to the right will display protection bits, file date stamp information, and the file comment.

files and directories and click on the BYTE button. Opus will tell you if the selected files and directories will fit in the destination directory by placing a "Y" or "N" after the byte count on the top line of the screen. As it performs this calculation, it will calculate the total size of all the files within any selected directory and display the total on the directory line.

The DISK INFO button will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about your the drive in the active window. It will show the Device and Volume names; the total size, amount used, and amount free in bytes, blocks and Kilobytes (or Megabytes). It also shows the percent full and free, the number of bytes per block, status (Read only or Read/Write), and the date created.

The HUNT function is useful for trying to locate that file that you know is somewhere - but you just don't know where. Highlight a directory or set of directories. You will be asked for a file name (wildcards are OK). Opus will search through the directory and all subdirectories looking for files that match that pattern. When found, the directory is read and displayed with the matching files highlighted. SEARCH works in a similar fashion. Highlight a set of files and/or directories, click on SEARCH and enter your string (again, wildcards are OK). This time Opus will search through the highlighted files and directories looking for a string WITHIN the file that matches the pattern. If Opus finds the pattern, the file read function can be automatically activated and the string within the file will be displayed. Is this neat stuff or what?!

And I wauld be remiss if I didn't mention the help feature. By clicking on the HELP button (mentioned earlier) or by pressing the help key, Opus enters help mode. Click on a gadget or select a menu item and rather than activating the function, Opus will bring up a brief explanation of what the button or menu item will do. Of course, only the built-in functions are provided for, but the help file is a simple ASCII text file that can be added to if you wish to provide reminders of what your own buttons and menu items do. The HELP feature is cancelled by clicking on the HELP button or pressing the help key a second time.

said near the beginning of this article that from other directory utilities. You may notice that I have yet to even mention configurability. Truth is, even without the ability to reconfigure the program to suit your needs and desires, Opus is more powerful and easy to use right out of the box than the competition. But, nonetheless, it's now time to talk a little about the configuration. Much of it is very simple and straightforward. You get to choose whether to run it on Workbench or on a custom screen - in interlaced or noninterlaced mode. If it is on a custom screen you get to choose the depth (number of colors). You can modify the colors - and you can choose a different font. You can tell Opus how to sort the files in the directories, how the copy feature works (retain attribute bits, comment, date, etc.), whether to check before deleting files or directories, and which icons to use for the ADD ICON feature. There are many, many other things that can be modified as well... things that I'm not going to get into here for lack of space. But the real power comes in the ability to design menus and buttons - and to define new file types - to suit your needs.

The first thing to realize is which buttons and menus are configurable. Opus comes with two menus (out of five) with entries in them and with four rows of buttons (out of twelve) already configured. Guess what. YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEM ALL. That's right. If there's a

## Opus allows everything to be modified - even the preconfigured buttons and menus.

button you don't want, delete it. If there's a button you want in a different place, use the button swap feature to move it around. If there's a button that doesn't work the way you want it to work, change it. EVERYTHING is configurable.

The first things you will probably want to configure are the DRIVE buttons. These are the set of buttons on the left edge of the button bank in the lower portion of the Opus screen. There are four banks (accessed via the right mouse button) of six buttons. By default these buttons will contain the names of the first twenty-four devices in your system. These will include both physical devices and assigned devices. This may not be the devices you want listed, or you may not like the sequence, or you may want one of your devices to appear on each bank (perhaps RAM:). Do whatever you want. And they don't have to be devices either. You have two entries to make: the button name and the full path to the directory to be displayed when the button is selected. You can even choose a different color combination for the button if desired.

The procedure for configuring an action button or a menu item is the same. You supply a button name, a function to be performed when the button is selected, and make a few other choices from a provided list. The function to be performed can be an "executable" (a program), a "batch" (a script file), an ARexx program, or an internal Opus command. If, for example, you want a button to reselect all the files in the directory window that were selected for the previous operation, simply type in "Reselect" for the button name and "*reselect" for the function and you're done. The asterisk is used to designate an internal command. If you want the SHOW button to use Mostra rather than the internal show command (as I do) modify the function in the show button to read "c:M {O) e n fade 2 b fq". The {O) tells Opus to insert selected file names here. The rest of the command are the parameters that I normally pass to Mostra. Then tell Opus to do a change directory (CD) to the source directory window and not to put quotes around file names by selecting the appropriate buttons. That's it. The most powerful buttons can be designed by using the ARexx interface. Opus has a full Arexx interface. All the normal, internal Opus functions are available as well as

some designed specifically for ARexx use. Plus, of course, there is all the power inherent in ARexx itself. Naturally, this is only possible if you 1) own ARexx and 2) know how to program in it (it's similar to BASIC).

There's just one more thing to mention - defining new file types. Earlier I mentioned that a sound file could be played simply by double-clicking on the file name. That works because there are certain characteristics which identify that particular file as a sound file to Opus. In defining a file type, there are two methods which can be employed. The simplest is a suffix. You can tell Opus that when it sees a file ending in snd that that is a sound file. That's not a very reliable method. A better way is to define characteristics within the file that identify it as a specific type of file. If this method is used, Opus will interrogate the file to determine its type based on its predefined list, and then perform a predetermined action based on the type of file it finds. I just used a sound file as an example. That is not a good example because Opus already knows what picture files, sounds, tracker music files, animations, CanDo decks, and lots of other files look like. The point is, any file type can be defined to Opus along with a function to be performed when that file type is selected. (The function is defined the same as for a button or menu). I have taught Opus what a PageStream document looks like. If I double-click on a PageStream document, Opus simply brings up a requester and tells me that's what it is.

D irectory Opus is not perfect. It has a couple of bugs. These are not the guru-invoking kind - just a couple of minor problems that prove that nothing is perfect. For example, it is not possible to dragselect files if Opus is running on the Workbench screen. And there is one ARexx command that doesn't appear to work - the copywindow function.

Beyond bugs - there are several places where there is "room for improvement". There is no function to copy an existing button for the purpose of then modifying it to use it for something else. There is also no function to delete a button - the entries for button name and function must be blanked out. There is no way to directly insert a new file type into the list of file types at a specific position in the list - the new entry is always created at the bottom of the list and must then be moved to the correct position with the SWAP function. But notice something... all these areas which are in need of improvement are things that no other directory utility addresses in the first place. Directory Opus is that far ahead. And even better news... there is an upgrade already in the works that will address these shortcomings and more.

I'm not sure that Directory Opus is for everyone. The disk and memory requirements probably make it a better choice for those with hard drives and at least 1 meg of memory. But if you meet those requirements this is probably what you've been looking for. Those who have followed the PD and shareware utilities with me know that when SID came along it was such a leap ahead of the competition that all the others became instantly obsolete. SID did (and still does) things that the others haven't even thought about. Directory Opus takes an even larger step than SID did. But Directory Opus takes that giant step relative to SID - not to the competition. This is a remarkable product. My recommendation? BUY IT!

This is Directory Opus' Button Configuration screen. This shows my re-definition of the SHOW button to use MOSTRA rather than the built-in show command. Commands entered as funtions can be executable programs, AmigaDOS scripts, or ARexx programs. The button at the bottom marked 'Other func' allows access to the right mouse button function.

## Understanding Your AMIGA

Amiga memory by Harold Williams he Amiga uses Random Access Memory (RAM) to I some intomata that s being posed, the store information that is being processed. The smallest unit of memory is called a "bit" and can have a value of either 0 or 1. Data is typically represented by "bytes" which consist of eight bits each. A kilobyte is 1,024 bytes of memory and a megabyte is 1,048,576 bytes. The kilobyte and megabyte have become the standard way of measuring the available memory in computers. The Amiga 500 has 524,288 bytes of memory installed on the motherboard. This amount of memory is commonly referred to as 512K or 1/2 meg (512 kilobytes or 1/2 megabyte). Most Amiga 500 owners also have another 524,288 bytes of memory installed in the "trapdoor" expansion on the bottom of the machine bringing the total amount of memory to 1 megabyte. The original Amiga 1000 had 256K of memory but was easily expanded to 512K. The other Amiga models have 1 meg to 5 megs of memory installed. All Amigas can be expanded to 9 megs of memory and an Amiga with a 68030 processor can be expanded to even larger amounts of memory.

Memory on the Amiga is divided into three types: chip RAM, half-fast RAM and fast RAM. Chip RAM is accessible by the CPU and the custom coprocessor chips. The two varieties of fast RAM can be accessed by the CPU but not by the custom chips. Chip RAM is a little slower than fast RAM simply because it is shared by the CPU and the coprocessors. Half-fast RAM is slowed down (although not by half) because it occupies a memory location that could be chip RAM. The Amiga 500 is designed to address only 1/2 meg of chip RAM, although it has the capability of addressing 1 meg of chip RAM. When the 500 is expanded to 1 meg of memory the second 1/2 meg becomes half-fast RAM. Older Amigas were only capable of addressing 1/2 meg of chip RAM, so half-fast RAM can also be found on early 2000s. Amigas with 1 meg of chip RAM (or more) do not have half-fast RAM. Because fast RAM is a little faster than half-fast RAM, Commodore

![Image](1991_11_artifacts/image_000008_f75cb2746700a0beff924d1aaa0a3f49ebacfbfefbeaa30caf681ebc7c1c8b2f.png)

includes a utility on Workbench called FastMemFirst. Running this program will cause the Amiga to select fast RAM for use before selecting half-fast RAM. If you do not have half-fast RAM then FastMemFirst does nothing.

Adding expansion RAM to your Amiga will allow you run larger programs and handle larger quantities of data. Also, expansion RAM will increase your ability to use the multitasking nature of the Amiga. Generally, expansion RAM added to the Amiga is auto-configurable (AutoConfig). This means, the memory is automatically found by the system and does not require any special processing. If you add expansion RAM to your system using multiple expansion boards you may need to use a utility named MergeMem found in the System drawer. My system currently consists of an Amiga 2000 with the standard 1 meg of chip RAM, plus Commodore's 2 meg expansion board, and MicroBotics 8-up board with 2 meg installed. This gives me 5 megs of RAM. The 4 megs of fast RAM are automatically available to my system, but the Amiga sees it as two separate 2 meg chunks of RAM. Some programs need to be able to grab large chunks of contiguous RAM. MergeMem fools the system into seeing my fast RAM as one large chunk. The Amiga will automatically see expansion RAM as fast RAM. If you have an older Amiga 2000 and wish to boost your chip RAM to 1 meg, you will need to upgrade the Agnus coprocessor, change a jumper, and separate a trace. If any of that last sentence doesn't make sense, let your authorized Amiga dealer do the job. If you have an Amiga

500 and want to have 1 meg of chip RAM, you may not need to change the Agnus, but there is some tricky work with the motherboard. Commodore does not recommend, nor authorize the 1 meg chip conversion on the 500.

If you are considering adding expansion RAM to your Amiga, you might want to consider adding a 68030 processor with 32-bit RAM. This is a much more expensive option, but you get the added benefit of a dramatic speed increase.

## METCOM 91

## Caligari and Imagine Explored at METCOM

by Mary McWilliams Johnson

Stephen Menzies led off his presentation by showing some very impressive stills from his favorite Turbo Silver animation. Which was great, except that the announced subject was Caligari and Imagine, and the program was already off to a late start due to mechanical difficulties.

But who can blame him? If I had created that incredible art on a 1000 with 3 Megs of RAM and had managed to sell a few seconds of the animation for $1000, I'd show it off, too! After all, Menzies came all the way from Montreal to share his expertise and his effervescent excitement about two of the Amiga's hottest 3-D animation programs.

Menzies lives in a 3-D world. He teaches computer animation in the Department of Cinema, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. That department, by the way, is well supplied with Amigas - even a few Toasters. But the teaching tool he uses for the most part is Imagine. According to Menzies, this powerful (yet relatively inexpensive) program employs all the basic techniques fledgling video artists need. Mastering Imagine amply prepares them to go on to conquer expensive high-end animators on nonAmiga platforms or the more expensive Amiga products such as the Toaster's Lightwave 3D.

## Wanted: Amiga 3-D Art

By the way, Menzies encourages each of us to enter every computer animation contest we can - and he estimates that there's at least one going on at any given moment. The sale I mentioned earlier (and it's not his only one, of course) came about when a beer magnate saw his Turbo Silver anim in an exhibition and offered to buy it for "stock footage" to be used in TV commercials. Menzies claims that the world of television advertising is hungry for good animations and will gladly pay $1000 or

more for a few seconds of the stuff. Apparently there's also a market among Amiga animators for 3-D objects created in Imagine, Turbo Silver, or Lightwave. Go for it!

## Caligari Broadcast Speed Demon of the 3-D World

Caligari, as most of you know, is the speeddemon of the 3-D world, and its speed comes from its method of rendering, which is NOT ray-tracing. Speed comes also in the wonderful real time interaction you have in modeling your objects and in creating scenes. Those of you who have played with even the really cheap consumer version of Caligari know how great it is to be able to create an object and instantly render it as a solid object. Also you know that the "world" in Caligari can be tipped, rotated, shrunk or stretched instantly with your mouse. You can walk around your object or your scene and change the camera perspective smoothly and quickly. Other important features of Caligari are its high antialiasing, superior texture mapping, and environment reflection mapping. Menzies insists that Caligari beats any other 3-D renderer for speed.

I think I was most dazzled by the cutting plane feature of Caligari. Menzies showed how you can introduce a plane into an object at any point to create extra surfaces (and editable points) or use the plane to slice through an object at any angle and split it into two objects.

It's interesting to know that Caligari files can be transferred to Videoscape, Sculpt 3-D, and Lightwave. However, Impulse won't cooperate by providing the formats for Firecracker or Imagine support. But I'm sure you could save Caligari files in Lightwave format, then pop them into Art Department Professional, and save in Impulse format.

Menzies is a beta tester for Caligari Broadcast and a big fan of the famous high-end Amiga 3-D rendering and animation program from Octree Software. Menzies points out that, among other things, it is the only renderer with true metal shaders. Caligari Broadcast can also apply texture, color, and lighting attributes right down to the individual facet level. While claiming that Caligari Broadcast 2.0 is considered by many the finest 3-D renderer in the Amiga world, he readily admits that it has a few bugs in it and that its animation capabilities are somewhat limited However, the 2.1 Broadcast version he's testing promises great improvements.

One powerful feature of version 2.1 will be "envelope mapping," a technique where an "envelope" or sleeve is placed over an object (such as the arm of a robot). You then apply all sorts of movement to the envelope, which will result in a corresponding movement of the

## ON THE EDGE

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all of you who helped make the Grand Opening of The Edge Computer and Video II the tremendous success that it was. More than 1000 people visited the store on that day, of those 1000 people, 250 were non-amiga users who got their first glimpse of the greatest computer ever made.

We at The Edge Computer and Video are committed not only to servicing the existing Amiga community, but also expanding the market of Amiga users. As a user myselt, nothing has been more frustrating than Commodore's inability to market and promote what we all know to be the best personal computer available today. It is because of users like you that the Amiga has survived this long. Had it not been for our undying devotion, telling anyone and everyone that would listen what incredible things the Amiga can do, I believe we would not be where we are today.

The Edge Computer and Video is aware ot the Amiga's lack of exposure. Inis is why we have invested approximately $70,000.00 in advertising alone. Exposure of the Amiga to new people and new markets is beneficial to us all. The larger the user base, the more developers will create products tor the Amiga. Instead of 500 members in your user group, you coula nave 5,000. The list goes on and on.

As part of our "Amiga Public Awareness" campaign, we have developed a series of commercials that will begin running in November and continue through the end of this year. Over 1000 commercials will run on local networks, 3 times daily, over the next 60 days alone.

Because we feel that The Edge Computer and Video is your store, it is imperative that we hear from you. If you have questions or suggestions about the commercials, please let us know. The mission we have undertaken is of vital importance, every dollar you spend at The Edge Computer and Video is your vote for the Amiga. Our goal is to be the best, not only in price and service, but also at supporting the Amiga. In other words.....

"to boldly go where no one has gone before"!

## !! New Commodore Pricing!!

Commodore Business Machines has announced new pricing levels for several of their most popular machines. Perhaps the most exciting is the new LOW price for the Amiga 2000, which has been reduced to only $999! And for the really bargain conscious consumer, the 2000HD Professional is now only $1299! Imagine, an Amiga 2000, with a 50 Meg hard drive, and eight software titles including the Advantage spreadsheet and the powerful and popular CrossDos, for under $1300.

Continuing the trend for "More bang for the Buck", CBM has lowered the price of their entry level 3000 system as well. Just $1849, and that's not a power up price! This system includes a 16MHZ 68030, two megabytes of RAM, and a forty meg hard drive. What a great way to enter the fast lane! So come in to The Edge Computer and Video (either location) for a demonstration on any of these great deals.

## From the Director's Chair

We thought you might be interested in some details concerning the "Amiga Public Awareness" commercials we'll be running during the next two months. To our knowledge, this is the first time any third party company has run commercials that emphasized the Amiga over their store. As you may be aware, no one else has EVER advertised an Amiga Store on television here in the MetroPlex. But we at The Edge Computer and Video didn't just settle for that.

We thought, "Gee, since we're going to make some tv and radio ads anyway, wouldn't it be great to educate the general public as to what a great computer the Amiga really is?" So we bought a whole bunch of spots on Nickelodeon, CNN, USA, MTV, and the Discovery channels, and planned out a series of ads centering around

"Can the Amiga really... Do Broadcast Quality Graphics &amp; Animation Do Professional Desktop Publishing Run IBM and Macintosh Software?"

The answer to all three is, of course, a resounding YES! An interesting thing to note is that all these commercials, like our previous two for our store openings, will be done by Lone Star Picture and Sound COMPLETELY BY AMIGAS!!! Their broadcast quality studio (located adjacent to The Edge Computer and Video in Addison) contains all the tools needed to make these commercials quickly and professionally.

Shooting is already completed for the first, and post-production editing should be finished in a day or two. Look for a crowd of children examining three computers, and how they flock to the Amiga when it's turned on! Watch for them starting November 1, on the Paragon, TCI, and Storer cable networks.

## !! NEWS ALERT!! NEWS ALERT!!

Commodore Business Machines has FINALLY released Version 2.0 of the operating System for the 2000 and 500 family of computers! This extensive upgrade includes a 512K ROM, five disks, and a manual addendum documenting all the new features. Long looked for, 2.0 is the most tested Workbench update yet. It underwent literally hundreds of thousands of man-hours of beta-testing.

Contrary to popular rumor, the Enhanced Chip set is NOT necessary to run 2.0. This upgrade is available NOW at The Edge Computer and Video (both locations) for only $99.00. All Amiga So and 2x00 owners can now have the protessional look and power of Workbench 2.0.

Menzies' demonstration of Caligari Broadcast version impressed us with the power and speed of the program, but also impressed (or depressed) us with the fact that the Broadcast version costs roughly $3500, requires tons of ram to operate (at least 10-11 Megabytes), and absolutely requires an accelerator board.

## Consumer Caligari Now Features Point Editing, Animation

Those of us who now have Caligari Consumer version 1.0 have been delighted that such an inexpensive product could produce 3-D objects so quickly and easily, but we also bemoaned the fact that it does not have the point editing or animation features of the Broadcast version. And we've wished we had $3500 to buy the high-end Caligari Broadcast version.

Well, apparently we now can have the best of both worlds. The cheapie Consumer version (formerly sold for about $150) has now been replaced by Caligari Consumer 2.0. The new product, for a mere $399, "offers all the modelling and animation features of Caligari Broadcast 2:0, including single-point editing, mirroring, slicing and sweeping operator function, the ability to read Videoscape object format and interactive spline-based real-time animation features. " (A quote from Octree's advance advertisement)

Caligari Consumer version 2.0 also renders directly in HAM (4096 colors) or in full color through the use of DCTV or HAM-E.

## Imagine Makes More Than Robots

The Imagine portion of the program showed that 3-D artists can produce something besides robots and shiny spheres and cylinders. Menzies' Imagine-created scene of delicate ferns and flowers was outstanding. We oohed and ahed over the apparent difficulty of the scene. An interesting technique he let us in on was the ploy of PARTIALLY exploding a sphere to produce a lacy flower. After exploding it, he took a "snapshot" of the partially exploded sphere and saved it as an object.

Menzies is a master at getting a lot of mileage out of each object he creates, saving memory, time and effort. For instance, the ferns in the scene were composed of a few objects repeated many, many times. In another beautiful scene, he had a bed of rocks that actually was just one rock to which he had applied a rocklike texture. Then, he copied the rock over and over again, each time skewing, sizing, and warping it before placing it along with its brother rocks in an artistic creek-bed setting.

## Lightwave Makes Animation Easy

by Mary McWilliams Johnson

David Johnson of Ansoft Data Systems in Fort Worth showed off both the dynamics of the Toaster's Lightwave 3-D animator and his own superior skills in using the product.

Lightwave is fast and apparently userfriendly. Like Caligari, Lightwave derives its speed from the fact that it is not a ray-trace renderer.

In an elaborate 900-frame anim, he showed an animated bottle of eye drops working hard to get itself into its box, which was also animated. The box started out opened out flat, and folded itself up just in time for the bottle to pop itself inside.

This amazing feat involved some clever engineering in which Johnson had to "hinge" the various sides of the box appropriately so that they folded properly in sequence to produce the finished box. He also had to carefully plan the texture-mapping of the faces of the box to be sure the texture-mapping appeared on its visible surface.

Johnson finds Lightwave super-easy to use and demonstrated this by constructing an animation in which he loaded several objects of office furniture and "morphed" movements of various objects, each with its own time-line. The camera, for instance, flew around the scene in one time-line, then zoomed in on a pot plant in another time line. Meantime, the pot plant, which started out on the floor, was hopping up onto the desk, just in time for the camera to zoom in on it. He showed how each object in the scene could easily be animated across any sequence of frames independently of other objects, simply by establishing key frames for the beginning and ending points of the proposed movement.

Among other interesting features, Johnson pointed out that you can save a movement or sequence of movements you have created and apply that movement later to another object. Also, you can use the same object over and over again in the same scene - a big memory-saver.

Thank you, David, for some interesting animation tips and for a most entertaining presentation.

Public domain picks by Bill Raecke

This is for all you Imagine users out there. I recently purchased a Pixel 3D and used it convert all my old public domain objects from Sculpt-3D format to Imagine format. You'll find a wide selection of nice objects including AmiGuy (a human figure), the Starship Enterprise, a beautiful F-15 fighter, a hot-air balloon, and a VW beetle. There are 21 objects in all. I'm afraid I can't take credit for having designed any of them - and for those who know anything about my artistic ability, that's good news. You'll find them on two disks: MCCC-A\_344 and MCCC-A \_345.

## Pixel 3D Demo

Also on MCCC-A \_345, you'll find a demo version of Pixel 3D, the program that was used to convert the objects mentioned above. Pixel 3D can not only convert objects from one 3D format to another, it is also a very powerful way to change a bitmap into a 3D object. This version won't allow you to save anything, but give a look. It's a powerful product.

## Postscript Fonts

Finally - as always - there is a collection of Adobe Type 1 Postscript fonts for Pagestream users. This collection consists of 6 fonts and is well worth the trouble. Look for them on MCCC-A\_345.

## Quantum LP105S

The Quantum drive gets better by Bill Raecke recently added a second Quantum drive to my system. as a 100 meg Quantum drive. My new one is also a 100 meg Quantum drive, but this one is the new low-profile design, or LP105S. It's half the height of the old drive and therefore doesn't take up anywhere near the space when mounted on a controller card. It only overlaps one slot instead of two. The surprise was in the improved speed of the drive. It's noticeably quicker. The timings below compare the two drives. The first test is the new low-profile drive and the second is the older model. Both are tested running on the same machine (a 28mhz GVP 68030 card) with the same controller (Commodore's 2091).

Some information about the new modem by Bill Raecke

If you have a modem with v.42bis: Set BAUD rate to 9600.

Here's the tricky part for those using MNP 5 or v.42bis. You must get your terminal package to leave the computer rate at 9600 BAUD after a 2400 BAUD

s many you know by now, the MCCC BBS ha: Any be uperated a that an of me phone - lines now sports a SupraModem 2400 Plus (on the 268-4191 line). The "Plus" means that both MNP 5 and v.42bis error correction and data compression routines are supported. Regarding these changes, I need to pass along some information for those who are curious and for those who may be experiencing problems.

First - the problems. Things become a little more difficult when using one of these modems because there are now three speeds involved - not just one. With a normal 2400 BAUD modem, the BBS sends information to the modem at 2400 BAUD, the modem transmits data at 2400 BAUD, and the receiving system receives data at 2400 BAUD. (The same thing happens in reverse when transferring data to the BBS.) Everything is neat and simple. But when compression routines are employed, here's what happens. The BBS attempts to send all information to the modem at 9600 BAUD. The data is then compressed by the modem and sent over the phone line at 2400 BAUD. At the other end, your computer will receive data at a rate that will vary according to your settings and the modem you are using. The trick is to keep things in sync so that the BBS will know when to pause to prevent data from being lost. After all, if it continues to send information at 9600 BAUD and you can only receive at 2400, you won't get all the information. Text can wind up garbled and downloads will surely fail. So how do you tell the BBS to slow down? You make sure that RTS/CTS handshaking is turned on before you place your call. (This is also sometimes referred to as 7-wire handshaking.) Look for the setting in your terminal package.

No matter what your modem type, do the following: In Preferences:

Set Handshaking to none.

Set BAUD rate to 9600.

In your terminal package:

Note: if your terminal package has no such setting, you may have to set RTS/CTS in Preferences instead.

Set Handshaking to RTS/CTS (or 7-wire).

If you have a modem without error correction or compression:

Set BAUD rate to your modem's highest speed.

In your terminal package:

connection. The means to accomplish this will vary with the package you are using. Look for something relating to computer speed. I use Baud Bandit. In Baud Bandit you simply make the call at 9600 and be sure that the feature called "Auto BAUD" is OFF. "Auto BAUD" will readjust the computer rate to the connect rate and this is NOT what I want. If you can't find a way to do this, everything will work OK, but the best you will do is 2400 BAUD.

Please note that the above settings will work with both BBS phone lines and with every other BBS or service I have tried with the exception of Portal. With Portal, you can leave all the settings as indicated but you must disable MINP 5 to make a good connection. The point is, you DON'T need constantly mess with these settings.

Now, the next question. How much will all this error correction and data compression buy you? There are really two answers - one for text and one for file transfers. If you are reading messages, MNP 5 should deliver close to 4800 BAUD - v.42bis should deliver close to 9600 BAUD. If you are transferring files, the throughput will be much less. This is due to the fact that the data which is being transmitted is already compressed (usually with LHarc) and cannot be compressed much further. If you are using MNP 5 you may actually see your throughput drop to less than 2400 BAUD as the modem attempts and fails to compress the data further. For this reason, it is normally wise to disable MNP 5 data compression before placing your call if you intend to download a large amount of data. If you are using v.42bis, you will see a speedup even when downloading compressed data. I ran a few speed comparisons just to see how much things will speed up. There wasn't a great deal of variety in the results so let me just give you one example. Downloading an LZH file of 84,918 bytes took 6 minutes and 6 seconds at 2400 BAUD. Using v.42bis, that time was reduced to 5 minutes and 15 seconds. Uploads are sped up by a like amount. (While trying to get the modem and BBS set up properly, I watched a data transfer of a compressed file at close to 9600 BAUD. I sure wish I knew how that happened because I have been unable to duplicate it and everything I have read since then indicates that it is impossible.)

lucky winners were Mark Jackson and Danny Dooley.

In October, our attendance was down somewhat from last month but the quality of our programs remains high. Our ShareWare for the month is still Mostra, a graphics handling utility that can be used to view all varieties of picture file formats. It can be found on one of our Superdisk Utilities in the club library.

Don't forget our November meeting. We will be voting on Club officers and Brett Hester promises to give a great demo with Deluxe Paint IV. You are missing lots of new and exciting things if you're not attending our monthly meetings.

The program presentation for October was given by Jody Reimers. He demonstrated a package called Pixel 3D 2.0 by Axiom. This program takes 2D bitmapped objects and converts them to 3D objects. The latest version (2.0) supports more 3D formats and has a number of new features. One of these features is the ability to load it from one format, edit it, and save it to a different format. It has other abilities, such as extruding different colors to different depths to give the object a three dimensional look. This package costs about $100 and a demo disk can be found in our library. So now you can get a feel of some of its capabilities before you invest in it.

A special bonus was given to our chapter when Chris Scheers brought in his Amiga 1000 in and spent some time describing the differences between it and the Amiga's 500 &amp; 2000. He also identified some ways of upgrading the 1000 such as giving it autoboot capability without a kickstart disk by replacing the ROM chip. Another feature he demonstrated was the "AMax" cartridge which gives the Amiga the ability to emulate a MacIntosh computer. One other item of interest was the cover of the Amiga 1000. Inside the top cover are the signatures of all of the original Amiga creators. Overall, both presentations were very well done and quite interesting.

Our meeting for October was late in the month. The unusual date probably contributed to the low turnout. Those of us who were there were treated to an excellent demonstration of the greatest directory utility ever - Directory Opus. For more information on Opus read my review in this newsletter then run out and buy it. Thanks to Jim O'Flarrity of INOVAtronics for his excellent demonstration.

Be sure to be on hand in November as we elect club officers and nominate chapter officers for 1992. And, of course, join us for the usual information sharing, question &amp; answer period, etc. in addition to our featured demonstration. For November, David Johnson of Ansoft Data Systems will be on hand to give us a demonstration of some animation and video tools. David's presentations are always very interesting and very informative - so be sure to attend. In November we will revert to our normal schedule the third Thursday of the month. See you there!

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Our happy chapter was in for a real treat as I stepped up to the podium last month. You see, our President is in Europe, our V.P. was stuck at work with a Critical Program Malfunction and I, your faithful Secretary, had laryngitis. I summoned the Next In Succession from his place beside the Library Computer, and he hid under the table. So I croaked my way through my first attempt at running a meeting! Thanks, all, for being so tolerant and cooperative. As I was busy struggling to be heard, my notes are a bit skimpy, but here goes:

Our TidBytes for the month included discussion on Virtual Reality gadgets and software for the Amiga (watch for a CDTV version next year!), a preview of the festivities for the Toaster SIG meeting which was to be October 27th, and Juicy Rumors about the "floptical disk" (SCSI interface, 21 meg, $599 removable media device), the new Toaster price ($2495 Retail!), and the latest word on an official 2.0 release ("still coming...."). Also, sad news about the end of the A3000 power-up plan, but good news about Christmas specials (ask your dealer!) And a REAL tragedy: Brett Hester's Toaster literally went up in flames when a cable came loose and shorted something. (After all the times I've burned toast, this sounded sorta familiar.) We heard about the gaming contest at METCOM*91 (most folks just playing, rather than competing, but still fun; most popular were PD games!) and the "Conflicts" gaming convention where Danny Barnett got to show off the Amiga's talents (everyone seemed very impressed by Populous, and the Amiga's sound capabilities: the other systems didn't have much to "say"). Then I popped another cough drop and handed off the spotlight to our Demo.

How many of you who watched Mary McWilliams Johnson's Deluxe Paint III tutorial ran home and tried out some of her tricks? I know I did, and that was what she was trying to do: show us what WE can do without the elaborate, expensive hardware and software generally seen doing titling, animations, etc. She began

with a demo video tape showing several really flashy effects: letters dancing and zipping around, neat transitions, clever animations (I liked her "Humor in Motion"), etc. She used the presentation program TV SHOW to string all the pieces together, after queuing up some background music. Then she turned on the VCR and her A520 captured the sound and light show on tape. The A520 is a little device (ONLY $35! that lets you go Amiga-to-tape without an expensive genlock and fancy software. A few cables, an A520, and you're in the video business! (A single animation could go straight to the tape without help from TV SHOW, or AmigaVision, CanDo, or Deluxe Video III, but multiple pieces would have less polish with breaks where the tape was paused.) Think of the possibilities for demo or training films, home movies, etc., that you could produce! Even before you create your masterpiece, the setup lets you see your developing efforts as they will appear on a TV, which is NOT, Mary assures us, always how they lookon your Amiga screen. Checking your colors (especially highly saturated ones) on a real TV image may save you a lot of trouble down the road adjusting things. Anyhow, after the "show" Ms. Johnson opened the floor to "Howdja Do The One Where..." questions from the audience. She took a simple "MCCC" logo and made the letters dance until we were (ahem) C-sick. She spun them into existence and flung them through a "window" leaving an MCCC-shaped hole. She sped them up and slowed them down, and gave us enough of a "hands-on" feeling that we were able to duplicate her examples later at home. It was tremendous fun and everyone I've talked to learned a lot! A round of applause to our local writer/computer artist, for a fine and entertaining demo. (And thanks to Brett Hester, for a few extra bits and pieces of hardware, so all could see, and for helping with assembly!)

In November, we will vote on the CLUB (not chapter) officers. Nominations were announced: see elsewhere in the newsletter. Since I'm nominated as "Education Chair" I want to hear from any of you who have ideas/desires/suggestions for classes. What do you want to learn in more detail than a demo can provide? What can YOU teach those of us who don't know what you know? WHERE would you like classes (closer than Arlington?!), and when (weekends, evenings, etc.)? Bring ideas to the meeting, call, or drop me a note on the BBS. I loved Harold Williams' Workbench class at METCOM 91. Although I've been an Amiga user for years, I never got a real introduction from scratch as to how it all goes together. I want to have a lot more than an hour's explanation in the kind of patient, well-organized style Harold does so well. Who wants to join me?

Also at the November meeting, we will announce/accept nominations for our Chapter officers, to be elected in December. Call us if you wish to discuss suggestions before then. I promise next month to do a proper demo/discussion of our Shareware Spotlight, Mostra, a utility for displaying most any picture image, available in our library and used for several of our "picture disks". (That's assuming I have a voice... it's back now, but you never know!) We're hoping at our next meeting (November 20th) to see some of the

a quick update. At the August meeting John Burt and James Dunnam demonstrated speech synthesis on the C64! Joe Orr gave a disk review and showed off "Real Cool Demo" (and it was!). In September, we had a demonstration of SID stereo music for the C64, utilizing a cartridge (still available!), an amplifier, and two speakers. SID stereo downloads are readily available on Q-Link.

The members agreed that there would not be an October meeting because of METCOM. There will be a workshop held on October 9th and the regular meeting is on the 12th. METCOM was educational. The 64/128 table helped out people that had questions about their computers and softwarę.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!! In our October meeting, these nominations for officers for 1992 were made:

Due to a memory lapse and technical difficulties, I have missed reporting in the last two newsletters. For this, I humbly apologize. Here's

The October meeting brought no "tricks" but we were "treated" to a display of a Jack-0-Lantern accompanied by a flying witch and spooky music. Several disks from METCOM 91 were entered into the club library - GEOS utilities, SCUD Buster and other enjoyable games were just a few of these additions.

We appreciate their willingness to serve as officers and their efforts to keep our chapter functioning as a vital part of the MCCC.

To show your continued support for our chapter, please attend the November meeting, when we will vote for officers for 1992. Remember, your vote counts!

We will be meeting on November 9, 1:30 pm at West Berry Church of Christ, 2701 West Berry. Mark your calendars and make plans to be there!

## H.E.B. Robyn Wilson

METCOM was the highlight for last month. There was a good turnout. We had our help desk, which Glen Herring and I officiated. There was also a table for 64/128 products for sale at the flea market.

At the meeting on November 2nd, officers will be decided upon for 1992. We need to be brave and take on some challenges in order to make our chapter a success for the next year.
