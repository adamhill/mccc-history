## TurboText

## A new text editing powerhouse from Oxxi by Bill Raecke

f you do any editing of text files on your system, you are supplied with your system. Most of you probably already have. ED is the simpler of the two text editors supplied, but it suffers from having a totally Intuition-free interface. What happened to the pull-down menus, the gadgets, all the stuff that makes an Amiga an Amiga? MEmacs is a more powerful editor - and it adds menus and some of the standard Amiga features. But it too has some major shortcomings. Even something as simple and basic as a file requester has been omitted.

So, if you don't get a good editor with the system, where do you go? There is always the MCCC library and bulletin board. There are many nice text editors available there. But for the top of the line, you need to go to the commercial products. Until now, there have been just two available (that I am aware of). IxEd is the veteran. It is the editor I have been using in my system for years now. But IxEd is no longer being marketed and it is in need of some additional features. That leaves Cygnus Ed. Cygnus Ed offers some terrific features and has undoubtedly been the editor of choice in recent years. Its only real drawback is that it didn't offer ENOUGH new features to make it worth the rather hefty price to someone like me who already had an adequate, if limited, editor in IxEd.

Then along came TurboText. I heard about TurboText for the first time though a mailing which was sent out to all registered owners of IxEd. In the mailing was a flyer for the new product and a letter from the author of TxEd stating that he would no longer be marketing his product and that he thought that TurboText would be a terrific upgrade. To make the deal sweeter, Oxxi offered an upgrade from IxEd to TurboText for just $54.95 (including shipping) if you purchased it prior to release. Since I was becoming more and more dissatisfied with the things I was unable to do in IxEd and since the price was a better deal than I was likely to come across elsewhere, I decided to take a chance on an unseen product and spring for it. Everyone needs to live dangerously once in a while. To make a long story short, the investment was well worth it.

## What You Get

TurboText comes on a single, unprotected disk. On the disk are the program and a lot of support files. More on those later. Along with the disk is a nice, spiral-ring manual about 3/4 of an inch thick. The first page of the manual is a tear-out, quick-reference card containing all the standard keyboard commands. The second page is the registration card. The rest of the manual is divided into twelve chapters, five appendices, a glossary, and an index. The manual is well laid out. There is no tutorial as such, but if you follow the manual through it leads you quickly through all the features in a logical fashion. And the arrangement of the material is such that the manual also serves as an excellent reference guide.

Installing the program is no problem. If you have a floppy-based system, the program will run just fine from a copy of the TurboText program disk. The only installation required in that case are the supplied ARexx programs which should be installed in the system ARexx: drawer. ARexx is NOT a requirement for TurboText but TurboText has a very powerful ARexx interface which makes it an even more flexible tool. Installation on a hard drive is painless. Complete instructions are provided on how to proceed under either AmigaDOS 1.3 or 2.0. The only complication is that TurboText needs an "assign" in order to find its support files. Under AmigaDOS 2.0 this "assign" is performed automatically. For those using AmigaDOS 1.3 the "assign" should be added to the startup-sequence. For the uninitiated, complete instructions are provided on adding the "assign" command to your startup-sequence.

Now - how to tell you about TurboText. This is somewhat of a dilemma. If I try to cover all the features of this editor, we will soon run out of space in the

newsletter. What I'm going to have to do is to cover the points that most impressed me about the program. These may not be the same points that would impress others and it will by no means be a comprehensive list - but since I'm writing the article I get to pick what I write about.

## The Basics

Any number of documents can be opened at the same time. Documents can be any size. Each document resides in its own window. Cutting and pasting between documents is fully supported. The program will only run once. Even if you forget and execute it a second time, it will detect that it is already running and will simply pop the original copy to the front (with the new document opened in a new window if a new document was specified when it was run) thus saving memory. TurboText can run in a hidden mode waiting to be activated via hot-key for instant access if desired.

## Document Handling

TurboText maintains two positions in every document. By pressing the Right\_ Amiga-T combination (by default) you can swap between those two positions. This is invaluable when programming when you want to be sure that the variable names you are using are the correct ones. As an option, you can split the view and see both positions simultaneously. When you do this, a narrow horizontal bar appears in the middle of the window. The bar can be pulled up or down with the mouse (or a keyboard equivalent) to enlarge one view while shrinking the other. Either view may be modified.

This is the TurboText document window. It is running on a custom, four-color, interlace screen with an 11-point font.

Across the center of the window is a bar separating the two views of this document.

The document being displayed is the standard TurboText definition file. This definition is not required to run TurboText because these definitions are built in, but the file serves as a guide to the standard settings and is a great platform from which to make your own custom modifications.

Of course the normal cut/paste operations are supported - and even cutting/pasting a vertical column is allowed. But there are a couple of other neat editing features as well. Did you ever have a block of text that needed to be moved to the left or right? In TurboText, simply highlight the block and use the CTRL-cursor key combination to move the entire block in either direction. And even more powerful still is the "Folds" function. "Folding text" refers to the process of not displaying portions of the text to make working with the document easier. For instance, if you are working on a program and you know that your subroutines are working properly, you might want to "fold" them so that only the names of the subroutines were visible. That way there is not as much to clutter up the screen. Folds can be unfolded at any time (they affect the display, not the document itself). Nested folds are allowed. And if you have TurboText set up so that icons are saved along with files, the fold information is saved in the icon and automatically activated the next time you call up that document so that it looks just as it did the last time. Pretty powerful and useful stuff.

TurboText supports macros as well. You can load a previously saved macro, of course (macros are all individual files), but the most powerful way to use them is to create them on the fly. Turn on "Record Macro" and do whatever it is you need to do. Then "Stop Recording" and "Play Macro" as many times as you need to. There is even a "Play Many" function where you specify how many times to play the macro (a value of 0 indicates to do it until an error occurs i.e. the end of the file). Then, if you think you

![Image](1991_06_artifacts/image_000001_a449eeed6376c57394bc2a29da558b1823bbe1bc5f266d807ff6d38f773e81e9.png)

might need that macro again, save it to disk. It is saved as an ASCII file, ready to be turned into an ARexx program if desired.

## System Preferences

There are three sets of system preferences that can be set and saved to disk. All are saved as a single file. The first is the "Display Prefs". Here you get to choose what screen to use (Workbench, 2 color, 4 color, 2 color hi-res, or 4-color hi-res), the size of the screen, the font to use, and the colors of the screen. Under "Edit Prefs" there are even more options. Do you want a new line to have the same indentation as the previous line? Should the default be overstrike or insert? Do you want to see tab characters? spaces? end of lines? How many spaces is a tab? There are lots more. And under "File Prefs" you choose whether to save project icons, whether to perform "auto-saves", and whether to maintain backups. Let me say just a little more about those last two options. If you select "autosave" (as I do), you also specify a delay amount. If you specify 15 minutes, for example, an internal clock will begin ticking the second you make a change to the document. After the 15 minutes have elapsed TurboText will either automatically save the file or will ask if it should (depending, again, on how you specify the option in the "File Prefs"). This could save a lot of work when time gets away from you and you experience that power failure. The "backup" option deals with whether a copy of the previous version(s) of the document are maintained when it is saved. You tell TurboText where to put the backups, what to name them, and (if numbered) how many backup versions to maintain. Once all your preferences are set, you can save them to disk under the filename of your choice (to be loaded back in when you need them) or you can save them as the defaults to be used every time TurboText is run. What this means is that you can have multiple sets of preferences which can be invoked for different purposes.

## Program Configuration

While we're on the subject of preferences, I need to talk about other configurable items. Namely the menu structure and keyboard. Everything is totally configurable. TurboText comes with a set of defaults built in, but if you want to change any of those defaults you

But I need to slow down a bit here and go into the configuration files in more detail. There are actually a number of different sections in a configuration file - and any given configuration file can consist of just one or as many as you like of these sections. Each section included in a configuration file can be set up to replace previous definitions for the section or add to existing definitions. The first section, as mentioned above, is the "menu" section. You may have any number of menus, any number of items (limited by screen size), and even sub-items. And in the menu definition you can also define a keyboard equivalent if desired. These will always be combinations of the Right Amiga key and some other character. Oxxi has also allowed for the addition of a "bar" in a menu. This is just a simple separator - but it can sure aid in legibility when used to divide a menu into sections. The next section is the "keyboard" section. Here you can specify a set of keys which will cause a specific action. Modifiers include the SHIFT, ALT, CTRL, NUM PAD, LEFT\_AMIGA and others. The next section is the "hotkey" section. These are typically combinations of three characters (i.e. CTRL-ALT-W) which will be acted on by TurboText regardless of what application is active at the time. In other words, you could be in the CLI, hit the correct combination, and have TurboText pop to the front. The next section is the "mouse" definition. That's right you can even program your mouse. Of course the right mouse button and the left mouse button already have system definitions that cannot be overridden. But it is possible to assign a special purpose to holding down the left button and clicking the right button, for example. For

![Image](1991_06_artifacts/image_000002_d545e0a41e80b238144799ec57ab17fd75e71ee92c9d529f827fffba30b5603f.png)

This is the TurboText File Prefs Requester. Note the settings for the Auto-Save functions in the lower left. In the upper right are the backup options. It is currently set so that backups are stored in the t: device, with the same name as the original file, but with a "number" extension. There will be a maximum of 3 backups maintained.

have total control. This can be done a couple of different ways. Either you can replace the entire existing configuration or you can add to it. And just as you can do with the other system preferences, you can load a particular configuration when needed from a named file on a disk, or you can specify a default configuration to be used each time the program is run. Remember earlier when I made mention of the support files supplied on the disk? Most of them are configuration files set up so that you can emulate other text editors or word processors. If you want it to look and act like IxEd, it's easy. Likewise Cygnus Ed. Or Wordstar. The configuration files are simply ASCII text files that can be edited right in TurboText.

users of AmigaDOS 2.0, you can even program special uses for the middle mouse button, either singly or in combination with another button.

Now we come to some even more powerful sections. There is a "dictionary" section. This can come in handy for programming. If you typically program in C, for instance, you can define all the standard functions in the "dictionary". TurboText can then correct the case automatically as you enter your program and can even help you correct your mis-spelled commands. The next section is a "template" section. TurboText can put a template into your document just based on a single word. Type the word, press the template key (F2 by default) and a template will be entered into the document ready to be filled in. Another nice feature for programmers. To make things easier, configuration files containing "definition" and "template" sections are included for all the major programming languages including C, ADA, Assembler, COBOL and Modula 2. Next is the "text strings" section. This is where all the text strings used by TurboText in requesters and in error messages can be defined. This section can be used to convert TurboText to another language or simply to change something so it makes more sense to you. Finally, there is the "links" section. This is where you can specify other configuration files to be used in addition to the current one.

## The Possibilities

Well, we've talked about defining the menus, keyboards and the like. What can you define it to do? There are over 140 built in functions that can be executed via menu or keyboard. And to make things even more powerful, any menu item or keyboard combination can be used to launch an ARexx script. That script can then perform any series of commands, and, as with any ARexx script, that command can be an command internal to the initiating program, an ARex* command, a system command, or a command understood by any other program in your system. The possibilities are unlimited. As an example, the accompanying box shows a small ARexx script I wrote to perform a function not included in TurboText. I find it handy be able to repeat a given line and then change it. And I like to be able to do that in one operation rather than by using the copy and then the paste function. The function shown will repeat a block or text I mark or it will repeat any single line that the cursor is on - and it will repeat either the block or the single line any number of times. Take a look at it.

Simple, right? Simple, yet very powerful.

## The Verdict

I'm impressed. And I haven't even mentioned some of the things that impress me. Like the HEX Editor. Or the Bookmark feature. Or the ability to execute an ARexx program even if it's not tied to a menu or the keyboard. Or the case conversion. Or... I said I had to stop before I filled up the newsletter. Now's the time. So far, I've only found one thing that was left out - the ability to Search/Replace HEX strings or characters. Of course that's something that can be added via ARexx, but I think that's a basic enough need that it should have been included. Maybe it's there and I haven't figured out how to use it. Anyway, one complaint on a brand new, powerful program like this is pretty good. It's been performing flawlessly. I can't recommend this one highly enough. On a scale of one to ten - it's a ten. If you're in the market for a top-notch text editor, look no further than TurboText.

## Understanding Your AMIGA

Installing a custom icon for the RAM disk device by Harold Williams he Amiga WorkBench supplies a default disk icon default icon is a simple square with one corner cut off. The standard Amiga boot procedure creates a RAM disk device but does not create a custom icon. Replacing the resulting default icon with a more elegant picture will enhance the appearance of your WorkBench. It is a simple procedure to provide a custom icon for floppy disks and hard disks. The RAM disk is a problem because it does not exist except while the Amiga is running. Learning to modify the RAM disk icon is a useful project. Your WorkBench will look better and you will develop a better understanding of how the Amiga operates.

## The Background

The Amiga checks each available disk for a file named "Disk.info" in the disk's root directory. If such a file exists and is a valid disk icon file, then the Amiga WorkBench will display the icon image stored in the file and associate it with the disk. Note that the naming convention for disk icon files is different from the naming convention for other Amiga icons. Tool, Project, Drawer, and Garbage icon files have names that match the associated object name with the suffix " info" added. The disk icon is always named "Disk.info" regardless of the name of the disk. If you have a disk with a custom icon that you would like to use with another disk, transferring the icon image is as simple as copying the "Disk.info" file from one disk to another. The file copy can be done with the Amiga Shell using the AmigaDOS "copy" command or can be done with a file utility program. After the file copy has been completed the new disk image will not appear. on WorkBench until the Amiga operating system notices the change. To make this happen with a floppy disk remove the disk from the drive and then re-insert it. A disk icon on a hard drive will require a re-boot to make it appear on WorkBench. During the boot procedure the Amiga looks for a file named Startup-Sequence in the S: device. The default Startup-Sequence includes the command "LoadWB delay". This command activates the Amiga WorkBench. When WorkBench is activated it looks for the "Disk.info" file on each available disk device. If the disk icon file is found, then the custom icon image is displayed on WorkBench. This procedure will not work with the RAM disk because there is no physical disk to remove and then re-insert, and a re-boot will clear all files stored in the RAM disk including the "Disk.info" file.

Understanding the above procedure is the key to

![Image](1991_06_artifacts/image_000003_328682363c03d1fe9f0844cb7a7a95070c2214fa3f10c206c956b427467ba7b6.png)

installing a custom icon for the RAM device. A "Disk.info" file must be placed in the RAM disk before the command "LoadWB" occurs during the boot procedure. This can only be done by modifying the Startup-Sequence file. If you are not accustomed to changing your StartupSequence be aware that this is the heart of the Amiga's boot procedure. If you break the Startup-Sequence, the Amiga will not complete the boot procedure and you may find yourself in desperate need of a friend who is familiar with Startup-Sequence modification. If you boot from a floppy, then this modification is not so dangerous. Make a copy of your boot disk and modify the copy. If you boot from a hard drive, you should make a copy of your Startup-Sequence. You will have to modify the file named "Startup-Sequence", but the copy can be used to recover the original file if your modifications are faulty.

## Getting It Done

Here is the procedure for creating a custom RAM disk icon. 1) Create or obtain an appropriate "Disk.info" file. You can create a disk icon using IconEd found in the Tools drawer on your Extras disk or WorkBench disk. IconMaster by John Scheib is a much better icon editor and is available from the MCCC library and the MCCC BBS. But you do not have to create your own icon! You will find a huge number of icon images in the MCCC library and on the MCCC BBS. 2) Copy the "Disk.info" file to your system disk. If you copy it to the root directory of your system disk it will become the icon image for your system disk. This is probably not desirable. There are two solutions. First, do not name it "Disk.info". Name it something like "RAMDisk.info". This will keep the Amiga operating system from seeing it as a disk icon file. Secondly, you could copy the file to a place other than the root directory of your system disk. A good place would be S:. 3) Modify your Startup-Sequence to copy the icon file to RAM:. Modifying your Startup-Sequence requires the use of a text editor. MEmacs can be found in the Tools drawer. Textra by Mike Haas is a little easier to use and is available from the library or the BBS. You must add the copy command ahead of the line that reads "LoadWB delay". The safest place is the line directly above the "LoadWB" command. If your copy command fails you can execute the "LoadWB" and "EndCLI" commands directly on the CLI and you will find your Amiga ready to work as usual. If you placed the disk icon on your system disk and named it "RAMDisk.info", the copy command you should place in your Startup-Sequence is "Copy

The latest developments from Foster McCowan

Commodore recently launched its "Amiga Power Up Program". This Amiga customer recruitment program unabashedly zeroes in on the machines most eligible prospective consumer, the current owners of other Commodore CPU's. This unique trade-up program does not require customers to give up their current Commodore CPU's. Existing system ownership qualifies customers to purchase the company's most powerful CPU, the Amiga 3000, at savings up to $1500 from the manufacturer's suggested retail price. The Commodore products that are eligible to be used in the Power Up Program are: Vic-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, Amiga 500, 1000, or 2000 series computers. To prove ownership of a Commodore CPU, owners are required to write the serial number of their CPU on the cover of the original owner's manual. The cover should then be submitted with your order for an A3000 to your participating authorized Commodore dealer. The following savings can be obtained toward the purchase of an A3000.

| Computer                     | MSRP   | Savings   |

The program is both a reward and an incentive. It rewards our user base with the option for saving money and encourages ownership of the versatility provided by the most advanced technology Commodore offers." This offer is available until June 30, 1991 at participating Commodore dealers.

## News Flash

In April of this year, Commodore has made a much needed change in their marketing efforts. They have transferred their advertising and public relations contract to Ketchum Communications and Ketchum Public Relations respectively. Ketchum, with principal offices in Philadelphia, replaces Fleishman-Hillard Inc. This change was seen as positive response from critics who felt and let it be known that Commodore did not know how to market its products in the U.S. market. Ketchum is thought to be the choice of David Archambault who directs the marketing efforts of Commodore's U.S. unit. Watch for an aggressive ad campaign this fall.

## Mo' Better Memory

Expanding the possibilities - Part 2 C64/128 information from Foster McCowan uick Brown Boxes Quick Brown Boxes (QBB) by Brown Boxes, Inc. are user-programmable, battery backed, auto-start cartridges, packaged with utilities that will also allow you to use them as RAM disks (remember that term?). QBB's interface to the Commodore computer by way of the expansion/cartridge port. They are standard size cartridges with a sliding C64-128 mode switch, a push button reset switch and they are available in the following capacities: 256K, 128K, 64K and 32K. The reset switch restarts the computer and leaves RAM intact (you won't lose any data) on a C64; on a C128, it performs a standard reset. The cartridge, although it uses the expansion port, is theoretically compatible with an REU because it doesn't utilize the same memory addresses as the expansion unit. However you'll need an expansion board to plug both cartridges in at the same time.

One of utilities that come with QBB, the Manager, allows you to do different things. The manager controls initialization, loading and deleting programs, and saving the entire contents to disk. If you want to load programs from computer memory into the box without the manager you can initialize the box to act as RAM disk. Set up this way, the cartridge supplies a wedge for loading, saving, and deleting programs from the cartridge. On 32K and 64K boxes, 16K can be set aside as unnamed program storage where single keystrokes can save and load a program. Any single program can also be assigned to autostart each time the computer is turned on, and programs can be linked. A very big added feature of QBB is the potential for custom applications. Think of it as a programmable cartridge. Every time the computer is turned on, the program runs automatically, and data can be saved to the cartridge as well. A couple of pokes is all it takes to control the cartridge's memory banks, and once mapped into the computer's address space, you can treat the boxes as normal RAM. For those computerists that have already purchased a 64K QBB, you can now add the new QBB-B+ Extender Card to store 182K of C64 or 128 programs.

## RAMDRIVE

RAMDRIVE from Creative Micro Designs (CMD) is a self contained battery-backed cartridge of 512K, 1mb and 2mb capacities. RAMDRIVE utilizes RL DOS, an ultra fast, easy to use operating system similar to that of CMD's HD series hard drives. RAMDRIVE's area of exclusivity is that it allows for the compatibility of vast amounts of commercial software, unlike the aforementioned units. Its speed is heavyweight as well, purported to operate up to 20 times faster than Commodore RAMDOS. Its power backup, reset switch, disable switch, and its ability to be expanded to 2 megs makes this product a formidable entry into the RAM expansion race. It includes software for copying and GEOS compatibility.

## RAMLINK

RAMLINK, a new product from Creative Micro Designs (CMD), is a multi-purpose hardware interface designed to overcome the limitations of existing RAM expansion units. RAMLINK incorporates CMD's proprietary RL-DOS to allow most software to utilize the

These versatile products and services provide for capabilities not thought of when we first purchased our computers.

1700 series REU's, GeoRAM and CMD's RAMDRIVE as if they were disk drives. This virtually makes all 8-bit software compatible with RAM expansion units. For those who have not yet invested in REU, there is an optional RAM CARD which installs internally onto RAMLINK's board and allows for RAMLINK to be utilized as a disk drive. This is probably the most spectacular advancement in the history of 8-bit Commodore expansion because this allows for a maximum capacity (if you can afford it) of up to 16 megabytes of user expandable memory using standard SIMM chips! In case you already have an REU the unit has a pass-thru connector design with reset, and an optional battery back up unit to protect against power outages.

## OTHER

The ever-expanding world of expandability has not been totally the domain of new products. Melvin Montgomery of Montgomery Computer Service (MCS) of Plano, Texas has a service that expands a standard REUs · (including GeoRAM) memory to 1 or 2 megs. This allows for the use of an expander to emulate a 1581 drive (800K) or even two 1581 RAM Disks. As more programs, such as Geo Wizard from Comm-Plex Software or the GATEWAY from CMD (which use huge amounts of RAM for their performance) become available this added feature will prove to be a "must have". A heavy-duty power supply is recommended for the C64 on a 2-meg expansion.

## CONCLUSION

## Dealers

What good are local dealers? by Ed Jackson n response to Mr. Jackson's article regarding the purchasing, I should like to say that Amiga dealers, like Amiga USERS are not like dealers and users of other brands. As purchasers of well over eight thousand dollars worth of Amiga hardware and software, my wife and I have found in-store dealers to be of little value, although up to NOW we have not dealt with mail order houses.

Amiga dealers, like most Amiga users are hard core computer buffs. They delight in the complications of highly esoteric graphic and sound uses of the computer. Try to buy ANYTHING, hardware OR software, in an Amiga store, and you'd better be one of the "insiders" or have the patience of Job. The personnel are in DEEP discussions of new techniques and procedures with one of the "insiders" , and don't even know you are THERE.

Amazing had a WALL full of games. The shelf for data base, word processing, and other productivity programs stretched from he to re. Sound and graphics programs had more space. RARELY did we find more than one sales person at a time in the store. We wondered how long they could stay in business with those sort of business practices, and were not surprised to find an empty building the last time we drove out there.

We are as sorry as anyone else for the demise of Amazing Computers since it was the only game in town, but as many times as we went INTO the store, more times than not we went out empty handed simply because we did not have the TIME to wait for some in depth discussion to come to an end. When I purchased my 500, for instance, we asked for a demonstration, and after only a few moments, the sales person excused himself and proceeded to retire to the parking lot to talk to one of the "insiders" until we simply gave up and LEFT. We wound up driving to somewhere in Dallas to buy our machine.

In-store sales people seem to fall into two categories. Those for MOST machines, who don't CARE, and those for Amigas who don't care about YOU. They apparently care very PASSIONATELY about computers in general, and Amigas in particular. With others of "their kind," i.e. high-tech buffs, they are well informed and helpful. The "outsider" has no chance.

Babbages has waffled between NO Amiga software, and VERY LITTLE Amiga software, with GAMES comprising ninety-nine and forty four one hundredths percent of their limited stock. We had probably one of the first Amiga 1000's in town. We were on the waiting list before shipments really started. We STILL think they are FANTASTIC machines, but wonder why we ever bought a machine that one has to join a user support group to operate successfully.

As for DEALERS... who NEEDS them?

## Using PageStream

The Basics of Font Usage - Part 3 by Bill Raecke ast month I promised to wrap up our discussion of . handling text in PageStream with this article. Let's see if I can keep my promise. Actually, there is still quite a bit to cover so let's just get right to it.

The first thing I want to cover is text formatting. First, the basics. Pagestream allows you to format text using "block left" or "block right" options. By using one of these format options, the text will be lined up on the specified side - the other side of the text will be left ragged. There is also a "center" option which is just what it says it is... the text will be centered between the left and right margin. But what if you want the text to extend to both the left and right margins as in this newsletter? That is known as "justification" — and PageStream allows you to use any one of three justification methods. The first is "character justification". By using "character justification" you are telling PageStream that you want to calculate the extra space available to that line and divide that extra space evenly so that an equal amount of extra space appears between each character. This method looks good for most purposes, but for short lines with only a couple of words sometimes the characters in a word will seem too spread out. The second method is "word justification". This method will cause PageStream to take that extra space available on the line and divide it up so that WORDS receive an equal amount of the extra space between them. The characters that make up a word are not spaced any further apart in this instance. The disadvantage here is that if the column width is too narrow the space between the words can take on the appearance of a winding road that travels generally vertically down the column. The third method is a compromise between the other two methods. When "auto justification" is chosen PageStream will place the extra space on a line between the characters in a word and between the words - but there is more space placed between the words. This is the justification used in most of the text in this newsletter. I find that it gives the most pleasing results in most instances. But just remember - if it was always the best way, the other methods wouldn't be there. The results will vary depending on the column width, the typeface and size chosen, and even the column height. The best thing to do is watch for some of the unpleasant side effects of any of the methods and use the method that is best suited for the task at hand.

You can decrease the size of the font, decrease the WIDTH of a font, choose a different, narrower font, or increase the width of the column. But sometimes none of these remedies is appropriate. Sometimes the problem occurs on just one or two lines of text. You'll generally find that if this happens it is because of an unusually long word on the following line. The best way to remedy this situation is to hyphenate the long word so that part of it can flow back up to the line that has so little on it. There are a couple of ways to hyphenate a word. If there really is a problem on just one line, the easiest way is to go into "Text" mode by selecting the letter "A" from the toolbox, place your cursor where you want the hyphen to appear and then choose "Manual Hyphenate" from the "Text" menu. This will place a "soft hyphen" in the word where the cursor was and should cause the front portion of the word to move up to the previous line. If it does not, that means that there was insufficient room on the line to hold that portion of the word. Try placing the hyphen elsewhere. Some of you are probably wondering what a "soft hyphen" is. What the term refers to is a hyphen that will only appear at the end of a line. In other words, if you re-format the text later so that it is NOT necessary for PageStream to hyphenate the word, the hyphen will not appear. PageStream will break a word at a "hard hyphen" too, but if you use a regular hard hyphen (a dash), the hyphen will appear even if it is not at the end of a line.

You will notice that many of the unpleasant sideeffects of any of the justification methods occur when there are too few words in a line of text. Of course there are many ways to increase the number of words on a line.

OK. So that's great if what you have is a single instance of a line that has too little on it. What if I have a need for an especially narrow column and I need lots of hyphenation? This is something I run into when I put a picture down on a page and the portion of the text column remaining outside the picture becomes very narrow. PageStream can handle that using the "Batch Hyphenate" function from the "Text" menu. You can "batch hyphenate" a block of text by either highlighting the section of text to be hyphenated with the text tool, or you can select an entire block of text to be hyphenated with the object tool. Once the text has been selected by either means, simply select the "Batch Hyphenate" function and your text will be reformatted. The hyphenation is done based on some general rules established in the "Global" menu under the item "Set Hyphenation Rules". There are defaults already established for you. Things like the "minimum word length to hyphenate" and the "minimum number of characters before/after hyphen" already have values established but can be reconfigured to suit your tastes. If you save these settings as "Default" they will be used each time you fire up PageStream. To make this

feature even more powerful, it is possible to edit the hyphenation dictionary directly. This can be used to specify to PageStream how you want a specific word to be handled. To do this, choose the "Edit Hyphen Exceptions" item from the "Global" menu. You will be presented with a requester. Type in the word you are interested in and press the "Hyphenate" gadget. PageStream will show you (with slashes) where it would consider hyphenating the word based on the current hyphenation rules. If this is not the way you want the word hyphenated, indicate the correct placement of hyphens (with slashes) and press the "Add" gadget. This will update the hyphenation dictionary.

Time now for a couple of hints to make your text look better and more professional. First hint: There are two basic ways to format text. You can either use indented paragraphs (where the indent of the first line of a paragraph indicates the beginning) or you can use blocked paragraphs. In blocked paragraphs there is no indent used. The paragraphs are defined instead by the presence of a blank line between them. NEVER use both indents AND a blank line between paragraphs. This has nothing to do with PageStream but it is a rule that I see broken in so many other newsletters I have to mention it. Using both methods together is redundant and it looks bad. You won't see it in professional publications. Second hint: If you are using indented paragraphs, never do your indenting with spaces. If you are using one of the justification methods discussed above the width of a space can vary as PageStream finds a place to put that extra space on the line. If you use spaces you will find that the indent from paragraph to paragraph will vary. The result is sloppylooking. To avoid the problem and to ensure that every indent is the same size use either the Tab or the "Indented Paragraph" function.

chisel and marking on a stone tablet. It ain't good enough. Anyway, the default first tab position (24 points) is a good spot for a paragraph indent. Using the tab key to indent the paragraph will ensure that each paragraph is indented by precisely the same amount - 24 points.

But I don't recommend that you use tab positions to indent the beginnings of paragraphs (although tabs can be used quite effectively for other purposes). A better way to indent the beginning of paragraphs is to use the "Indented Paragraph" function. Why is it better? Well, let's assume that you are going to flow your text around an object. I know that we haven't talked about that subject yet, but let's jump ahead a little and assume that we have. For example, if we put a picture on the page and tell stead at to es de a diam ast. assume further that the portion of text that we extend into contains the beginning of a new paragraph. If we are using tabs to mark the beginning of paragraphs, what happens? That tab position is locked into a specific horizontal location in the text column. The beginning of the paragraph will no longer be indented by the same amount as the other paragraphs - and if the picture extends into the column by a great enough amount, it may not be indented at all. The "Indented Paragraph" function gets around that problem. It ensures that the beginning of each paragraph is indented by a specific amount as measured from the left edge of the AVAILABLE TEXT AREA. So if you have your paragraph indent set to .25 inches, each paragraph will be indented by exactly 25 inches. How do you use it? It can be applied to an entire block of text with the object tool or to a specific portion of

First let's talk about tabs. You will find that by default, PageStream will set up any text block with four tabs positioned at 24, 48, 72 and 96 points. To see them, select the "Show Tabs" item from the "View" menu. At the top of your block of text are a series of four dots in a narrow horizontal bar. These are the tab positions. To add a tab position, select the text tool and click in the bar where you want the new tab position to be. To remove one, click on it and it will go away. One of my pet peeves with PageStream (bet you didn't think I had one) is the inability to adjust tab positions accurately. In a program where most things can be controlled to within thousandths of an inch, clicking on a spot is like dragging out the old hammer and

![Image](1991_06_artifacts/image_000006_df3cdbc2adb92bdcdb711040fc4e583145246ff8dca6759fa8b66fce7cc48131.png)

the text by highlighting the correct portion with the text tool. The first time you use this function you will probably need to set the amount of paragraph indent - "Set Indent/Outdent" item from the "Text" menu. Once set, this should probably be saved as a default setting (select "Save Doc Defaults" from the "File" menu). Once the amount of indent has been set, simply select "Indented Paragraph" from the "Text" menu. That's it!

Third hint: PageStream makes available many special characters that are unavailable from the keyboard. There can be up to 252 characters available in any particular typeface. When you get beyond the normal character set consisting of the alphabet and numbers and a few special characters available from the standard keyboard, you need to use one of two methods to access these special characters. By using the CTRL-C combination and then a Mnemonic character set, you can call up the special character more-or-less by name. By using the CTRL-D combination and then a three-digit number you can call up the special character by its ASCII value. The trick is, you need to know what characters are available. In the back of the PageStream manual (Appendix C), it lists the standard character set, the associated ASCII value, and the associated mnemonic. The problem is, many of the fonts you will be using do not have the full complement of special characters - and some may have some of the characters defined to non-standard ASCII values. Where that leaves you is that in order to use any special characters you need to print out a sample sheet of all the characters in a typeface along with their associated ASCII values so you can see what you have to work with. Just a little job to while away those empty hours.

But you may be wondering why you should care. Well, the sub-topic of this section is "Some Hints for Better-looking Text". Using some of these special characters can give your documents that professional look. An example? When I write, you may have noticed that I am prone to the use of dashes in my text. In standard typewritten text, this kind of dash is normally displayed as a double dash. When writing my articles in Word Perfect I use the double dash format. But in typesetting, this is not considered correct. What you need is what is known as an "em dash". An em dash is just a single dash character, but it is twice as long as the standard hyphen. I can access it by using the "CTRL-C m." combination or the "CTRL-D 174" combination. What I do is import a document into PageStream and then use the "Replace Text" feature (found in the "Edit" menu) to change the double-dash to the em dash everywhere it occurs in the document. Another common example is the " character. When writing in Word Perfect, three periods are used to indicate the completion of a thought. In typesetting, three periods are not considered correct because of the effects that justification can have on spacing. Rather than use three periods, use what is known as an "ellipsis" which is accessible by the "CTRL-C .."combination or the "CTRL-D 175" combination. These too can be changed via the "Replace Text" function which makes it rather painless. Just remember that the actual values used may vary depending on the particular font you are using.

M aking Text Look Different Nope - you're not just limited to straight text, your text can be one of, or a combination of, the twelve different styles on the "Style" menu. There is italic, bold, backslant, mirror, underline, double-underline and a whole lot more. In addition, you can modify the look of the text by choosing a special fill-pattern or color or grey-scale from the "Fill Style" item of the "Object" menu. Most of this is pretty self-evident if you've used the program. The reason I bring it up is to point out a couple of things that may NOT be self evident. First: When assigning a fill-pattern, color, or grey-scale to text, you MUST use the text tool and highlight the portion of text to be modified. (This is not true with any of the styles available from the "Style" menu.) Second: A grey-scale can be selected by typing the value of the desired greyscale into the "Style" at the top of the "Fill Style" requester followed by a percent sign. Third: You will want to create a sample sheet or two by printing samples of each of the fill patterns and grey-scales to see how they look on your printer because the results will vary. For grey-scales, print just eighteen samples: 5%, 10%, 15%...

95%. This will be plenty. Fourth: Styles do NOT work the same for all types of fonts handled by PageStream. (I must qualify this by saying that I am currently using PageStream version 2.1 as this is a program bug that I am sure will be corrected in future releases.) For example, "Shadow" is a very beautiful style available from the "Style" menu. But the "shadow" effect, when used on a Compugraphic font, will create a shadow slightly to the right of the outlined character. With Soft-Logic fonts or PostScript fonts, the shadow will be created slightly to the right AND BELOW the outlined character - which is the way it is supposed to work. Another small bug is related to either the "Shadow" or "Outline" styles. With a Compugraphic font, the center or white portion of outlined character is transparent. That is, if you place it over another pattern or anything else, whatever is beneath it will show through. With other font types the center is opaque as it should be. In short, if you don't get the effect you want, try another type of font.

Lots of choices. Setting up all those choices · can be time-consuming. But it doesn't have to be. PageStream allows you to set up Tags. A Tag is nothing but a collection of text attributes which is given a name and which then can be applied to a section of text ALL AT ONCE. Take a look at the "Tags" requester pictured. In the block at the left are the Tags which I have previously defined and saved in a file called "NLTAGS". When I begin to edit a newsletter, I call up the Tags requester, select the "Append" gadget, and select my file of Tag definitions via the file requester. Then I just click on the desired set of attributes. The Tag called "Body" is the one currently selected as seen from the name in the "Tag:" block at the top. And along the right side are the attributes associated with this Tag. As you can see, the font is "CS Century Schoolbook", the size is 9 pt, the spacing is 2 pt, the paragraph indent is .25 inches (approx.) and "auto justification" is active. Note that I do not specify a style. By not specifying a style, I can italicize or embolden portions of the text without having to define another Tag. Anything not specified by the Tag will not be changed. I can "un-tag" a portion of text at any time. This is sometimes desirable to avoid having to make special Tags for every little purpose. To un-tag text, highlight it using one of the two methods you know so well, select the "Tag" item from the "Text" menu, and then blank out the Tag name (or use ESC to blank it with a

This is the Tag requester. Note that virtually all text attributes are available here.

single keystroke).

So how to make a tag? First, give it a name. Then select the attributes that you want to be associated with the text by clicking on the descriptions of the attributes at the right of the requester. Note that virtually ALL of the text modifiers are available. Requesters will pop up to make your choices easy. When you are done specifying the attributes for your Tag, just click on the "Add" gadget to add the Tag to the list. (If you forget to click on the "Add" gadget before exiting the Tags requester you get to do it over again.) You can exit the Tags requester by clicking on the "OK" gadget. If you want to save your current set of Tags in a file to be used again, be sure to click on the "Save" gadget before exiting the program.

The Fill Style requester. There are 40 pre-defined fill patterns.

This is a sample of one of my Character Test pages. It shows which characters are available for this typeface and what the respective ASCII values are. Incidentally, I captured this page by PRINTING TO AN IFF FILE from PageStream and then importing the graphic.

Changing a Tag is just as easy - but it is a little prone to error due to the way PageStream has implemented the function. Select the Tag to be changed and change whatever attributes you want to. Then click on the "Add" gadget. That's the tricky part. If you forget to click on the "Add" gadget (even though you are not adding anything) your changes will not take. Note that when you change an existing Tag, the entire document will be changed. It will make no difference what is highlighted at the time - everywhere that Tag has been used the text will assume the new attributes.

That's it. Next month be ready for a new topic.

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks by Bill Raecke

SuperDuper is a new disk copy utility. It is designed to copy standard floppies only. That being the case, you might wonder why it deserves mention. The answer is SPEED. This copy program is fast. Until now I have been using DFC 4. DFC 4 has been able to lay claim to being the ONLY disk copy program to be as reliable as the standard AmigaDOS DiskCopy. In addition it added some terrific extra features not allowed by DiskCopy such as the ability to copy a disk to RAM and then to make multiple copies without re-reading the original, and the ability to make multiple copies (to more than one drive) at once. Well, SuperDuper has all those features too. Plus the ability to use FMS (the hard drive floppy simulator) or RAD (when configured to floppy size) as the source. Plus that SPEED that I mentioned earlier. To get an actual comparison I ran some speed tests. All tests are with the "verify" option turned on.

As you can see SuperDuper is remarkably fast. And in all the tests I have run so far I have had no problems with the reliability of the disks it produces. There does seem to be one program bug - not affecting reliability. When there are external floppies in the system, it will not work without a disk in DFO:. A rather strange bug, and one that will hopefully be corrected. At any rate, if you need a reliable and fast copy program, give this one a try. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_293.

## Pictures

This is a good month for building up YOUI picture collections. On MCCC-A. 294 you'll find a couple of SHAM

(Sliced HAM) pictures called "Alamo" and "Truck". And on MCCC-A\_295 you'll find "Husky", "MRLake", "Vermont2", and "Yoda". These are all of excellent quality and well worth adding to your collection. Of course the picture viewer is included on the disks so that all you need to do is click on the icon to see them.

## RexxARPLib 3.0 by W.G.J. Langeveld

This is the library that many of us have been using for some time now with ARexx. This was the first library to make all the Amiga Intuition functions (Menus, gadgets, drawing tools, screens, windows, file requesters, etc.) available to the ARexx programmer. The addition of this library makes ARexx a full-featured Amiga programming language. This is version 3.0. Version 3.0 makes the library totally compatible with AmigaDOS 2.0 and adds a few new features. It still works just fine with AmigaDOS 1.3, too. I have had no problems with my system since upgrading. If you use ARexx you should have this library. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_295.

The animation is so big it won't fit on a floppy. Yes, you'll find it on MCCC-A\_296, but it is in LZH archive format. To use it, you'll need to unarchive it to a hard drive (or a highdensity floppy). It will also require at least 2 meg of memory to run. If you can meet the minimum requirements, get it. You'll love it.

## Amiga Beginner's Class

Saturday. June 8th, there will be (or was if your postman was slow delivering your newsletter) a class designed for novice users of the Amiga. The topics discussed in this class include: basic hardware, add on hardware, Workbench, AmigaDOS, and software. There will be ample time allowed for individual questions and answers. The class will be held at the North Richland Hills Recreation Center (the same location as Amiga-By-TheLoop chapter meetings) from 10:00 AM through 1:00 PM. There is a $5 registration fee. Contact Harold Williams at 483-0537 (or use the BBS) for registration information. If this notice came too late (you skipped the meetings last month and haven't called the BBS recently) there are future classes planned.

## New Newsletter Deadline

Beginning with the next issue of the MCCC News, the deadline for submission of articles and advertisements will be moved to 7am on the fourth Saturday of the month. This should make it easier on chapter reporters because it should ensure that all chapter meetings have taken place by the time the newsletter deadline rolls around.

But - a word of caution. This tighter schedule puts a bigger burden on me, your trusty editor. I am allowing myself just Saturday and Sunday to put together the newsletter and print it so that it can be taken to the print shop on Monday morning. Because of this tight schedule, I will not accept ANY articles submitted past the deadline. I will check the MCCC BBS and StarText for the last time when I get up on Saturday morning. Anything not submitted by then will not be considered for inclusion in the current newsletter - including chapter news.

One last thing. Just because the deadline is the fourth Saturday doesn't mean that you need to wait until then to submit an article. Just as in voting submit early and submit often. It will help me a lot. Thanks.

At our May meeting, Dave Owens gave our monthly Share Ware Demo of Handy Icons. This "handy" little utility allows you to call up programs from a menu listing and run them without having to load Workbench and click on the icons. Handy Icons can be inserted in your startup-sequence and builds a details.

Don't forget next month, June 11th, we plan to have Bill Raecke give a demonstration on PageStream, version 2.1. Just look at your newsletter for a preview sample of what it can do. See you there.

Well, if you weren't there (and the new version. It was entertaining and informative - and it kept EVERYONE glued to their seats until late into the evening, which is no small feat.

For a capper to the evening, we were treated to a short demonstration of our own Aaron Hightower's new Tetris clone called Yet Another Tetris Clone or YATC for short. It's beautifully done with a couple of neat features not available in other clones, including the ability

When creating this information in the Handy Icons tool window, you need to enter the program name and its entire pathname for each program desired in the listing. It works most efficiently with a harddrive system. You will find Handy Icons on our library disk SuperDisk WB Util 2.

an awfully lot of you weren't), you missed another terrific meeting. We had the first presentation ANYWHERE of the new CanDo ver. 1.5. The reason we were able to do so is that Harold Williams, our presenter, was able to get an advance copy from INOVAtronics about a week prior to the ship date. We watched him as he put together a simple application and then listened as he told us what new and wonderful features were available in

Our regular program presentation was on Ham-E given by Chris Scheers. Ham-E (distributed by Black Belt Software) works similarly to DCTV in that it allows you to create simulated 24 bit color images (DCTV creates real 24 bit color images). These images can then be edited with a paint program and output as an RGB video signal. You can also work with ray-tracing and animation using Ham-E as long as you have sufficient memory (minimum of 2 Megs) for your system. It consists of a simple rectangular box (not much larger than an external drive) and operating software with utility programs on disk. The system connects between your video output port and your monitor and retails for about $300. Chris gave a very impressive presentation of a very capable package.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

No, Amiga North Dallas did not disappear from the club last month... your everlovin' Secretary put off all her procrastinatin' 'til the last minute and failed to get the article in by the Print Date. Sorry... Ill try not to let it happen again. Here's a brief summary of what you WOULD have seen:

April showers may bring May flowers, but they also brought a bunch of damp Amigaphiles to our April meeting! Thanks for your devotion, the many who braved the storm that night (including lots of new visitors)! Hope the weather will be better for our picnic on May 11th! [It was... a Nice Time Had By All. You shoulda' been there, if you weren't.] We began with the newsand-rumors department: Brett Hester shared news of an Amigaunder-wraps coming from NEWTEK. A compacted Workbench is being considered for development by club members for those still struggling

Please note that on Saturday, June 8th, there is an Amiga Users Class at the North Richland Hills Community Center. Contact Harold Williams for more information and

with floppy systems... watch for more news, or come express interest at the meeting. Remember the mouse switches coming in for 50 cents each? They're in (by now) and are available to other chapters as well. Watch the BBS. Our fifth annual Users' Convention, METCOM, is scheduled for October 5th, and plans are underway now. Did you know CNN and Headline News have been heard talking about the Amiga's multimedia capabilities? Brett Hester also resource, etc. Data access is extremely fast... as George put it, you just "beam the data up"! Look for encyclopedias, dictionaries and an illustrated world atlas, games from Sierra, children's stories with audio effects, language lessons, etc. Imagine clicking on a country on a map and hearing its national anthem as we view the sights of the capital... the future is coming sooner than we think. Yes, it WILL play plain ol' CD's, too! The CD can hold 500

Commodore "Power Up Program"? If you bring in the COVER from the ORIGINAL OWNERS MANUAL from any other Commodore computer, you can get $1500 off an Amiga 3000! (You even get to keep the old computer and the rest of the manual!)

told us about a spectacular animation done on the Amiga for a fraction of the cost of a "professional" studio. The Video SIG was meeting again on 4/25, and the Programming SIG is still alive. Check in at the meeting or on the BBS about their status. Our good librarian William sez there are 10 new Fred Fish disks and 10 new club disks now in the library. He brought along the Superdisks, the new ones, and about the last year's worth of "old" disks for our convenience at the meeting. Can't beat this system!

megabytes. Imagine the possibilities! Expected for under $1000.

A sad footnote: We in the Amiga North Dallas chapter are especially devastated by the sudden death of Amazing Computers. The guys at Amazing have been our neighbors, friends, staunch supporters, generous suppliers and all-round Good Folks. They will be sorely missed, and we hope somehow a new Amiga store will rise from the ashes.

Our PD Pick of the Month (April) was DFC (No, not Dallas Fried Chicken or D*** Fine Copier, it's Disk Format Copy, I think). This utility makes consistently good copies, singly or up to 4 at a time, by reading the entire disk into memory. Good for copying a backups, or supplying mass copies to a club library! By the way, Somebody Else wrote DFC5... be sure you get DFC4, "the Real Thing". Thanks, Harold, for another good explanation.

At last, George Heiser presented the eagerly awaited CDTV. You know, I'm STILL not sure if it's an Amiga with a CD in it, or a CD with an Amiga in it, but it sure is neat! You can plug a regular drive in back and actually boot on regular Amiga software (although a keyboard isn't available yet), but this device is not being marketed as a "real computer", not to scare the "iggerant savages" out there. Instead, it's a game machine, an entertainment device, an on-line and interactive reference

NOW for the May report: We got to admire the new Toaster brochure as it was passed around... very flashy (included the new Clone). The Video Sig was planning a meeting at Simuflite on May 25 (Brett Hester has info on the SIG if you're interested, (214) 233-5493). The Programming SIG is getting back together after originator Kevin Wanbsganz's recent move. New phone number for interested programmer types: (214) 414-9460. Metropolitan now has CanDo 1.5 available for around $120. If you already have CanDo, Inovatronics offers an upgrade for $40. Danny Barnett is taking an Amiga to the "Conflicts" gaming convention at the Plano Holiday Inn, June 22-23. If you want to participate, call the gaming coordinator, Doug at 3212546. They're seeking computer game players/operators etc. In the sad wake of Amazing's departure, Metropolitan has drastically increased its Amiga stock, and has welcomed several former Amazing staff members to its ranks. Hooray! Have you heard about the

By-the Loop chapter meets. The cost is only $5, and it will be taught by the inestimable Harold Williams (Explainer Extraordinary). He plans to cover basic hardware, the mysterious "C Directory" , the Startup Sequence, libs, devices, fonts, Workbench, icons, windows... all those things you see all the time but are afraid to ask about. For those of us on the other side of the world, we HOPE to schedule a class over here in the future.

Now for THE DEMO: Forrest McKinney of Metropolitan Computers presented a very wellorganized and informative demonstration of most of the available 24 bit high-density graphics display devices/software out for the Amiga. DCTV is a little box that connects between any Amiga and its monitor and produces composite output. Disk files for a 24bit graphics image in the new standard IFF24 format are huge, taking 700K to 2 megabytes to store. DCTV has its own internal format that drastically reduces the disk usage (the sample image was only 200K). The software can accept and translate HAM, IFF, and IFF24 formatted files for display and manipulation. It comes with a "pretty good" paint program with some unique features (but no UNDO button... arrrg!). DCTV "requires" one meg of RAM but really needs 3 meg to be productive. Loading and saving are very fast, but on a 68000 special effects, digitizing, etc. are slow. Doesn't work with a genlock,

but if you can supply a still composite input it can digitize directly. Quite a gadget for retail $495. The famous Video Toaster does a lot of the same things but displays cleaner, sharper video. You get what you pay for... $1595 retail. The Toaster card fits in the Amiga 2000 series video slot. It can grab MOVING video shots, vs. the DCTV frame-grabber capability. And of course there are all those neat transitions etc. that the Toaster is famous for. Then there's HAM-E,

Local Dealers... uh, Dealer! We get so much support and cooperation from them, we owe them our patronage! Next month: 3rd Wednesday, June 19th, same time, same place. We hope to see Eric Schwartz' "Anti-Lemming Demo", and Brett's tape of an incredible Video Toaster animation. The Main Dish Demo is being planned... watch the BBS or check with us closer to the meeting for the latest.

which produces RGB output at the higher resolution. It's a bigger box than DCTV, with a Mysterious Switch on it that has no documented or apparent purpose. This device is NOT for video output purposes... just for working with Hi-Res graphics on your own system display. It loads the IFF24 format files and translates them to RGB. HAM-E has a paint program and an ARexx port. It won't work on a 3000, by the way - 5002500 only. It's very s 1 o w, and all the documentation comes on floppy and is very confusing. It's $495 retail. There's a $295 lo-res version, but why? Mentioned but not shown was "Firecracker 24", the "best hi-res display program on the market" (sez Forrest). At $1599, it displays 1024 X 512 resolution for the A2000-A3000 machines. Also mentioned: "Colorburst", seen at shows and offered for sale since November but still not apparently available for real. Commodore is expected to release an 8-bit color graphics device for under $2000, which will work with the UNIX machine, speeding up the display and adding color. Highly recommended for use with all the hires displays: Art Department Professional (needs 3 meg) for creation and manipulation of the images.

Blake Brown gave a fine demonstration of Cataloger, the utility used to create the catalog (index) for the MCCC 64/128 disk library. Cataloger is included on each of the six disk sides comprising the club library's catalog. It can be used to view and print a directory of any of the 300+ disks in the library. Cataloger was provided to the MCCC by Sof-Tex and reportedly originated in Commodore Houston Users Group (CHUG). An individual may use the program to create a catalog of his own collection of disks, but other programs are available which include the capability of searching for a file by type of title. One of these is Fast Finder on MCCC disk 321.

MCCC disks 337 and 338 were also recommended for C64 utilities, including disk jacket printing! These are not new programs, but are useful tools for old hands and helpful for new hands.

Our new home (meeting place) is Grand Prairie Memorial Library on Conover Drive, next door west of the Police Station. Next meeting is on June 11 with an early start time of 6:30 pm. The program will be "Disk Doctoring"

newer members were unaware of its existence and were definitely interested.

Most of our May meeting was devoted to discussions on new items and ideas, and trouble shooting on various programs. With the help of other members, I learned why I was unable to use my Partner 64 cartridge. Would you believe I hadn't inserted it far enough into the slot?

Donald Tate gave us a demonstration of Disk # 534 - HAL (Home Accounting System). Try this if you haven't already. It's a very useful combination of database, phone number list, grocery shopping list, bank account program, etc.

Our attendance was good helped by the nice weather, I guess. Let's make it even better next time on the 8th of June.

There was a demonstration on Vizastar 128 at the June meeting. It has the best database written for the C128. The main features include a spreadsheet, database and graphics. It is easy to operate. Use the tutorial book to get you started.

The next meeting will be on July 6 at 1:30 pm at the Hurst Recreation Center.

The MCCC Spring Thing was fantastic! It was quite windy but lots of fun. There was lots of talking with friends from other chapters and even a boat ride around Grapevine Lake.
