## Squeezing Color From a DeskJet

by Bill Raecke

W ant to make all your friends who own laser printers green with envy? Nothing will spoil their days more quickly than the sight of a color image produced on a black and white Hewlett Packard DeskJet. That's right... it is now possible to produce full color images from what you thought was strictly a black and white printer. Want to know the secret?

First, the theory. Full color printing today is done using the technique of "four color separation". This is the method used to produce magazines, books, posters, color pictures in newspapers... virtually all full-color printing. The process involves separating an image into its four primary colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black - hence the term "four color separation". A more specific term is a CMYK separation. (That's right - the K stands for black.) Any color can be created by combining those four colors in various combinations. Green is a combination of cyan and yellow, blue is a combination of cyan and magenta, red is a combination of magenta and yellow, etc. Colors are mixed using the halftone process and printing each color on the page separately. (Halftone is a process by which a grid is established - perhaps 4 by 4 dots - and a shade is determined by how many of those dots within the grid pattern are filled in.) This is probably clear as mud at this point, but I hope it will become a little clearer as we get into more detail in a minute.

colors - including black. You also get a bottle of cleaner with which to clean out your old, used Desket ink cartridges. That's the next thing you need... some old, used DeskJet ink cartridges. That can take a while. Once you gather the necessary materials together the "fun" begins. I use the term fun advisedly because, although the end result is astounding, getting there is anything BUT fun.

What we need first is some ink. If we are going to do a CMYK separation we're going to need some cyan, magenta and yellow ink. No problem. For this we can run down to our trusty Metropolitan Computer store and purchase a kit from Inkmun Inks. It's called the Full Color Printing System for DeskJet. (Other stores may have the kit as well... but that's where I got mine.) What you get in the kit is a container of each of the primary

Here's the way cleaning out the cartridges works. The cleaner is supplied in a small plastic accordion-style bottle that holds one ounce of cleaning fluid. At the open end is a small brass tube that will fit down into the hole in the top of the ink cartridge. The idea is to put the brass tube into the hole and "...gently squeeze the bottle from the bottom to cause fluid to drip from the cartridge print head (at the bottom of the cartridge) at a rate of one to three drops per second. When the bottle is empty, press the tip of the bottle closer to the cartridge so that the plastic is firmly against the cartridge and pump air through the cartridge to force the remaining fluid out and continue until no more fluid drips from the print head." That quotation is from the instruction sheet. Now, here's the way it really works. You start pushing the fluid gently into the cartridge waiting for it to start dripping from the print head. That never happens. Instead, the cartridge fills up and the cleaning fluid starts to squirt out the hole in the top. Since the idea is to get it to flow through the cartridge, the only course of action is to go to step two and start forcing the fluid through. The problem here is that the plastic that you are supposed to seat firmly against the cartridge doesn't fit tightly and as you force the fluid through, some of it will squirt out the top. FUN. OK, that step is finished. Of course, by now there is ink all over the kitchen sink and cleaner fluid

everywhere and, if you bought this product as a result of this review, you will be cursing the day you ever read it. Now it's time to refill the cartridge and go again. After all, there are more cartridges - and the one which will hold the yellow ink needs to be done twice. With your kit is a large bottle of cleaner fluid with which to refill the little accordion bottle. But wait - how does the accordion bottle open? You'll be one up on me here 'cause I'll let you in on the secret. The center of the top pops out (the end with the brass tube in it) with the aid of pliers. The instruction sheet fails to mention it. It was a lot more fun (and about ten minutes) trying to figure it out. By the end of the second go-around, the plastic bottle will begin to deteriorate from all the pressure you are exerting on it to try to force air and fluid through the cartridge. The squirting from the top will get worse. You will begin cursing the day I was born.

The cartridge will not last though all five uses. Somewhere into the fourth application, the small brass tube will poke a hole in the plastic bottle, fluid will squirt all over the place, the brass tube will fall into the garbage disposal, you will resort to blowing into the cartridge to force the remaining ink and fluid through, and (between puffs) you will begin cursing the day my parents met - if I had parents. As for the last cartridge... it's for black ink and really doesn't need to be cleaned anyway, does it?

By this time your hands will be covered with ink and the sink will be a mess. But now we can start filling our clean cartridges with new ink. Truth is, the worst is over. Each color of tink comes in its own accordion bottle with a much longer brass tube. This one gets inserted deep into a sponge on the inside of the cartridge and you begin gently squeezing the ink into it until "ink drips from the print head at the bottom of the cartridge". Of course, this never happens, ink instead comes out of the top of the cartridge when it is full, your hands get some brightly colored markings to contrast with the black and you begin to think about sending a hit squad to my house. But let's let bygones be bygones (please). It's time to start printing.

Cleaning and filling the cartridges is the bad news. Printing is the good news. The next thing you need to start printing is a program to do the color separation. The best one to use (in my opinion) is PageStream. It is the only one of the three major desktop publishers that will do a color separation to a non-Postscript printer. If you use Professional Page or Saxon Publisher you will need to take your output through a Postscript interpreter first. Here's all it takes. Bring your picture into PageStream, position and size it, and select "Print". In the "Print" requester is an option called "4-Color Separation". Select it. The first color to be generated is cyan - they are generated in the CMYK sequence - so put the cartridge containing the cyan ink into the DeskJet and start the print process. After the cyan pass is finished, press the ON LINE button on the printer to make sure it doesn't start again before you are ready, replace the cartridge with the one containing magenta ink, place the paper back into the input tray, and press ON LINE again. Repeat this for the yellow and black ink and you're done. The Desk/et is able to position the paper accurately so that each pass is positioned exactly as it should be - directly over the last pass. (The accruate positioning of the paper is known as registration.) The process will take four times as long as it would to print a gray-scale picture... on my computer the whole process takes about seven minutes.

What is really taking place is that each of those color passes is printing a halftone image on the paper. If the

## Using a normal Screen Frequency of 75 for the halftone, the DeskJet can easily produce 65,536 colors.

halftone "Screen Frequency" is set to 75 (for a four by four grid) there will be sixteen shades of cyan, sixteen shades of magenta, etc. That means that the total number of colors that the printer is able to reproduce at that Screen Frequency is sixteen to the power of four - or 65,536 colors. If your Screen Frequency is set lower, you can have even more colors. That makes reproducing all 4,096 Amiga colors easy. And it means that a 24-bit image produced in one of the many possible sources can be printed much more faithfully. For comparison purposes, the HP PaintJet can only produce about 1,000 colors - at twice the price.

Are there any drawbacks? Not really. But there is one more observation I need to make. The colors produced by this process (as described so far) are not perfectly true. This is most likely due to variations in manufacturing of the ink, but it could also be that my cartridges weren't cleaned sufficiently, or it could even be a color bias in PageStream. Whatever it is, the pictures I produce show a definite red bias. To correct this, I take all pictures into The Art Department to manipulate their colors before taking them into PageStream. This is not a big problem since all pictures should be adjusted to brighten them before printing on a Deskjet anyway - even when printing a gray-scale image. Through many (MANY) trials I have found that the following settings yield the most consistently pleasing results, although individual pictures may still need tweaking for optimum accuracy.

Red -15

Green +12

Blue +20

Bright + 8

Gamma +50

If the color error is an ink or a cartridge problem, your results may vary - but try those numbers as a starting point.

The printing process is rather painless once you have your ink cartridges filled. And the results are simply amazing. You may soon convince your laser-owning buddies to trade up to a Desket.

## Understanding Your AMIGA

Making room on Workbench by Harold Williams

A miga users who are lucky enough to own a hard drive usually keep all of the original Workbench files and add lots of other utilities. Floppy drive users need to delete some of the original Workbench files to make room for other utilities. My Workbench 1.3 has only 26352 bytes of storage free. Deleting some of the less useful files can easily free up over 300000 bytes of storage. Remember, never modify your original Workbench disk. It should be write protected (the little window opened) and stored in a safe place. All modifications should be done on a copy of the original.

Many files included on Workbench are essential and cannot be removed. The files that can be removed fall into two categories: 1) files that can be deleted using Workbench (they have icons) and 2) files that require using the CLI (Shell) or a utility for deletion (they do not have icons).

Files that can be removed using Workbench include the entire Preferences drawer, most of the contents of the utilities drawer, and InitPrinter, MergeMem, and NoFastMem from the System drawer. You might need to keep some of these files depending on how you use your system.

People often are surprised to discover that the entire Preferences drawer can be removed. Most Amiga users adjust the settings in Preferences and then rarely change those settings. If you don't use Preferences frequently and you need the space, why not remove the entire drawer? Preferences occupies about 66000 bytes of space. If you decide to remove it (you are working on a copy!), simply highlight the Preferences drawer and select "Discard" from the Workbench menu. If you choose to remove the entire contents of the Utility drawer you will recover about 136000 bytes of disk space. You should seriously consider keeping the More, GraphicDump and Calculator programs. More is a text file browser utility and is often used to display instructions and help files. If you remove it, you should be prepared to replace it with another similar utility (PPMore, MuchMore and QView are very nice and available from the club library and BBS). GraphicDump is a simple way to print graphics on your printer. Calculator is, of course, a nice little on screen calculator utility. If you decide to keep these three utilities you will still free up 108000 bytes by removing the other utility programs. If you decide to delete all of the Utility programs, I recommend that you keep the drawer itself as a convenient place to store other utilities (that's why we're doing this!). The System drawer

![Image](1991_09_artifacts/image_000005_0189f0eb2fbee92f4025c923a55656d684ecb13e561cf752d428e59281755a86.png)

contains files that are vital to the operation of your Amiga. It is best not to mess around with this drawer, but if you are desperate for another 10000 bytes of space, you can delete the programs named InitPrinter, MergeMem, and NoFastMem.

If you have deleted the files discussed above you now have a Workbench disk with as much as 235000 bytes of free disk space. If you crave even more room you will have to use the dreaded CLI or a file/directory utility. Although Amiga users continue to use the expression "CLI", the original Command Line Interface has been greatly enhanced by the Amiga Shell. Open the Shell by double clicking on the Shell icon. Move the Shell window and use the sizing gadget to create a large window.

You can recover over 90000 bytes of disk space by deleting the fonts directory. The fonts directory contains seven different bit-mapped typefaces. None of these are required by the system, but word processors and paint programs usually will allow you to use them. If you use fonts in this manner you might want to keep them on your Workbench and in fact might want to add other fonts (there are a couple on the Extras disk and a bazillion of them in the club library). A better way to handle fonts is to keep a disk named FONTS filled with the fonts you like to use. When a disk named FONTS is inserted in a drive the Amiga will automatically use that disk for its default font directory instead of the fonts directory on Workbench. If that system sounds workable to you or if you just don't need all these system fonts, here is the way to delete them. First type the command "LIST FONTS:" (don't type the quotes) and press the return key (the big key with the bent arrow). You should see a list of font names. The original Workbench includes diamond, emerald, garnet, opal, ruby, sapphire, and topaz. You can remove these font files one at a time using the command "DELETE FONTS:DIAMOND#? ALL" and "DELETE FONTS:EMERALD#? ALL" etc. If you want to remove all of them, the command "DELETE FONTS:#? ALL" will do the job.

The Amiga has a directory named C that contains most of commands that are used during the boot sequence and used from the CLI (like LIST and DELETE). Most of the commands included in the C directory are necessary or are very small and do not use much disk space. Three commands are worth consideration for deletion. ED and EDIT are both simple text editors. DISKDOCTOR is a utility designed to recover data from a damaged disk. ED and EDIT are both very primitive editors. MicroEMACS

## AMOS

Save your money by Allen W. Wadle purchased AMOS, The Creator, version 1.2, from The Listerpreto eat had a lowing is he say ·(interpreter) that had a glowing review in the July issue of Amiga World. This purchaser rates it as a piece of trash.

After making the purchase I took over a week to carefully review the manual. I have to admit that I came away impressed with what the language could supposedly do. There are over 500 commands. There are commands to load an IFF screen, load and play sound files, and load and play music files. After installing the language and trying to write and run some programs of my own I have a vastly different opinion. I have encountered the following problems:

- (2) "PRINT USING" appears to not properly handle multiple items in an I/O list. You have to break the statement up into separate "PRINT USING" commands terminated by semicolons.
- (1) The "LLIST" command to list a program to the line printer doesn't work. You get an "illegal direct mode" when you try it. The only way to get a listing is from the editor menu to mark the top and bottom of the program as the starting and ending points for a block, and then choose "block print".
- (3) When you start a new file and then want to save it, you cannot give it a file name and have it save it as that. It will reply "File Not Found" and not save it. Obviously the file isn't there if it is a new file! The

## Understanding Your Amiga Continued From Page 5

on the Extras disk is a much better editor and there are several very nice editors available from the club library. Delete ED by typing the command "DELETE C:ED" and delete EDIT with the command "DELETE C:EDIT". If you need an editor, copy MicroEMACS or one of the freely distributable editors into your Utility drawer. DISKDOCTOR sounds like a useful utility to have on your system. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well and you should replace it with a utility named DiskSalv (again available through the club). Delete DISKDOCTOR with the command "DELETE C:DISKDOCTOR". Removing these three files will release about 47000 bytes of space.

If you need just a few more bytes of disk space you might consider deleting the Workbench Trashcan, the Expansion drawer and even the Empty drawer. Together they occupy about 9000 bytes of space. The Trashcan is basically useless to a floppy user and is of dubious value to a hard disk user. The Trashcan is unique in having an program will respond like this for either the "SAVE" or "SAVE AS" menu options for a new file. It appears that the only way to save a brand new file is to duplicate an old one, rename it, and then bring it into the editor and delete everything in it and start over.

- (4) 'The program appears to have a really hard time with arithmetic. The problem doesn't show up as wrong answers or a "bombout" when the math is being done though. What happens is that the program hangs on "INPUT" statements. The hangup is such that the only recovery is to cycle power.

The following small program is an example of what AMOS can't do.

Input "Enter a floating point number:",XVALUE# YVALUE#=XVALUE#*2.467 PRINT YVALUE#

When this program is run, it will print the prompt for the INPUT, and then if you respond with "2.35" followed by RETURN, the program will hang up. I have encountered cases where changing one statement just a little bit will make the computer hang up when the program is run. It is really frustrating to be developing a program, add a few lines of code, and have it end up hanging up when it isn't your fault.

The problems I have had with AMOS make me wonder if the reviewers actually wrote and tried to run any programs of their own. I guess that it's possible that it's just version 1.2 that is so buggy and temperamental. All I know is that AMOS 1.2 is a good way to waste a lot of money ($80 at The Edge, $55 mail order) on a computer language that will present you with more problems than it will solve.

icon, but not being deletable from Workbench (try it). You can delete the Trashcan from the CLI. Use the command "DELETE SYS:Trashcan#?". The Expansion and Empty drawers can be deleted from the Workbench. The Expansion drawer is normally empty. If you have a hard drive or other special devices added to your Amiga, the Expansion drawer will possibly contain files that are vital to the operation of those devices. If you have a plain Amiga 500 or 2000, then it is safe to delete this drawer. The Empty drawer certainly should be empty. Its purpose is to provide you with an easy method of producing other drawers. Duplicating the Empty drawer is the standard method of creating a new drawer. Deleting the Empty drawer will mean that you will need a utility to create new drawers or you will have to obtain Empty drawers from a disk other than this Workbench.

If you have deleted all the files suggested in this article, you will have as much as 365000 bytes of free disk space on your copy of Workbench. This is not the goal. The goal is to have a Workbench filled to the brim with utilities that you really use. Now the real work begins!

Public domain and shareware picks by Bill Raecke

This is one of those little programs which, if you have a hard drive, you've probably always wanted, but didn't have. Its primary purpose is to mount a SCSI that is slow in coming up. This might apply to a SyQuest or even a slow Seagate drive. What it means is that those drives, which might not be ready at boot time, can now be mounted after the fact by using this command. What it does is scan the RigidDiskBlock area of the disk for the information required to mount it. The program requires that the controller support direct SCSI commands and the RigidDiskBlock standard. It may not work with all controllers, but Commodore, Microbotics and GVP all work fine.

That's what the program was written for. But it's good for other things as well. With the new controllers, the decision as to whether or not to automount a particular partition is stored in the RigidDiskBlock area of the disk. If there are partitions that you use infrequently and would just as soon not have mounted on a regular basis taking up valuable RAM, you must mark them as non-automount partitions with the software that came with your controller. That means that if you want them again, you must go back into the controller software, mark the partitions as automount and then re-boot your Amiga. This is a pain. LateSCSIMount offers a better solution. If your partitions are marked non-automount and you issue the LateSCSIMount command, all the partitions which were non-automount partitions will be mounted. In order to make their icons visible on Workbench at this point, you will need to access them with a CLI command.

But it gets even more flexible than that. When you initiate the LateSCSIMount command, the command will build a file in the RAM: device that contains a mountlist for all of the partitions it just mounted. Take that file (called mountlist.lsm) and append it onto the end of your "DEVS:Mountlist" file. Now you can issue a "Mount" command and mount only the specific partitions that you want mounted. And it gets even better. In the mountlist that LateSCSIMount creates will be the entry "Mount-0". If you change that entry to "Mount=1" then Workbench will immediately display the icon for the partition after the "Mount" command is issued without your having to access it in some way.

Now I know that, to some of you, this seems like a giant step backwards. After all, our controllers finally progressed past the need for issuing "Mount" commands. Automounting drives are simpler to use. That is true of course, but until a way is provided to manually mount a partition on the fly that you had specified as a nonautomount partition, this provides a very workable solution. You'll find it on MCCC-A 328.

PicBase is an IFF picture data base program. Do you have bunches and bunches of pictures in your collection? So many that you can't keep up with where they all are? Well, PicBase may just be able to help out. Point the program to a directory containing pictures, press a button, and the pictures are automatically scanned and catalogued. The powerful thing is that the program not only stores the names of the pictures, it stores a reduced size, monochrome representation of the picture as well so you can see what the picture looks like. Powerful sort and search features are provided as is lots of other neat stuff. Here is a partial list of the features provided.

## PicBase by Mike Berro

- Stores and displays full pathname, file size, creation date, filenote, image specifications and time code for each image.
- Scans directories and disks automatically. Updates data automatically.
- Fast image shrink and color remap on all Amiga graphic modes, including HAM and Halfbright.
- Cuts, copies and pastes IFF data.
- Sorts the images by pathname, filename, creation date, file size or time code.
- Search for any image.
- Automatic double-buffered slide show.
- Animation preview of miniature images.
- On-line help: In Help Mode you can click on any gadget and get a full description of what it does.

PicBase is a very well done program. I have seen many commercial programs that were far less impressive. Mike has released this as shareware and is requesting a $25 donation. Picase is well worth it. You'll find it on MCCC-A \_328.

## Pictures

As always, this month has some new pictures added to the library. Actually there are very few but they are worth the trouble. Check out Cardinal and Outgunned on MCCC-A\_323.

## Using PageStream

Productivity and Printing by Bill Raecke

1 his month's chapter in the Using PageStream series will cover two topics - and when we're done, the series will be complete. So far we've covered fonts, graphics and general document handling. Next we need to cover a few of the productivity features included in PageStream or what I like to call "Things to make your life easier"

The first productivity feature is PageStream's "View" capabilities. PageStream has much more powerful document viewing options than I have seen in other programs. There is a "View" menu that controls what you see or don't see on the screen. The amount of a document visible on the screen can vary from two facing pages to a 1500% magnification. (The accompanying screen shot shows a 1500% magnification of a few lines of text from last month's newsletter.) In addition, rulers, grid lines, bit-mapped graphics, tabs, column outlines, etc. can all be turned on or off. Another feature you will notice on this menu is thel "Set Greeking" item. "Greeking" refers to the practice of NOT displaying text on the screen below a certain point size. Be aware that in this instance, point size refers to the number of vertical points that a character occupies on the screen - it has nothing to do with the point size of the text that was selected for use in the document. As you zoom out to look at more of your page at a time, the letters get smaller and smaller on the screen. When they pass the "Greeking" point, PageStream will no longer try to show you an accurate representation of what the characters will look like. The idea is that beyond a certain point, they will become illegible anyway. All that PageStream will show beyond that point is a series of lines that will show the position of the characters on the page. But for those running PageStream on a 68000 based Amiga there is an additional use for this feature. It is much easier for PageStream to show "Greeked" text than it is to display a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) representation. So to speed up those displays, set the "Greeking" to a higher point size and use WYSIWYG only when editing text.

that each page has a separate bleed area so it cannot be used as a general Pasteboard as in some other publishers. What is a bleed area? It really has two uses. A graphic or block of text can extend into the bleed area if desired so that a portion will not be printed. A more common use is simply to have a place to put objects as they are being rearranged on the page.

Now let's talk about the "bleed area". Every page in a PageStream document has a bleed area - but, by default, when a new document is created, the bleed area is set to the same size as the page itself. In order to see and use the bleed area, you need to adjust its size after the document is created. Under the "Layout" menu is an item called "Set Page Dimensions". Selecting this item will bring up a requester where you can re-size both the page and the associated bleed area. Note that changing sizes here will affect every page in the document. But also note

If this were a review I would be pointing out that ten is far too few macros to have active at one time, that entering data using an obscure script language is far too difficult a procedure and serves to reduce the value of macros in general, and that access by function key is far too limiting and obscure (What was it that F5 was supposed to do again? Can't tell by looking at the Macro Requester 'cause it's written in some silly script language!) I would point out that Turbotext has an extremely powerful macro processor with NO limit on the number of macros available, automatic recording of all actions to build a macro, and macro naming so that you don't forget what it does. If this were a review I would recommend to Soft-Logik that they try to emulate what Oxxi has provided in TurboText. But this isn't a review... so I won't go into all that. Besides, I'm being a little unfair comparing a desktop publisher to a text editor. What I will mention is that using the macros provided, even just ten of them, can save you lots of work - and if you only use a few, they are easy enough to remember. I use macros to do the standard search and replace actions

One of the most important productivity features in this or any other productivity program is Macros. A "Macro" is simply a way that a program provides a user to establish a set of standard functions which can be performed in sequence at the press of a key. A program gets measured in this regard by how many macros it can support, how easy they are to set up, and how easy they are to use. PageStream doesn't handle macros as well as it should but at least they are there - unlike some desktop publishers - and they can save you lots of time if you learn to use them and use them wisely. Let's cover the three aspects in turn. First, the number of macros. The number of macros is virtually unlimited, but you are allowed to have just ten active at a time. Macros are stored on disk in sets of up to ten. One of those sets can be designated as the "default" so that it gets loaded automatically at boot-up time. The remainder can be loaded in as desired. To set them up, you must enter commands from the PageStream scripting language into text gadgets. To use them you press the appropriate function key.

that I do on every document that I bring into Pagestream - such as replacing the double dash with an em-dash or replacing the dreaded three periods with the elipsis character.

N · discussion of PageStream or any desktop publishing package would be complete without covering printing. After all, the whole point of a desktop publisher is to print a document. PageStream offers the most versatile printing capabilities of any program I have seen - on any platform. Its major strength lies in the fact that all printers are treated equally. Other publishing programs limit some features to Postscript only... in fact some limit printing to Postscript exclusively (Saxon Publisher). But before we get into some of those capabilities and how to best use them we need a short (I hope) discussion on printers in general. Hopefully this will help clear up some of the misconceptions that many people have.

There are many kinds of printers available in today's market, but they can be thought of as being just two basic types. The oldest, and one rarely used any more, is the daisy-wheel printer. This was the original "letter quality" printer. It uses preformed characters like a typewriter to achieve a high quality print. It became popular in the days when there was no other option to achieve letter quality type. In today's market it is simply too limiting to be of much use. The same quality can be achieved more quickly and quietly using newer technology. But once we get beyond daisy-wheel printers there is just one kind left.

At the bottom of the printer scale are the nine-pin and 24-pin impact printers. Now, I am quite aware that many of today's impact printers are capable of "360 dots per inch" (dpi). All things being equal, that would make them more capable than laser printers which print at 300 dpi. But all things are not equal. The fact is, when an impact printer is printing at its highest density, the marks that it is putting on the paper overlap. The pins themselves are far too big to strike the paper in a different spot 360 times in the space of a single inch. What they do is to go over the same area, offset just slightly, and strike again until they have managed to strike or skip 360 spots in that linear inch thereby giving them the "360 dpi" capability... but don't believe it. The next up on the printer scale is the inkjet printer - the Hewlett Packard Desket being the premier example. Inkjet printers are capable of up to 300 dpi. This is a true 300 dpi. The printer is capable of squirting up to 300 separate and non-overlapping dots of ink in the space of a single linear inch. The only drawbacks to an inkjet printer are that the starting and stopping action of the paper feed mechanism tends to cause banding effects when doing graphics, and that the ink will soak into the paper somewhat causing those precisely placed dots to run together just a little, thereby reducing the effective resolution to something a little less than a 300 dpi output. (This effect can be minimized by

This screen shot shows the options available on the View menu. The text shown is a 1500% magnification of 9 point text.

![Image](1991_09_artifacts/image_000013_1832c5e45fc0fe4feb343588f3cf942caf3c27553c7ef0c00edfbb649ac794de.png)

Everything else is a "dotmatrix" printer. Now I know that this comes as a shock to a lot of people because over the years we have become accustomed to thinking in terms of daisy-wheel and dotmatrix where dot-matrix really meant "impact". That is because the first dot-matrix printers were, in fact, impact printers. Characters on an impact printer are formed by pins striking a ribbon which, in turn, strikes the paper making a mark. Today's 9-pin and 24-pin printers are impact printers. They are also dotmatrix, true - but so is everything else. Inkjet printers are dot-matrix printers. Laser printers are dot-matrix printers. And yes, even Postscript printers are dot-matrix printers. The only real difference between any of these printers is the number of dots per inch they are capable of producing and how they can place those dots on the paper. (I'm belaboring the point because I'm going to try to dispel a bit of the mystique involved with the word "Postscript". More on that later.)

the careful selection of the proper paper.) At the top of the printer scale are the laser printers - both Postscript and non-Postscript. A typical laser printer for home use produces a true 300 dpi output.

You may have noticed just now that I lumped all laser printers, both Postscript and non-Postscript, together. You will also notice that both types produce the same resolution - 300 dpi. So what is the difference? The difference is simply how information is sent to the printer. When using a Postscript printer, information is sent to the printer as text. A Postscript print file is simply an ASCII text file that contains a series of commands and information which the Postscript printer interprets and turns into a dot-matrix which is then printed. With a nonPostscript printer, the appropriate calculations have to be performed in the computer by the desktop publishing package (or Postscript interpreter such as PixelScript or Post) and then sent to the printer as a dot-matrix.

I've gone into all this build-up simply to make a point. You will read statements again and again to the effect that a Postscript printer is the best printer that money can buy and that everyone should want one. Since a Postscript printer is just a dot-matrix printer with the very same resolution as either a normal laser printer or a DeskJet, the question needs to be asked, "Why is Postscript better?" After all, the extra money that it costs to buy a Postscript printer - with its own CPU, Postscript interpreter and 2 megabytes of RAM - could easily be used by most of us for other purposes. A Postscript printer can cost double what a normal laser printer costs. And a normal laser printer will cost about double what a HP DeskJet costs. The question is whether a Postscript printer is worth the difference in price to you as a PageStream user. And to be able to answer that question you need to know the advantages that a Postscript printer offers. Here are the major differences. 1) If you are working professionally you will be sending your work out to a service bureau for final reproduction on a 1200 dpi or greater device. These devices understand and expect Postscript data. The ability to test at home on your own Postscript printer before you send it out will save a bunch of time, money and frustration. 2) The print quality of a Postscript printer will generally be slightly better than what PageStream currently produces on its own. There is no particular reason for this other than the fact that SoftLogik needs to work a little on their print algorithms. But you need to look awfully close to see the difference. For most of us the differences are slight enough that they don't matter. 3) A Postscript printer will normally print much faster than will PageStream on a 68000 based Amiga. Of course, if that is your only reason for wanting a Postscript printer your money would probably be better spent on a 68030 accelerator card.

But we started out talking about PageStream and what its printing capabilities are. Simply put, PageStream will produce output on virtually any printer at the highest resolution that printer is capable of producing. Leave the jaggies on the screen. The output

This is the PageStream Macro Editor. Commands may be entered directly using the script language or by using the menu keyboard equivalents.

Note the selections to edit the size of a bit-mapped graphic and to adjut the Screen Angle and Frequency for halftones.

Note that all these print options are available for ALL printers.

will be remarkably crisp. But we are all PageStream users already aren't we? We already know that. What I need to point out are a few of the special features that may have gone unnoticed.

Under the "Global" menu is an item called "Configure Printer". This is the place where you originally set up your printer as the default. One thing worth taking note of is the option of where to send the print output. If you need more than one copy of a page, it is usually faster to output the print file to hard disk rather than directly to the printer. You can then send that file to the printer as many times as needed. Be aware that these print files are large - be sure you have lots of disk space. One page will normally fit on a floppy, but just barely. (Of course, if you are using a floppy the speed gain will probably be negated anyway.) To print a file that has been "printed" to disk, go to the CLI and type TYPD &gt;PAR: ‹filename». Note that the file must be sent to PAR: and not to PRT:. Anything you send to PRT: is filtered through your Preferences printer driver which attempts to create printer control information. The print file created by PageStream already is in a format understood by your printer and doesn't need any further modification.

There is another use for the "Print to Disk" option if you happen to use an HP DeskJet as I do. In the club library and on the MCCC BBS is a program called FastJet. Fast/et is a program that you can set up to run in the background. Use the command RUN FASTJET PIPE:A and FastJet will wait in the background looking for a file called "A" to appear in the PIPE: device. Print your page (dr set of pages) to PIPE:, filename "A", and FastJet will take the raw printer data and convert it to the HP compressed format before sending it to the printer. Results will vary depending on the amount of data on the page but on a typical page (page 12 from the August MCCC News), the print time decreased from 1 minute and 18 seconds to just 58 seconds. Pages with less information on them are sped up even more. (Note that the effect with a standard DeskJet will be less dramatic than with a DeskJet Plus or DeskJet 500.)

Another thing that I need to cover is halftones. Halftone is a method used to simulate gray-scales when printing a bit-mapped graphic. If you select the "Edit Coordinates" item in the "Object" menu when you have a bit-map selected, you will see a couple of options that are used to control the halftone - look for "Screen Angle" and "Screen Frequency". By default both text gadgets will

## Thought for the Month

*****

The secret of sucess is sincerity

Once you can fake that, you have it made contain three dashes. This means that PageStream will select what it thinks are the best halftone options for your picture and your printer. But you can control those options here if you know what you're doing, and perhaps improve the output in the process. Before you can do that you need to know a little about halftones. Picture a four by four grid. Within that grid we have the option of coloring or leaving blank any of the individual sections. Since our grid is four by four we could leave them all white, we could fill in one section, two sections... or as many as all sixteen sections. This is the way a halftone works. If our printer can print 300 dpi and we want to have a four by four grid so that we can have the full sixteen gray shades that the Amiga is capable of, we will set our "Screen Frequency" to 75. The "Screen Frequency" is nothing more than a simulated resolution. If we set the frequency to 75, we will get an apparent resolution of 75 dpi - but within that 75 dpi we will have the capability of sixteen shades of gray because our printer is still really producing 300 dpi. Is it beginning to make a little sense? In other words, if our printer produces 300 dpi and we set the "Screen Frequency" to 60, we will have a five by five grid yielding 25 shades of gray. If we set frequeney to 150 we will have a 2 by 2 grid which gives us four shades of gray. A frequency of 300 will produce a pure black and white picture because we have just one section in our grid. (This is a setting that yields very legible screen-shots whenever shading is not important.) The things to remember are that the dpi of your printer must be an even multiple of your selected "Screen Frequency" and that the lower the "Screen Frequency" the lower the apparent resolution - but the greater the number of possible gray shades. It's a trade off. But by making an informed decision concerning resolution vs. number of colors you can sometimes improve the quality of your output. The other control, "Screen Angle" controls the pattern of the dots within the grid. Unless you are using a very low screen frequency relative to the printer resolution you are unlikely to notice any effect when this setting is changed.

I think that's it. The rest of the print functions are (I think) self evident or adequately covered in the documentation. As a matter of fact, I think that's it for the series. I hope that some of the things that I have covered have helped make a few things a little easier. Don't think that this is the end, however. Soft-Logik is currently advertising PageStream 2.2. Be on the lookout for a review here when it hits.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Garry Wordelman

Our August Meeting showed an improvement in attendance with about 40 members and visitors. If you were not one of them, than you missed an interesting presentation. Our ShareWare for the month is called "LZ" by LHAre Software and yes, it is the same archiving utility we had last month. Remember its primary use is to compress files for saving storage space or transferring smaller files through a modem. It's on library disk "SD TeleUtill". Support our Shareware of the Month.

The program presentation for the month was made by three representatives (Eddie Churchill, Tim Martin and Jim O'Flarrity) from INOVAtronics of Dallas. The first demo was of CanDo (version 1.5). CanDo is a program which can be used to create program-like code to perform a specific computer job. One example might be the creation of a chess playing program or game. Others might be to display an animation sequence with music for background or create a series color charts for a business presentation. To really get a feel of some of Can Do's capability, pick up Harold William's disk "HCB" (Harold's Coloring Book) from our library. It was available last month.

The second demo was of Directory Opus. This is a new-wave disk utility program used for file/directory control and can be configured for unique situations or specific user applications. It does many things such as showing pictures, playing sounds and anims, creating directory history and a full directory tree, has online help available and many other options. It looks like a great file utility to have.

Don't forget our next meeting in September because there is always something new and exciting about the Amiga.

## Amiga Central Harold Williams

The August meeting of the Amiga Central chapter featured a presentation by David Johnson of Ansoft (our new Fort Worth Amiga dealer). David demonstrated Digital Creations' DCTV. DCTV allows the Amiga to work with incredibly beautiful NTSC color pictures on a composite monitor. The paint package that comes with DCTV is remarkable. This was quite a show.

This month on the 19th, we will have a presentation by INOVAtronics. INOVAtronics is the company that brought us Cape68K and CanDo, but they also handle many other products. We will be seeing Directory Opus, their new directory utility. INOVAtronics has also just released a new product named Design Works that includes a huge number of icon style buttons for nearly every possible type of application. There are rumors that INOVAtronics may be moving into hardware. This will be our chance to get some first hand information.

Next month (October) we are going to meet on an odd schedule. Our meeting will be held on October 24th, the fourth Thursday. This is a one time change. We will be back on our usual third Thursday schedule in November. The October meeting will be worth the wait. David Johnson is returning. This time he will be showing us Surface Master and Map Master for Imagine.

METCOM 91 is almost here (there should be tons of information elsewhere in this newsletter). One of METCOM's activities is the MCCC Flea Market. If you have software or hardware that you would like to place in the flea market you must make arrangements in advance. The easiest way to deliver your things to the flea market committee is to bring them to the September meeting.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Well, here we go again with another school year beginning, METCOM 91 on the horizon, and the Christmas season around the corner! Seems our turnout is growing every month... must be doing something right! As I looked around me this month, I saw ties and T-shirts, techs and rookies, "moms" and "pros". We all come together to celebrate and share a common interest. Ain't it great?

Here's an interesting dilemma: first we have rumors, then we have questions. What if you have a question about a rumor - where does it fit in? Wherever! That's how we help each other and expand our shared knowledge. News: Brett Hester is starting a Toaster SIG (Special Interest Group) and is polling interested people about meeting topics and times best for all. Contact him at 233-5483 if you're one of them. He's also running a gaming competition at METCOM 91 - needs machines, programs, ideas, players, suggestions. Call him!

Our shareware pick for August was again the fine compression program LZ. If you use and enjoy shareware products, donate at the meetings!

David Marshall of Metropolitan presented a brief overview of word processors for the Amiga. He spotlighted excellence! as an example of the best among the group which includes ProWrite, QuickWrite, Pen Pal, and Word Perfect (ranging from $60-$200). A problem he discussed involved printer drivers and fonts and difficulties with producing professional-looking output. (Want desktop publishing? Get PageStream. These are only SUPPOSED to be word-processors.) He suggested when printing draft copies, etc., create the text with the standard font "TOPAZ 11". , as its size

## CHAPTER NEWS

and spacing is closest to the printer's built-in font and will produce screen images closest to the printed output. Many word processors print out the whole image graphically, but excellence! and Pen Pal can shift modes and actually combine graphics (pictures embedded in the text) with text using the printer's built-in font to get the best looking output. Most word processors have spelling checkers (some can check as you type, slow but effective), and a thesaurus on-line to help you find that elusive word. excellence! has a grammar checker, too, that even has "levels of pickyness" so you can determine how "polished" you want your final product. It would never put up with a sentence beginning with a lower-case letter, for example! Would the gentleman who suggested I run my articles through this grammarianiguardian care to buy me a copy, or would he prefer to get elected at gunpoint to Secretary next election? (heh, heh!) I'd be interested to see my creative efforts compared to the Gettysburg Address, or a life insurance policy, or assigned a grade level readability. (Or would I? Might be depressing!) As for structuring your document, you can set margins, center paragraphs, justify, etc., and cut and paste info from elsewhere in this document or even other files. Standard IFF pictures and brushes can be plugged in and text guided around them. There is no way to draw pretty boxes and tables, unless the whole image is created in, say, DPAINT III and loaded as graphics. Other features: page preview (full image of 2 pages condensed on screen), mail merge, table of contents, glossary, page numbering, etc. The demo was done on floppies only, slow but functional, and only 1 meg is required (virtual memory allows larger documents). This package was $299 retail but is now selling for a reasonable $160. It was very interesting to have comments from the "peanut gallery"

on how other packages handled various situations: again, our shared experience enriches us all. Thanks, David!

Next we had visits with representatives of our TWO Dallas dealers, Metropolitan and The Edge. We really are lucky to have both of them for support, supply AND competition (keep it friendly, guys!) Jim Dent from The Edge announced an all-day celebration at the store on the day of the Star Trek: Next Generation season premier, 9/28. Their BBS is up and running on 2 lines at 960-7017. Comments on the store and its services are invited! The Edge is greatly expanding their hardware line, and getting in more European titles. Check out the sale on educational software - don't forget we MCCC members get 10% off on software!

Then we welcomed home Sonia King, now leader of the NEW Metropolitan Amiga team, formerly from the late lamented Amazing Computers. Sonia shook off most of the moving dust and came to invite us to the Grand "Re-Opening" of the new location. After unpacking boxes all day, she had a GOOD idea just how much "stuff" will be on the shelves for us to explore. Some of it they'll be GIVING away (like old Amazing mouse pads!) at their celebration on 9/28 (uh huh, same Saturday). Some Commodore reps will be on hand to answer questions. The "new" Metropolitan will combine the experience and stability of the oldest Amiga dealer in Dallas with the friendly, accessible and wellstocked style Amazing was famous

## HEB Robyn Wilson

At the October meeting, four word processors were discussed. They were Paperclip 2, Fontmaster 2 (both 64 and 128 version) and Speedscript. All these word processors were very interesting to listen and learn about. Each one has its own characteristics.

It's time for METCOM 91! It will be held on October 5th at the Arlington Convention Center. This is a "get-together" of all Commodore computer users. Us C64 and C128 people need to make a good showing so the Amiga people will not dominate the convention. Several people are going to be there at a Help Desk (including me) to help you with any questions about programs you may want to purchase or those you were just wondering about. There will be several different program demos discussed as well.

The time for nominating a slate of officers is here. We need to be ready to discuss and set up a list of candidates for next year's officers at November's meeting.
