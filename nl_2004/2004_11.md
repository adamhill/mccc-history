## Moving Forward

It's been another month. The Amiga One moves forward with a new smaller board on the way, along with OS4 still in progress. The Pegasos does much the same, as its users snap up info about high-profile applications of Pegasos hardware (using Linux for the most part) and specs for the slowly upcoming MorphOS 1.5. There's a lot of tension between the two camps, hoping for the success of their own, possibly praying for the downfall of the other. Both systems are more like than unlike, and that may well be the problem. As unlikely as it might be, I'd like to see both options become successful, as it makes for better computing in general. I predict that most worthwhile new software will be made available for both systems, unless one pulls far ahead in marketshare.

As I've mentioned multiple times before, I've had a Pegasos 2 system since slightly before the first of the year. Except for a quirk here and there, it performs admirably, though I know it is not doing all it should as yet. Part of the reason for this is a lack of software. Some pieces of software I use commonly on my Amiga 4000T cannot be used practically on the Pegasos, and there is not yet a suitable replacement. I have definitely tasted its power however. While usable on the Amiga, graphic software such as FXPaint, Photogenics and Image FX really come into their own with the CPU horsepower of the Pegasos, even though some software is not running natively on the PPC, but emulated through the JIT compiler. Another thing the Pegasos has done for me is become a center for media playback and emulation in a way my A4000 never could, not without a hefty upgrade anyway.

My Amiga has a 50 Mhz 68060, a 200 Mhz PPC, and a Cybervision 64 Video card. A 1 Ghz G4 PPC and a Radeon card beat that down easily. Add on top some MorphOS-centric software such as M player (a port of a Linux media player) and AmiNetRadio, and the Pegasos becomes quite good at handling all media formats the Amiga can, if not more, and taking on higher resolutions and bitrates with ease. The other hobby I've taken on with the Pegasos is emulation of other systems. This is doable on the Amiga as well, but the Pegasos horsepower and MorphOS ports really make it a worthwhile thing. I routinely emulate arcade machines with MAME, an Atari 2600 with Stella, a Commodore 64 with Frodo, and an Amiga with UAE. Actually the Amiga emulation is not very useful right now, as it seems to run too fast and/or choppy to be practical. Hopefully that is more of a software issue, and will be helped with some updates. I plan to demonstrate some (or all) of my emulation options at the November meeting.

## Not Much News

I have to admit that, in recent months, I rarely go to any of the Amiga related web sites looking for news. It seems that real news items are few and far between. However, as I  started writing this article, I suddenly realized I didn't have anything to write about. I decided I'd better do some research. I took a look at some of the Amiga sites to see if there was any startling news that would be worth headlines. The answer was no.

Actually, the first site I went to was Amiga.com. I forgot that was the company site, I had intended to go to Amiga.org. Anyway, on Amiga.com, when I looked at the news, the last entry was in August - 2003. Then I checked Amiga.org and ANN.lu. There was a lot of stuff on the site, but after sifting through it, at least for me, there was not much of interest, mostly a couple new games.

When Bryant Pedigo, from Indianapolis, brought his Amiga One over to display in our booth at Computerfest®, everyone became aware that there were a lot of functions that were not operational yet in OS-4. The word had been circulated that the production version would be released by the end of August. It was obvious at Computerfest® that it hadn't happened. As near as I could find, no new release date has been announced. There is, however, an update for the development beta versions of OS-4 that appear to address a number of the shortcomings. Some of the improvements include improved computation and speed of the 68k emulation and USB support for inputs. They have also attempted to improve a number of the drivers including those involved with internet access, ethernet support, printing support and support of some hardware systems. They have also done a number of bug fixes, mentioned improvement in the PPC function and added a Picasso 96 graphics system, although I don't fully understand that last item. The main thing is that Hyperion does appear to be actively addressing many of the items that we had perceived as shortcomings in what we had seen at Computerfest®.

I did also see a notice of an Amiga Show in Ottawa, Canada on November 20. Those of you who like to

## Editor's Comments

Thanks goodness for the AmiTech-Dayton Gazette. Without it I'd have nothing at all to print.

The annual flea market is once again history. I think we set a record for low attendance this year. If you missed it - and I'm pretty sure you did - you missed an opportunity for some really good bargains.

By this time everyone is probably fed up with elections - and you probably thought you were donefor awhile. Sorry. Elections for club officers will take place at this month's chapter meetings. The slate of officers is unchanged from last year, and all positions are running un-opposed.

| President               | Bill Raecke     |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Vice President          | Ned Kelly       |
| Treasurer               | Johnny Kitchens |
| Secretary               | Wayne Brodnax   |
| Educational Coordinator | David Owens     |

Nominations for chapter officers will occur at this month's meetings and be voted on in December.
