## Amiga News?

I have been constantly perusing several of the Amiga web sites looking for any news of interest and after several attempts,  all I can say is

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

The only things I have seen of interest over the last few days was announcement of a new program for the Amiga called Hollywood Designer. It is an editor to generate presentations, games for Multimedia Application Layer Hollywood, whatever that is. A new 256 color Icon set has bee announced for OS4. Woopee.

Probably the most interesting thing announced recently is the limited availability of preproduction versions of the Amiga One mini ATX boards. One of the things that many of us have longed for and never had is an Amiga Laptop and the mini boards may provide the potential for this to happen. Of course the major problem with that is the continuing unavailability of OS-4, a major element in obtaining any new generation Amiga, laptop or desktop.

The Pegasos/Morph OS system appears to be more promising at this point, if for no other reason than the fact that there is a central organization responsible for the development and marketing the system and the complete system is available. On the Amiga side, as long as Amiga, Inc. is in limbo there will be no concentrated marketing effort, unless Eyetech and Hyperion can get together and establish an integrated development and marketing program.

For now all we can is cross our fingers and hope that both, but at least one of these systems becomes adequately accepted to generate a user base sufficient support the system, which can result in further development to insure that the resulting systems will be developed adequately to become leading edge state of the art systems. So keep those fingers crossed.

## Cloanto News

6 January, 2004 Amiga Inc. and Cloanto are delighted to announce that Personal Paint 7.1 will be available on the upcoming AmigaOS 4.0 operating system.

The Personal Paint series of 2D graphics and animations applications has been a mainstay of the application base for the Amiga platform ever since its introduction in 1992 and it is also a star attraction of the Cloanto Amiga Forever package.

As Cloanto considers a new version of the product for AmigaOS 4.0, it has decided to show its commitment to the Amiga platform and community by making the source code of the current version available to Amiga Inc., allowing them to create a PowerPC native version for the upcoming AmigaOS 4.0

product. The created binaries will be owned by Cloanto but will be made available for free download from the Amiga and Cloanto web sites.

Cloanto and Amiga are also in talks concerning a new version of Amiga Forever, as well as a special version of Amiga Forever for AmigaOS 4.0, which aims to provide chipset-level Classic Amiga compatibility integrated with the new generation Amiga operating system and hardware.

## Internet BBS's

A while back I dropped in to mention the TelBBS site. (Hooking 8bit machines to the Internet for the purpose of running BBSes over the Internet.) A couple people here responded, so I thought I'd pass on that http://www.petscii.com now has a support forum for people working on these setups.

While my own interests are in CBM based systems, we are NOT machine specific. Both software and interface designers are on hand to answer questions for anyone needing help.

If you haven't heard about this, I welcome you to drop into the website and join in some 80's style BBS fun. http://www.petscii.com
