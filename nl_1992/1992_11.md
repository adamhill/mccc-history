## METCOM

another one bytes the dust by David Owens

A nother METCOM has come and gone and what are we left with? A lot of fun, fond memories and, · if you're like me, an empty wallet. If you didn't make it to METCOM, you really missed a fun day. Everyone was kept running all day long. We had approximately 350 people come through the doors to attend the classes, presentations, flea-market or the dealer and developer area. We were happy about the attendance but we would always like to see more. Maybe next year.

First off I want to thank the Arlington Convention Center for a great location and for helping us year after year put on a great METCOM. They have a great staff and were always wanting to help. Thanks ACC.

I also want to thank all of the Dealers and Developers that attended. Metropolitan and Ansoft have always helped support the efforts of our club and they didn't let us down at the show this year either. Ansoft and Metropolitan had their tables filled at the beginning of the day. Luckily, they were not so full at the end of the day. Thanks for your support of our club. We had a new developer show up at METCOM almost at the last minute. NeuraLink was a great addition to the show this year. They didn't find out about the show until Thursday, called and arranged to have a table and came to METCOM. They have developed "The Context Bible" for the Amiga and came all the way from Lubbock Saturday morning just to be there. That's what I call real dedication! All of the dealers/developers had people at their tables all day. Let's continue to support our local dealers and developers so we will continue to have great software for our computers and places to go to purchase these products.

We also had booths for SCOPE, the VidSig, our library, the registration table for new/renewal memberships and, of course, the flea market. The librarians were kept busy all day selling disks out of the library. Our librarians work very hard providing access to thousands of pd software we keep in our library. They are always at the chapter meetings with the last year's worth of disks making copies or selling pre-made disks. Be sure to check with them every month to see what is new in the library. They usually have at least 10 new disks per month. The special membership offer always seems to be a big success and it wasn't any different this year. We had 21 new members sign up and over 40 renewals. This was great. Let's get the word out what we can do to promote the Amiga as the super machine that it is. We want to welcome all our new members and remind you that we are here to help you...so if you have any questions, give one of the officers a call and we will try to help you with your problems.

The flea market was one of the best we have ever had. Hardware and software for the Amiga and C64/C128 machines were abundant. And people were busy buying all day long. Just about anything you could think of was there. If you missed it, plan to be at next year's METCOM. For anyone who had sold something in the flea market, you should receive your money soon. If anything didn't sell in the flea market, contact your dropoff point and arrange to pick up your stuff as soon as possible. Thanks to Pete Goad, Ray Howard, Doug Gaudin, Harold Williams and Eddie Corr for making the flea market such a HUGE success.

For some reason everybody got really excited about three times that Saturday. I think it might have had something to do with the door prizes. We had large crowds present every time we had the drawings...and for good reason. Our local and not-so-local dealers and developers were very generous this year when asked to donate. Look elsewhere in this newsletter for a detailed list of the door prizes — but I'd like to give special thanks to those who contributed here. Ansoft, GVP, INOVAtronics, Merit, Metropolitan, Neurolink, New Horizons and Soft Logik. Special thanks to Johnny Kitchens and others for rounding up these great door prizes. → Page 4

As far as I know the presentations went off with hardly any problems. Our own club member, Kerry Batts, gave a demo on a package he developed for Merit software, Tom Laundry Football. He showed how it can be played by one or two people locally or through a serial port hookup. I think this means you can play via modem also. Metropolitan presented a software package called Info Channel. This is like those computer controlled directories in the malls — and cable TV stations use it to have events happen at controlled intervals. This showed off a professional business package that is putting the Amiga in the business world. Ansoft then demonstrated ASDG's newest graphics package, Morph Plus. Morphing is used to turn one object into another. Take for example the legend of the werewolf. Every full moon the normal, emotionally stable person morphs or metamorphs into a hairy dog that walks on two legs. That is not what Ansoft showed, but they did show what Morph Plus does and some tricks on how to do it. The last presentation of the day was by INOVAtronics. Eddie Churchill talked about CanDo 2.0, Directory OPUS, and GigaMem, three of their products. He even answered some questions about the 4000. We want to thank Ansoft, INOVAtronics, Metropolitan and Merit for providing professional presentations for our show.

The classes were a success in their own right.

The ARexx Class had the largest attendance with 21 people wanting to understand more about this language and how to offered. The people attending the classes seemed to enjoy the classes and actually wanted more. Specia thanks to Harold Williams and the teachers of the classes. Just a note - Harold has been nominated for the position of the Educational Coordinator. If elected, he plans to hold classes like this throughout out the next year. Be looking forward to that.

Well, that was what METCOM was like. I know I enjoyed it and I think that everyone that attended did too. If you didn't attend, make plans to come next year. Satisfaction guaranteed or double your admission price back. A few other things to mention. Thanks to Judy, Edna and Joanna for running the registration table. Thanks to John Malmstrom and Okley Moss for taking care of the membership table and to Gary Campbell and his son for handling the club library. And thanks for all of those I have forgotten that helped make METCOM the success it was this year. Having said all of that...I'm outa here. J

## = Accelerating the A500

## Microbotics VXL-30

By Glenn Pettry of the Tampa Bay Amiga Group s a computer hobbyist, I've been playing with various computer systems for the last twenty or so · years, doing nearly everything one could do with them. With the Amiga 500, I've been extremely happy (but oh!, what I'd do for a Cray!). But, its relative lack of expandability is a minor problem; some applications take FOREVER on it, notably raytracing and DTP. Getting an A2000 was an option, but this was not financially likely in the near future. What to do?

The answer came in the form of the VXL-30 from Microbotics, Inc. The VXL-30 is an accelerator for the A500, which plugs directly into the socket intended for the 68000 microprocessor on the motherboard, which is then mounted on the VXL. (Note: the unit will also work on the A2000.) The board itself holds a 68030 processor, running at 25 MHz, as well as having a 68882 FPU. (That's Floating Point Unit, for the uninitiated. It speeds up certain math operations.) No memory is included on the board itself, although Microbotics promises to release one Real Soon Now, which will plug onto an expansion bus on one edge. Otherwise, the unit is very, similar to other accelerator boards.

Installing the VXL-30 is fairly easy, but is probably better left to a trained technician, especially if your unit is still under warranty. But if you are so inclined, you can install it yourself; mine came without instructions, but wasn't particularly difficult to install without them. The most difficult part of the installation was getting the thing to work properly, and THAT turned out to be software related: one of the programs in my startup-sequence hung up the system, while running under the '030. Oh, well, I guess I can live with the drives clicking...

The VXL comes with setup software to allow configuring it to run either the 68000 or the 68030 on demand. This is pretty much de rigueur these days, as some software doesn't like to run accelerated, or is best left unaccelerated. With a little trial and error, one can speed up the operation of most software by running either SetCPU or SetVXL, and setting the instruction and data caches on. (These caches are storage areas for either instructions or data, allowing the system to "preload" information which the processor will need in the immediate future.) At this point, my startup-sequence, which is fairly extensive, runs through in about 2 minutes, where it generally took about seven or eight under the 68000.

provided by the '030 and the FPU, I can do more complex things than before. (I still need to get the 32-bit wide memory board to fully accelerate the system, but the situation has improved.) I can even multitask while rendering; this is being written while Imagine is working, without seriously bogging down the system.

Other programs do well when accelerated, as well;

Without acceleration, with Imagine, even relatively simple scenes took hours to do. With the acceleration provided by the '030 and the FPU, I can do more complex things...and can even multitask while rendering.

archiving and unarchiving files takes less time, loading and processing files is quicker, etc. I noticed, while preparing the last newsletter, significant improvements when dealing with the complex page files which I usually create, as well as a general speedup when displaying text. Overall, the system as it is now is much more productive. Some games, on the other hand, may not like this particular accelerator; I have noticed some strange crashes when running Black Crypt, for instance. But, for them, the 68000 is still available, just a double-click away.

To end this review, I would say this: The MicroBotics VXL-30 is an excellent way to upgrade the A500 to the "BIG GUY" level of system. SysInfo (a system information program) didn't think much of a stock A500 (YAWN!), but now I get a different message (LET'S GO, DUDE!). It may not be a significant improvement, by comparison with some of the systems I have seen lately, but any improvement that allows for more productivity is good. And, once MicroBotics gets around to it, with 32 bit

The best advantage, for me at least, is the FPU; I can now use the floating point versions of some of the higher end graphics packages. This has enabled me to actually attempt to do fully raytraced images, under Imagine, at home. Without acceleration, even relatively simple scenes took hours to do; with the acceleration

(One final note: After the above was written, I learned that some company has released an '040 plug-in for the A500!! I have no data as yet, but will be looking into this...)

## HotLinks Editions

version 1.1 has some improvements and one major new feature by Bill Raecke otLinks Editions is a relatively new product from Soft Logik, the makers of PageStream. It contains three separate software packages at a modest price — HotLinks, PageLiner, and BME. This new release contains some improvements and one major new capability, and has been updated to use the new AmigaOS 3.0 menu styles and gadgetry when run under 3.0.

necessary to enter two numbers in the size selection box separated by a comma — a procedure that works well but is less than obvious). Soft Logik may have just given us a peek at the upgrade to PageStream.

Another big improvement to PageLiner is the addition of a color selection requester that allows you to set the colors of the user interface. Let me be a little

This is PageLiner's new font requester. Note the separate selections for Size and Width.

![Image](1992_11_artifacts/image_000004_ffc7d5ebf308d004d5577ed8066d5a9daf9236ff81cdae9719df9309415c2930.png)

HotLinks is the product that allows text and bitmapped pictures to be shared between applications in such a way that if one program modifies the document, it is automatically changed in the other. So far, HotLinks capable programs include PageStream, PageLiner, BME, ProWrite 03.3, and ImageMaster. Others are sure to follow. This version of HotLinks (v1.1) has been only slightly modified — at least so far as can be seen. The user interface has been greatly improved so that the requesters are less busy and more easily understood. I have a hunch there were a lot more changes that took place but they are not visible. Of course, HotLinks is a program that is that works in the background anyway with little human intervention...so it stands to reason that there would be little in the way of visible changes.

PageLiner has undergone some modest improvements. PageLiner is a "text processor" designed specifically to serve as a companion to PageStream. It is the program I now use exclusively when preparing text to go into the newsletter. In this update, it is now possible to set fonts (including the typeface, style and size) using a requester similar to that found in Pagestream. In fact, the requester is somewhat improved over what is found in PageStream — because now there are separate selectors for the height and width of fonts (in PageStream it is clearer about this. You cannot change colors with this requester — you can only specify which of the available colors should be used as background, text, etc. This is perfectly reasonable since in most cases you will be running PageLiner on the Workbench or the PageStream screen. You would want those applications to control the colors themselves.

Also new is the addition of a full range of settings menus. These allow you to set window size, data paths, function keys — most of the settings that used to be controlled by "tool types" in the PageLiner icon. In fact, the only settings I don't see controllable by menus and requesters are the option to specify a public screen and the option to specify a display font. This makes configuring PageLiner to your liking much easier than it was before.

BME is where the big changes have taken place. BME (Bit Map Editor) is a program designed to allow you to edit bit-mapped pictures. It is unique in that it is the only product I am aware of that allows you to edit pictures of up to 32 bit-planes (over FOUR BILLION colors) on a standard Amiga (displaying only 4,096 colors). New in this revision is the ability to edit a TIFF file (in addition to GIF and IFF ILBM), the ability to specify a font to use in the interface, and an improved brush color requester. But

the big news is the new autotrace capability. Autotrace is a function that takes a bitmap and, using edge detection Logic, converts the picture into a structured drawing. (For the uninitiated, a bitmap is a drawing that is described to the computer as a series of dots or pixels. When used in a desktop publishing program, such pictures tend to look blocky due to the high resolution of the printer when compared to a computer monitor. The problem gets worse if the picture needs to be expanded. Structured drawings, on the other hand, are described to the computer as a set of lines, curves and fills. This means that they will look as good at any resolution — computer screen or printer - and are not affected adversely by enlargement.)

Until now, the only product offering an autotrace capability was the program simple called Trace that was distributed with Professional Draw. BME is a huge improvement over that product. In what way, you ask? First, how about the fact that there is a real user interface. You get to see the picture you are about to trace, you get to choose the area of the picture to trace, and you see the trace as it progresses. That's right, you see the lines as they are drawn around objects (and you can abort it if things aren't progressing the way you expected). Trace gives you two controls — you can control the "fit" and you can specify whether you want fills or just lines. With BME, you can specify the Sample Rate, the Curve Fit and the Noise Filter level (which filters out unnecessary information which may have been picked up by a scanned-in image). As with Trace, BME allows you to specify whether you want fills or not — but you may additionally specify whether to save "strokes" (lines). (Without lines you will get only fill patterns.) You may also specify a color autotrace (where the original colors of the bitmap are retained) or just a black and white trace — and you can specify whether you want to trace the background color or not. Finally, BME lets you control your output by allowing you to specify that you want only straight lines, only bézier curves, or lines and curves. BME saves its output in a standard IFF DR2D format (another improvement from the idiosyncratic ProDraw files) that can be edited in PageStream or in the soon-tobe-released Art Expression from Soft Logik.

HotLinks Editions has always been a bargain. Three software products for the price of one — and a reasonable price at that. This new upgrade makes it even more of a bargain than it was before.

This is the BME requester that controls the autotrace function. Note the Fill, Stroke and Color Selections.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

A migoids by Mare Lafontaine This is a good month for game players (and · we all play games once in a while whether we like to admit it or not, don't we?). The first is Amigoids on club disk MCCC-A\_441. This is an Asteroids clone. The premise, in case you aren't familiar with it, is simple enough. You control a spaceship that is flying though an asteroid storm. Your job is to destroy the asteroids with your blaster while avoiding any collisions which will destroy you. The game is simple in concept — and the execution is excellent, with nice graphics and sound. And there is an option that allows you to use any objects you choose as the spaceship and asteroids. Several alternates are included on the disk...and, of course, you can design your own if you are so inclined.

## Klondike by Gaylan Wallis

Care for a nice game of solitaire? This is version 1.9 of what is perhaps the best version of solitaire available. Best because it is configurable. You choose the screen colors and you choose the rules. You can disable the normal Hoyle rules if you prefer. There are sudden-death modes that end the game if you miss a move...and there is a mode that will tell you if a move is possible. A few sound effects would be a welcome addition but this is a nice game nonetheless. Besides, if the game had sound effects it might interfere with the music that I like to play in the background. You'll find Klondike on MCCC-A\_444.

## PacMan by Edgar M. Vigdal

I know...another PacMan clone. But this one's nice. There are 20 levels, 5 bonus levels, and it all works beautifully. There are some problems with graphics on my machine unless I turn off the accelerator, but if you have a 68000 based machine it should run like a charm. It's on MCCC-A\_146.

## CrossDOS 5.04 Patch from Consultron

If you are an owner of CrossDOS 5.0, you'll want to get the upgrade on disk MCCC-A\_442. This will take you to version 5.04. There are no major new features but this fixes a few bugs that were present in the earlier versions.

## PageStream 2.21 Patch from Soft Logik

Another patch. This one, from Soft Logik, updates PageStream from version 2.2HL to 2.21. Nothing major here - just the addition of a new menu item to break a (HotLinks) link and a bug fix that keeps text formatted properly when you edit a text block. And it now uses Workbench 3.0 styles when run on a 3.0 equipped computer. It's on MCCC-A\_147.

## Postscript Fonts

As seems to be the case most months, we have a large selection of Postscript fonts to choose from. There are nineteen new fonts on MCCC-A 441 and another fourteen on MCCC-A\_451.

## SIOTTHDU BUSTLE

Egbert

![Image](1992_11_artifacts/image_000006_92c68a22f61839af554e438c1bd58eb8b9855a8dd138cda993787e5a1a0e4a11.png)

Blocky

For those with ARexx installed on their system (and remember, if you have AmigaOS 2.0 or 3.0 you have ARexx), there are two interesting ARexx programs on MCCC-A\_443. The first is Loan.rexx by Ron Timblin. Supply this program with a loan amount, an interest rate, and a length of your loan and this program will calculate the monthly payment and will then produce a monthly amortization schedule for you. You may output the results to the screen or to the printer.

## ARexx Programs

The second program is NIST\_Timeset.rexx by J. L. Moulton. This is a program that calls the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado, and automatically sets the system clock and the hardware clock for you. I have found one bug. It doesn't know what to do with a busy signal...but since this is ARexx, you can fix this yourself. Any takers?

## Music

On MCCC-A 444 you'll find a beautiful version of the Allegro from Bach's Brandenburg Concerto #5 coded by Ed Ritchie. This is a nice change from the endless and often mindless stream of "original" compositions we see so much of in the Tracker and MED formats. This piece is in the MED format and comes with its own player. For some reason, the other players seem unable to recognize this format. In any case, it's well worth adding to your collection. The doc file that comes with it indicates that there is a two disk set of similar music that runs for 1 hour and 18 minutes available from Ed Ritchie for $20. It

may be worth ordering even though $20 at first glance seems a bit steep.

## ToolManager 2.0 by Stephan Becker

ToolManager is the package that allows you to add items to your Tools menu under Workbench 2.0. This is an improved version that allows more flexibility than the earlier version and a few new features. Actually, you can do more than just add items to the Tools menu. You can also set up hotkeys to run applications or you can set up "App Icons" ("App Icons" appear on your Workbench and when double-clicked run the application no matter where the application resides. You can also "drop" a project icon on an "App Icon" to automatically run the application using that project as the file to open with. It works great for picture viewers [Mostra] or text readers [MuchMore or PPMore] or text editors [TurboText].) You can also use ToolManager to set up one or two "Docks". A dock is a concept that works much like an "App Icon" except that the icons appear in a narrow window that runs vertically or that runs vertical, or horizontally across the Workbench. Unlike a normal Amiga window, the icons displayed in the dock window do not have to reside in the same location on the disk.

ToolManager 2.0 is too big to reside on a single disk and the author does not allow breaking up the archive. That means that I have had to place it on the club disk in archived format. You will need a hard drive or plenty of memory to extract the archive since it un-packs to about 1.5 meg. My apologies. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_ 445.

## ARQ by Martin Laubach

You've probably been using ARQ for quite some time now. If not, I must assume you have just recently

FR Bypass

![Image](1992_11_artifacts/image_000007_9ea7aa44df3322122a0e394ac829a0344077073cd5bbb38a569952ce9354cb92.png)

purchased your Amiga and haven't gotten everything you need yet. ARQ is a small commodity that runs in the background and replaces all those standard, boring requesters with nifty animated requesters - ones that look the way Amiga requesters should look. For example, the delete requester — the one that says "Warning - You cannot get back what you delete" - displays a picture of a rotating Earth in space that explodes and disappears. ARQ runs under Workbench 1.3 or 2.0 so there's no excuse for not using it. The update contains only minor modifications. It's on MCCC-A\_448.

## File Requesters

There are three replacements for the standard Workbench 2.0 ASL File Requester in this month's library. Now, there's nothing really wrong with the ASL requester except that it is SLOW. It seems to take forever to call up a directory list. All three of the replacements are significantly faster and they all provide extra features and look better to boot. I'm not going to take the time to explain each of them in detail here. Ill just tell you that they are there. You owe it to yourself to check them out and decide for yourself which is best for you. ReqChange by Magnus is on MCCC-A\_448. It is released as Freeware and is fully functional. ER Bypass version 4.01 by Khalid Aldoseri is released as Shareware. Some features are disabled in this version...but even this version works much better than ASL. You can find it on MCCC-A\_450. MFR (Magic File Requester) version 2.0e by Stefan Stuntz is also released as Shareware. Like FR Bypass, some features are disabled - mostly the ability to save default settings — but, also like FR Bypass, what is there works better than ASL. It's on MCCC-A\_451.

## Secretary's Report

from the Halloween BOD meeting by John Malmstrom

Dord me were gone ang wit that fate. avid Owens really looked different at the MCCC frown lines were gone, along with that frantic, worried look in his eyes. All were replaced by a big grin with a slight hint of self satisfaction. And we all know why, too. David did a fantastic job organizing our very successful METCOM 92. Of course David was quick to point out that the success of any such effort is seldom due to one individual and thanked everyone who worked visibly and behind the scenes to make METCOM 92 what it was. To that, I'd like to add a personal thanks to Judy Williams, Joanna Owens, and Edna Malmstrom for their usual long day's work at the registration tables. We were pretty busy at the membership booth, too. Thanks to Okley Moss for helping there, 21 new MCCC members took advantage of our 13/12 offer and 62 current members extended their memberships. These figures are much higher than in recent years, so maybe our membership is on the way up again. Here's where we stand (by chapter) as of November 1, 1992:

| Amiga by the Loop       |   54 |
|-------------------------|------|
| Amiga Central           |   72 |
| Amiga North Dallas      |   98 |
| Amiga West              |   45 |

## Final Copy 1.2

a personal word processor with style by Ed Berger, Pittsburgh Commodore User Group inal Copy is a fairly new word processor by based on the WYSIWYG paradigm. Unlike previous word processors available for the Amiga, Final Copy uses outline fonts. This means it prints text to your printer in graphics format, at the highest resolution you have selected. Final Copy allows you to include IFF pictures in a document, resizing them as you wish. It is similar to Pagestream, or Professional Page in this regard. It is different in that it uses Nimbus Q type fonts, instead of Postscript, or Compugraphic fonts. It comes with fonts equivalent to what is normally found in a Postscript printer, so there is a variety. Final Copy also can output Postscript to a printer or file.

I was looking for an easy way to take a basic ASCII file, like the documentation to a PD program, and be able to quickly produce a nice readable copy. Final Copy excels in this area. Unlike ProPage 2.1, which I had been using, Final Copy takes less RAM, and less work to get the results I want.

Let me explain... With ProPage, I would have to start the program, go to the "page setup" and guess the number of pages the file would take, import the text and then work on it, adding pages if I had guessed wrongly. To manipulate the text, I would have to go back and forth, to the page gadget, and select the page I was working on, since I couldn't just scroll down to the next page like I can with Final Copy. The sluggishness of ProPage in my system (practically running out of RAM) made the process tedious. Final Copy seems more responsive for this simple type of work, though it is no match for ProPage when the job at hand is more complex, like assembling this newsletter.

One nice feature of Final Copy is the special gadgets in the page ruler. These allow you to quickchange the justification, line spacing, or hyphenation of a block, without having to figure out what menu the option is in. You can just mark a block of text by "painting" it with the mouse, and then select the gadget to make the change. Final Copy has one of the nicest looking user interfaces of any Amiga program I have seen — if you use interlaced mode. Final Copy comes with a spell checker, and a dictionary/thesaurus, like the more expensive word processors, so you can check your document, or look up a word. It can import and manipulate IFF pictures, but not structured drawings, for inclusion in your documents. It offers multiple columns, selectably editable headers and footers, so you could make a basic newsletter type layout. It offers some ARexx support, though I haven't found any available ARexx programs that make use of this to add more features.

Final Copy offers a lot for the home user. It would need to add some more features before I could recommend it for serious business users, looking for a replacement to Word Perfect, or other "professional" word processors. For $99.95 list price, $59.00 discounted, I think it is well worth it.

This is Final Copy at work

who now is working for MicroBotics on their VXL-30 accelerator for the A500 (although Darren did say that A2000 owners could fit it in as well).

October was a busy month for our president, David Owens, since he is VP of the MCCC he has to organize and arrange METCOM and as president of the Loop Chapter he handles our meetings.

The usual welcome complete, David brought us up to date regarding the release of Commodore's new A4000 machine featuring the AGA (Advanced Graphic Architecture) chipset and a Motorola 68040. More on this later.

The first order of business was METCOM. David urged everybody to attend and sign up for the different classes. The various other areas that are ever present at our annual show were discussed. People that had items for the Flea Market were encouraged to get those items to the organizers. However, by the time you read this METCOM will be finished and it will have been excellent!!!!

Makes me drool over my keyboard thinking about that. Ah well!!

Now, as I mentioned earlier, the A4000 machine. Scott Lamb very kindly brought us up to date with the new technology for this machine. He ran through the technical data for the AGA chipset including the fact that it now supports 8 bit-planes, with a phenomenal color palette. The processing speed is breathtaking with the MC68040 chip running at 25MHz. The only drawback that Scott found was the use of the dreaded "IDE" Hard disk drive, rather than the more usual "SCSI" drive that we have grown to love for its speed. Apart from that, and Scott did tell us that Commodore is working on a "SCSI-2" interface board for the A4000, he said that the machine he has is AWESOME!!

The presentation for this month was given by Darren Arrick,

Commodore released the Amiga 4000 and the MCCC Central chapter was one of the first anywhere to see one. Scott Lamb presented the machine and a few of its new capabilities. The Amiga 4000 is a leap ahead for the Amiga line. Just a few of the facts about the 4000 are 25,000 colors out of a palette of 16.8 million, a 24-bit capable video slot, and AmigaDOS 3.0. The new graphic chipset supports 60 frame/sec full screen double-buffered animation in 256,000 colors and one can have a 256 color WorkBench screen. The main processor is a 68040/25MHz on a daughter board that can be replaced with faster processors as they become available. The 4000 can have 18 MB of RAM on the motherboard and can address up to 1.7 GB of RAM via the expansion slots. A 1.78 MB floppy drive is included along with a 120 MB hard drive. CrossDOS has been added to AmigaDOS 3.0 to enable transportation of data from MS-DOS machines. AmigaDOS 3.0 also includes a Postscript printer driver. Scott ran some popular benchmark programs that placed the Amiga 4000 30 to 500 times faster than an Amiga 3000/25 depending on what the benchmark measured. The Amiga 4000 is an amazing machine for a list price of $3695.

MCCC members and guests. METCOM 92 included classes on Telecommunications, AmigaDOS/WorkBench, CanDo, the Video Toaster and others.

Join us in November on the 2nd Thursday for more Amiga fun. Also, remember that MCCC Central resumes the normal meeting time of the 3rd Thursday in December.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

At our October meeting we got a look at the new A4000, and got some bits and pieces of info from

This piece of hardware comes in 4 basic flavors from the low-end VXL-30 with a MC68EC030 running at 25MHz to a unit with a MC68030 running at 50MHz. The difference between the EC030 and a regular 030 is that the EC030 has the MMU removed and is therefore significantly cheaper for Motorola to produce. Since AmigaDOS does not directly use an MMU (memory management unit) this should be of no serious consequence. The VXL-30 can be expanded with 32 bit RAM memory up to 8 MBytes. This significantly increases the performance of the board. It achieves this in two ways: 1. by using 32Bit RAM the processor is doubling the speed it can get code and data. (32 Bit vs 16 Bit); and 2. by implementing a hardware method of dumping the kickstart ROM into the 32 bit RAM so that all OS calls now execute out of fast RAM. This means that there really is no need for the MMU, which is the more usual method used by accelerators. The only other thing you need to add is a math co-processor 68881 or 68882.

Amiga-by-the-Loop would like to extend our thanks to Darren for his presentation.

So how much will this set up drain your bank account? Well that depends on configuration and dealer pricing. It seems to be a very economical way for A500 users to increase their computing power.

The Loop chapter hopes to see you all at our next meeting in November.

## CHAPTER NEWS

David Marshall of Metropolitan Computers. I won't go into details here (you'll hear enough about it elsewhere, I imagine), but the new critter is based on a new chip set and is reportedly exceptionally fast. Lots of games don't work on the A4000 (aawwww...), although more applications do function with the "copyback mode" feature disabled. No, the Toaster doesn't run in an A4000...but they're working on it.

Amiga-based Virtual Reality game: how would you like to pilot a beastie like "Robocop's" adversary "ED209", against up to 4 human or computer. run opponents? If we get enough interest generated, we might plan a "field trip" some evening to visit this wonder. Who's game?

Speaking of opponents, OUR elections are relatively free of mudslinging, as the slate of Club Officers to be voted on next meeting sounds

November gathering! (How 'bout YOU volunteering?)

After the business is out of the way, we'll be looking at PageStream and other Desktop Publishing packages. Come see how it's done! We'll also hear about METCOM, I'm sure. I didn't make it this year, so I'm looking forward to some reviews. One thing I've done for a few years is do some Christmas shopping at METCOM: I buy memberships for

Our shareware feature was again Tool Manager, which is severely hobbled under 1.3 but does wonderful things under 2.0. I believe the latest version is 2.0, which may be on our BBS, although the last version on a club SuperDisk was 1.5. Check it out! We got an update on the latest like a great bunch. Come cast your official ballot to welcome them! We'll also nominate officers for our chapter next month, and we will NOT enjoy the services of our present president Henry Ribron next year, as work conflicts take him from us. Bring your ideas for nominations to the

some special relatives and friends. I'll miss the METCOM discount this year, but it's still a great idea for those Amiga-owning friends-whohave-everything (well, not everything, but you're NOT buying them a Toaster!)

Our presentation this month

## CHAPTER NEWS

was InfoChannel, from SCALA. This Scandinavian company (the name means "ladder") actually has a fourtiered slate of multi-media presentation products, from a lowmemory minimum-function version, Scala 500, to Video Studio (higher RAM requirements, faster, more buffering), to InfoChannel, and soonto-come MM200. M-ulti M-edia MM200 will allow more control over the timing of music/sounds, and will offer many new transitions. All the packages offer transitions, titling, playing of animations, etc. The demonstrated package, InfoChannel, uses ASCII-file scripts to call up Amiga functions to load and display/play your audio-visual data. "Pages" are sequenced within "decks" , and identify wipes, wait times, music samples to play, animations, etc. Yes, there's a CanDo flavor here, but this offers just presentation aids, with little of the "programming" features of CanDo. Scripts are upward compatible from the other applications, and will be compatible with the new version of InfoChannel also coming. Features to admire include the ability to schedule "pages" to run on a calendar basis, and modem handling to send your latest scripts to remote sites painlessly. You get a bunch of screen fonts and symbols and brushes to play with, too. Neat stuff! The City of Richardson uses InfoChannel on a couple of cable-TV channels for job announcements, etc. Nice to see another Amiga product actually in use locally. Hats off to David Marshall for another interesting demo.

Last but not least: Our doorprize pile was stacked high with goodies yet again. Thanks, Metropolitan, for adding a fun touch to the evenings of these winners: Duane Baade won Airstrike USA, Pastor won Multimedia FX, Eddie Corr won Purple Saturn Day, Curtis Libey won a "World of Commodore"

mug, Danny Barnett won a "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" game, Randy Pavlica won Heart of the Dragon, Ned Kelly won Multimedia FX, Randy Edwards won a "World of Commodore" mug, and Forrest McKinney DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING! Now, all of you with new games to play, be sure to bring them (and your Amiga!) to the December meeting, when we traditionally have munchies and games as the highlights. It's been a season, so forgive me if I miswrote your readings or misread my writings. See you next month!

## Amiga West Ben Clingerman

At the October meeting our new president Eddie Monjay opened the meeting by showing us the new Amiga 600. The Amiga 600, as you may all know by now, is smaller than a 500 but comes equipped with a built-in 40 meg hard drive. The 2.1 operating system is standard which makes this a very attractive package, especially for students or someone with limited workspace.

Eddie also demonstrated Workbench 3.0 on his 040 Amiga 2000. This is a new and very powerful operating system. The 3.0 n. The 50 Workbench allows you to change languages on your machine by simply moving a slider over a picture of the

![Image](1992_11_artifacts/image_000012_0f8f96c5b38228d121293c1bfb65d5f0a6047713966ab7ad6934f60b134346a0.png)

world map to pinpoint what country your language is from. Also, the color slider bars have been replaced by a new color wheel which allows you to mix various palettes. 3.0 software will work on the Amiga 2000,500 or 600 with some limitations due to requiring the new AA chipsets for some functions. The 3.0 operating system was developed for the new A4000 with all its new hardware, but will work with the new 2.0 ROMs in other machines with some limitations.

Next month is game month at Amiga West...so bring a game you would like to show everyone.

Attendance was good at our October meeting, and we were glad to have a visit from Okley Moss, the club's BBS coordinator.

John Burt, continuing his search through the club library, presented Disk #554, which contains a variety of good programs. First there was VDOS, which includes a fast loader to speed up the other programs. Next came Cale ul.03, a spreadsheet with plenty of instructions an on-screen tutorial; then he demonstrated File Drawer, a simple database that can search or sort on any field. Finally, there was Blue Thunder, a helicopter rescue game fro those who were getting tired of office work.

Brenda Sessums demonstrated a Loadstar disk that was full of music, games, and such. She showed the Vorpal Utility Kit, which can check a disk drive for proper alignment and speed.

It turned out that October was not the month for chapter officer nominations, but November is, so that will be an important part of our next meeting. We'll meet on November 14 at 1:30 p.m., in Room 506 at TCOM.
