## METCOM 92

## The Best is Yet to Come! by David Owens

F RED!!! That's right. Absolutely FREE! The Best Commodore computer show in the Metroplex is Free. And there are great things happening all day. Presentations by local dealers and developers. Classes covering a wide range of subjects. A Super Flea Market containing great gems of Amiga &amp; C64/C128 hardware/software. Dealers with great buys on hardware and software and Developers showing off their newest toys. Oh, and don't forget the door prizes. Never forget the door prizes. One more thing, Commodore will be there and there will be some new hardware to look at. I have already confirmed that the Amiga 600HD will be at the show and the Amiga 4000 should make it. Be there to see the exciting introduction of these Awesome new machines.

In my article last month I mentioned how our main emphasis was going to be on the classes. It still is. We just need people to sign up for them. Let's fill all those classes to overflowing. We have a great lineup of subjects to choose from. ARexx is the programming language of choice on the Amiga. AmigaOS 2.0 was such a great improvement over AmigaDOS 1.3, but do you now how to use all the nice features? Or maybe you want to see what it will do before you upgrade. It should be a fantastic class. And you may have asked yourself, "What can CanDo do?" '. You'll find out in the "Everything you wanted to know about CanDo, but were afraid to ask" class. I was talking to the BBS committee the other day and found out they are planning to buy new modems for the BBS. We have a telecommunications class to explain all the in's and out's of using a BBS. And for all of you that LOVE the Video Toaster, there are 6 one-hour classes to overload your senses. The classes are for members and range from $5 to $10. Look for more info somewhere in this newsletter.

There are currently 3 presentations scheduled to happen during the day. All of the presentations are free of charge. Metropolitan is planning on demoing a commercial product for the Amiga called InfoChannel. You'll just have to come and see what this will do. AnSoft will be concentrating on 24 bit manipulation. They will be demoing ASDG's new morphing program. It will knock your socks off when you see what it can do in 24 bits. Last but not least, Commodore will be attending our show this year. We have scheduled for them to come in and do a presentation. All of the details have yet to be worked out, but it should be a blowout. We should see new machines, new software and new operating systems. You don't want to miss this.

Other events that will be happening at METCOM will be the Flea Market, the dealers/developers area, our club booth and door prizes. The flea market has been a part of METCOM ever since I've had anything to do with it. It is one of the reasons I enjoy METCOM. For one thing, I get to sell all the treasures I no longer treasure as much. A little extra cash never hurts when you're looking to buy a 68030. Another reason is I may find that 68030 for a great deal in the flea market. Elsewhere in the newsletter you will find an articie on the flea market and what needs to be done if you're interested in selling your goodies. Like I said previously, our local dealers and developers will be available to sell you the newest products and answer all of your questions on the new products. Come out and support our dealers/developers. They help keep our computers alive and exciting. The club booth will have several things going on. Let me first mention the special deal on club memberships. If you join or renew your membership at METCOM, you will receive 13 months of membership for the price of 12. That's right. 13 months for the price of 12. No joke. And if you renew your BBS membership, you get the same deal. So come by and sign

## From INOVAtronics

CanDo version 2.0

## by Harold Williams

NOVAtronics has released CanDo version 2.0. L ased or as of are are in at seal designed for ease of use. Version 2.0 adds several new features to make application creation easier and faster. There are new tools, enhancements to existing tools, improved configuration control, an improved help system, some bug fixes, and a new manual.

G igaMem is a virtual memory utility, from Relog AG in Germany. It is being distributed by INOVAtronics. Most Amiga applications run quite well (and of course multitask) with fairly limited memory requirements. But there are programs that require large amounts of memory. This is particularly true of programs that process graphics or produce animations. GigaMem can make huge amounts, up to one gigabyte, of hard drive storage available as virtual

GigaMem requires a 68020 or 68030 processor with a Memory Management Unit (MMU). You will also need a hard drive or removable media drive like a SyQuest. GigaMem does not currently support the 68040. GigaMem will run under AmigaDOS 1.2 or 1.3, but 2.0 or higher is recommended.

The GigaMem software is easily installed using Commodore's standard installation program. After installation, the GigaMem Prefs program is used to establish a list of programs that will make use of virtual memory, the location of the virtual memory space, and the size of the buffer used for swapping virtual memory into normal memory. The programs that use virtual memory can be set to use normal memory first, virtual memory first or virtual memory only. The location for the virtual memory can be either a full partition or a file on your harddrive. If a file is used then the size of the file must also be set.

Script Bookmarking is implemented as three new tools. When editing a script a new Bookmark editor tool is available. Using this tool simply marks the script as being included in the "bookmark" list. All scripts that have been bookmarked can be accessed directly from the main CanDo work panel through the new BookMark, and LastBookMark object tools. The BookMark tool presents a list of bookmarked scripts to select from, while the LastBookMark tool moves directly into edit on the most recently edited bookmarked script. Bookmarks can be saved and then loaded in a later work session.

SuperDuper is a new tool that simplifies the placement of objects in rows and columns. A button, field or proportional slider can be duplicated horizontally or vertically or both to create a perfectly aligned series of gadgets. Another new tool is the ObjectLayer tool. ObjectLayer lets you change the order of all the visible objects that make up an application. Reordering the object list accomplishes two things: 1) you can control the order in which buttons, fields, sliders, and documents will "pop" onto the screen and 2) you can set the hierarchy of objects that overlay each other.

The main CanDo panel now has a ConfigCanDo tool. This tool gives you control over CanDo's configuration without exiting CanDo and modifying tooltypes or a configuration file. One of the new configuration options is to turn on a snap-to-grid feature, which is available any time an object is being placed on the screen. The CanDo editor has a new tool named BugBasher that does a thorough syntax analysis of the script. BugBasher can be used to identify almost all syntax problems that formerly would have been found at run time. There is a new DosNotify tool that can be added to a CanDo deck to detect when a file or directory has changed. This tool is only available with AmigaOS 2.0 and later. CanDo now supports screen images up to 1700 x 2200 pixels. Screens larger than the standard display will autoscroll. There is also full support for 68040 processors. (The copy-back mode could not be used with earlier versions of CanDo.)

The new manual combines the previous yellow and white manuals into one large 400 page volume. The manual is loose-leaf notebook style. It will lie flat on a desk, so it is easy to reference as you work. If you've been juggling the two old manuals you will really appreciate this new volume.

![Image](1992_10_artifacts/image_000011_5d37741dc3b91b3645cf67f7b16b152ae46ca1d0a25c157f8cd4e1b1ac05be5a.png)

GigaMem is run by simply double-clicking the GigaMem-Startup icon (or placing it in the WBStartup drawer). When GigaMem is running, the Workbench title bar will display a new type of memory called VMem. The size of the VMem will be the size of the partition or file assigned to GigaMem. As programs make use of the virtual memory the size of the remaining VMem is reflected on the title bar.

I have done some limited testing of GigaMem using an Amiga 2000, with a GVP Series II Hard Disk card, 105 megabyte Quantum hard drive, GVP 3001 28Mhz 68030, and 1 megabytes of RAM. I've used ADPro, DPaint IV, Imagine and Pixel 3D. All have worked flawlessly. Programs do run a little slower when accessing the virtual memory.

GigaMem is a terrific utility for those that want to process data that requires huge quantities of RAM. /

CanDo 2.0 improves on an already fantastic programming environment. This new version can really speed up the process of building an application. CanDo has always been a terrific package. CanDo lets you create real applications without requiring you to be a professional programmer. Now it is even easier.

## Questions? Answers!

## words of wisdom from the answer man, Henry Ribron

## Q: What is a hot key?

A: A hot key is a keyboard shortcut for a function of the software. For example; left amiga-s is the 2.0 hot key for the snapshot function of Workbench. Simply press left amiga and the s key and any highlighted icons will be snapshot in their current locations. Using hot keys can greatly enhance a program. The amiga-p hot key (print) in PageStream is one of my favorites.

Q: What are macros. How do they differ from hot keys? A: Macros are lists of commands, events and/or information assigned to a hot key. Usually macros are user definable.

## Q: Why should I upgrade to 2.0?

A: The benefits of AmigaDOS 2.0 are many. Each user benefits in different ways dependent upon your system and software use.

## Q: What is ARexx/RexxMast?

A: ARexx is a programming language designed to offer flexibility to customize your working environment. ARexx acts as a central hub through which applications may send data and commands to each other. This allows software created by different companies to interact and, in turn, allows the user to create custom applications by integrating off-the-shelf software products. For example, with ARexx it is possible to set up a telecommunications package to dial an electronic bulletin board, download financial data, and then pass that data to a separate spreadsheet for statistical analysis automatically, without user intervention.

## Q: Why should I backup?

A: With a hard drive it is not a matter of if it will crash but when. (This is mainly because it is a mechanical device.) It is also strongly recommend that you make a backup of your floppy-based software to insure against loss of data due to spills, viruses or damage of the floppy.

## Q: How do I find out what chip set I have?

A: There are many PD programs (SysInfo, AIBB) which will try to tell if you have the Enhanced chip set. The only positive way is to have your repair center check the number of the chips installed.

## Q: What is a Syquest?

A: A Syquest drive is one of two removable hard drive models that are popular on the amiga (44M and 88M).

## Q: What is a startup-sequence?

## A: Whenever you boot your Amiga the startup-sequence|

script is executed. This file is located in the S: directory. The startup-sequence file can allocate disk buffers, make device assignments, and perform many other functions that can be accomplished with AmigaDOS commands. With AmigaOS 2.0, it is recommended that you create a user-startup file in the s: directory and make your changes there.

## Q: I get a "dfO:bad" when I put my save disk in the drive. What happened and can I fix it?

A: Your disk is corrupt. Each time a disk is inserted in a drive the operating system checks the disk to see if it is valid. If a disk has not been used before it must be formatted. A formatted disk can also become corrupt for a variety of reasons, but once corrupted it may be possible to repair the disk. There are many programs that will attempt to repair "bad" disks (PD DiskSalu, FixDisk). It is not always possible to fix a bad disk. (We don't recommend the use of DiskDoctor.)

## Q: How can I make Workbench use more colors?

A: Under 1.3 you can use a program like 8Color or HamBench (PD) to force Workbench to use more colors. Under 2.0 in the Prefs drawer use ScreenMode to set the number of colors you want.

## Q: One of my drawers disappeared from Workbench. Where is it?

A: If you move an icon on top of a drawer icon and let go of the left mouse button, Workbench will move that icon and its file inside the drawer. This is a common problem. Just open the drawer and move to icon back where it belongs. In 1.3 there is a bug that can cause random drawer loss. Just look inside all drawers 'til you find it.

## Q: I deleted some files in a drawer and the whole drawer disappeared. What happened?

A: When you opened the drawer its icon is selected. You pressed the shift key first, then selected the files you wanted to delete. This means the drawer was also still selected... and deleted. It is best to click the mouse in a empty spot, without the shift key, before making any selections.

## Q: What is chip Ram?

Have a Question? Write: Questions, 5511 Richmond Ave., Dallas, TX 75206-7151. Include a phone number. d

A: It is the area of RAM accessible to the Amiga's custom chip set. This memory is used for graphics and sound data. It is also called graphics memory. This is why you can get an "Out of Memory" error while you still have memory free. The chip memory is full.

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

P ictures This month is an unusually good month to add some pictures to your collection. On MCCC-A\_435 you'll find a whole disk of outstanding scanned-in images that really show off the powers of our favorite computer. The most impressive in my opinion? Look for Orca-Calf and Orca-Jump (for the animal lovers among us) and Lush (for those who like their nature shots sans animals). They are outstanding. And on MCCC-A \_436 are a couple of more "must have" pictures — shots of our very own Earth as taken from space. Be sure to check them all out.

## Mostra 1.07 by Sebastiano Vigna

Speaking of pictures, on MCCC-A\_436 is an update to the best picture viewer around, Mostra. It's the only picture viewer around that will handle all the picture formats I throw at it — and it has slideshow capabilities as well. There's nothing really new in this version, but it will handle a picture format now that would have had the last version stumped.

## Postscript Fonts

Orca-Jump

One of the beautiful images available this month.

Look for it on MCCC-A\_435

Naturally, this is another good month for PageStream users. We have a lot of new Postscript Type 1 fonts to use this month. There are four new ones on MCCC-A\_437 and another ten on MCCC-A\_440.

## Music

For all those music collections out there, this month offers a few that may be worth adding. There are four tracker pieces on MCCC-A \_438 (Agony\_Intro is outstanding), four more on MCCC-A 439 (f'roglegs is one of the best ragtime pieces I've heard on the Amiga), and one more on MCCC-A 440.

## Flying Toasters by Gernot Reisinger

You may have seen the Flying Toasters screen blanker running on the MacIntosh or even the (ugh!) PC. If you liked it, here is your chance to have your very own copy running on your favorite computer. If you haven't seen it, what you can expect is a bunch of cute little flying toasters (the two slice variety), complete with flapping wings, that fly from the upper right hand corner of your screen to the opposite corner. To keep things interesting, individuals within the flock (it is a flock of toasters, isn't it?) fly at different speeds. And once in a while one will do mid-air cartwheels just for the fun of it, or another may pause to look directly at you. You have control over the

other words, you don't have to build a script file on your own. If you can drag an icon you can build a menu. (If you can't drag an icon it's time you made it to one of the MCCC's Beginner's Classes.) Another reason it's better is that there is no useless menu devoted to ToolsDaemon as there was with ParM. All the menu space is yours to use as you want. For control, the program adds a "ToolsPrefs..." item to the "Tools" menu that calls up the menu building program. The only disadvantage to this one is that, unlike ParM, ToolsDaemon will run only under AmigaOS 2.0. Of course, if you don't have 2.0 yet it's high time you got it. You'll find ToolsDaemon on MCCC-A\_140.

![Image](1992_10_artifacts/image_000014_a10b713ef0219586554b41b92bfdb7b46e9d889e2d2ac7754dc3ba7c1c66586c.png)

number of toasters and their speed. Fewer toasters and a slower speed will use less computer power... which could be important if you leave things going unattended (like a ray-tracing program). It's silly but it's kind of cute - and a definite change from the usual screen blanker. It runs only under AmigaOS 2.0 (or greater). You'll find it on MCCC-A\_439.

## ToolsDaemon by Nico Francois

A couple of months ago, in the August issue of the MCCC News, I wrote about ParM... a utility that allows you to add menus for your favorite applications to your Workbench screen. Well, ToolsDaemon does the same thing — only better. How is it better, you ask? Well, for one thing, the interface is totally Intuition driven. In

## Dallas Video Festival

coming November 5-8 at the Dallas Museum of Art

¡ he Dallas Video Festival will return for its sixth year November 5-8 at the Dallas Museum of Art. One of the largest video festivals in the United States, the Dallas Video Festival is presented by the Video Association of Dallas and the Dallas Museum of Art. Over 5,000 people attend the four-day event each year, which includes over 250 screenings, installations, panel discussions and technology demonstrations presented simultaneously in multiple areas within the Museum. A day pass encourages Festival goers to move from room to room, giving audiences the opportunity to create their own viewing schedule.

From vintage TV to high definition TV, video profoundly touches our lives every day," said Festival Director Barton Weiss. "The Dallas Video Festival gives us perspective on the wide variety of image and messages we receive. We can become more than couch potatoes, we can be active, aware viewerg."

The Festival's programming covers a broad range of topics: from the TV coverage of the Presidential elections to the The bondon International Awards Competition, showcasing international commercials; from The Fair, a woman's recollection of the 1964 World's Fair and her coming of age, to Animal Appetites, a documentary about cultural mores; from Wax-Discovery of Television Among the Bees, a masterpiece of virtual surreality to Fast Food Women, a sociodocumentary of Appalachian Mountain women and their lifestyles; from Revolutional War Filmstrip, an off-beat look at the Revolutionary War to Cheerleaders, a documentary from an Israeli videomaker in Lafayette, Indiana; from a selection of cutting edge Japanese Animation to Low and Slow, the lure of lowriders; from Hate Mail, a local look at racism to Protect Your Family's Health, a retrospective selection of '60s educational videos; from new works by performance artist Teddy Dibble to The Civil War Parody; and from a new video by artist dohn Sanborn, to The Columbus Project, an interactive educational exhibit.

Also at this year's festival will be: The Video Work of Andy Warhol, presented by John Hanhardt of the Whitney Museum; Newsroom, a look at KERA-TV Channel 13's vintage news show; and a discussion on Dallas' high technology industry. A new teature will be The NonBroadcast Show, presented in conjunction with the Dallas Producers Association, which will showcase corporate and industrial videos produced locally. The Interactive Room, featuring hands-on interactive installations, will provide a look at New Media and the artists who are using this new tool. On display, as well, will be High Definition TV. The Festival also offers programs that have become Festival mainstays since their introduction in 1987 — KIDVID programs and workshops for children; SIGGRAPH; The

Texas Show, featuring new work by Texas artists; The Amiga Show, and refreshments in the TV Diner.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-loop Pete Goad

Wow! August shot by faster than I expected! September meeting has already gone... and well, OK, I goofed and missed the deadline for the previous newsletter. (Slap around head with wet fish etc.). My humble apologies for that slip up and it might not happen again. At this point, you are probably asking yourself what DID happen in August? Well I'm glad you asked.

would get maybe 20 minutes of use - that assumes no disk activity of any form. So until Commodore produces a CMOS version of the chipset, it is unlikely that a true portable will be available soon.

The August Loop meeting was attended by 30 people who eagerly awaited the keynote address from Mike Weaver, the local Commodore Account Executive. Mike began by giving us his history with Commodore followed by a question and answer session, started in earnest at Mike's request. He did, however, state that there would be some items that he either could not or would not comment on. Fortunately there were not too many of those items.

It then transpired that the World Of Commodore (WOC) show in September would introduce some new products from Commodore. The most interesting of these will be the A4000 machine. The specifications for this machine have been around for a while now, although up to this point they had never been confirmed. Mike was hopeful that he would be able to attend the upcoming MCCC's METCOM with some of the new hardware direct from the WOC show.

Other items that Mike clarified was that current machines are shipping with V2.05 ROMs. It apparently fixes a minor bug and is not worth updating to. A patch file will be made available in the near future. The "PORTABLE" is not a viable option due to the technology used to make the current chipset. This technology is extremely power hungry and, as such, even using state of the art battery packs you

For those that were not present at the meeting, SCALA is a presentation package or Information Display System similar to AMIGAVision, but, from what I saw, more flexible and friendly. Info Channel is SCALA's big brother. It offers scheduling and a whole host of other features. It has probably the easiest interface this author has seen in a long time. The new version shrinks down the graphic and allows you to see a miniaturized version of the final display. All the synchronization for sound is handled with the mouse making it exceptionally easy to use. Altogether a thoroughly professional package. If Mike does his job right, we should see Amigas in little kiosks with this information display system.

At the end of this lively Q &amp; A session, Mike introduced us to Info Channel, an upgraded SCALA with some added extras. SCALA was originally distributed in the US via Great Valley Products, however it has been updated by its Norwegian designers and many new features have been added. The most notable of these is a scheduling system within the software package.

Amiga By-The-Loop would like to thank Mike for the information and also for the demonstration of Info Channel.

The September meeting was hosted by yours truly, who I may say did an excellent impersonation of the Loop President! The usual welcome complete, we mentioned the upcoming METCOM in October, and the fact that there would be classes for many different applications used on the Amiga. Also the ever-present FLEA MARKET would be there, with yours truly heading that project up. So if you have hardware or software

This month's presentation was Domark's Virtual Reality Studio ably demonstrated by Aaron Lozier. This package allows you to create your own world and then live it! (Some of us daydream like that). Aaron has created his own world that he invited us all to visit. He introduced his neighborhood first and then his house. The house includes all the standard things you would expect in your home, including a computer that was downloading a program using JR-Comm and then crashing with a GURU! (No reflection on JRComm's abilities). Unfortunately Aaron left his Garden world back at his real house.

or books from any of the Commodore machines that you would like to get some cash for, then let me know. My phone number is in the back of this newsletter, or see one of the club officers in your chapter. But enough of this, what did we have presented at this month's meeting?

Aaron then showed us how to create a simple world using the commands from the Virtual Reality Studio editor. The editor uses combinations of point &amp; lick interfaces and a language called FreeScape 3D. The editor is where some of the limitations are revealed. The screen is limited to Low-Res with a maximum of 16 colors - and sound effects can only be used if they are in the RAW format. No IFF compatibility there, sadly. He then proceeded to show us an interactive adventure game that he has been working on called Mysterious Mansion. Aaron also showed us how to cheat, by returning to the editor and setting up the next stage! Our thanks to Aaron for his presentation of Virtual Reality Studio.

We finished up this month's meeting with some demos from Europe. These are generally put together by "Hackers". (I use the term loosely, because these people wring every last ounce of power out of the Amiga to create these amazing

## CHAPTER NEWS

demos.) If you missed them, there are some in the library. Mental Hangover is worth a look.

The Loop chapter hopes to see you all at our next meeting in October. (Remember, METCOM is not very far away!!)

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

## Amiga Central Ray Howard

September started off with a discussion of our upcoming METCOM'92 event. Check your newsletter for all the details. The new Amigas were excitedly discussed. The Amiga 4000 will be a leap ahead in the machine's capabilities. Just a few of the facts about the 4000 are 25,000 colors out of a palette of 16.8 million, a 24-bit capable video slot, and AmigaOS 3.0.

Harold Williams demostrated several interesting products, both commercial and shareware. The first product was ToolManager which gives you the ability to start applications from the WB Tools menu, the WB window, or a NeXT style docking strip. Next was Virus\_Checker, a program to sniff out viruses in your system. Virus\_Checker will check floppy disks, memory, and disk files for various viruses or other oddities that may be unknown viruses. The third product was GigaMem from INOVAtronics. GigaMem provides virtual memory for Amigas that have a memory managment unit, such as all '030 and '040 based machines and some '020 boards. Harold was able to define 5MB of virtual memory for Art Department Pro to use and still have better than 4MB of RAM free in his machine that only has 5MB of RAM total. Last but distinctly not least, Harold showed us CanDo 2.0 and many of the new features available with it.

Join is in October for more Amiga-based fun and information. Don't forget about METCOM'92!

Many of us who needed help with the MCCC BBS gathered early last month for David Byrne's BBS Class, prior to the regular chapter meeting. We got to observe and try out the various BBS offerings, and learned a lot. Thanks, Dave!

The TidByte section: We heard a glowing recommendation for the HP500C color printer, but some have trouble finding a driver. There's a commercial one and a PD version available, though. Mark Henry and Jack Chang held a "tag-team" style mini-press conference about the demise of The Edge as a retail outlet. We will certainly miss The Edge's many contributions and personnel, and hope to see them all in other capacities at our gatherings. (Don't forget their feeding frenzy on thom. ise A4000 clearance stock. Ought to be fun.) News from the Pasadena Amiga show: the A4000 and A600 were made official, coming out with AmigaOS 2.1 and 3.0. Specs were passed around, along with threats if said specs did not return to their owners. We saluted the Shareware program Tool Manager by Stefan Becker, which adds icons to iconless programs, adds to your Workbench menu bar, etc. Brett loves it. It is on a 2.0 Club Superdisk, but "sort of works" under 1.3. Check it out. Kyle Mardis of Vertical, Inc. announced a new organization to support video professionals, to be called "Amiga Video Association (AVA)". They are trying to become nationwide, and welcome anyone with video-related needs or experience to join them. They will offer publications, meetings, seminars, etc. John Chang is their spokesperson, and Brett Hester is president of their Dallas chapter. (This group is absorbing the Dallas Toaster Society.) AVA plans to meet at Infomart from 1-4 p.m. on October 17th. They will work to spread the good news about the Amiga as a video tool and provide support and a user network to those already convinced.

Our September demo was an introduction to the AD1012 Sound Board, by SunRize, presented by Dave Marshall. The AD1012 can sample audio input and record it to disk, at a sample rate greater than a CD. A CD records 16-bit data, and the coming-later AD516 will handle 16-bit data and replay on 8 channels. The long sample (3 minutes) Dave played for us took up 16 meg of disk. The quality was excellent! The display offered little dials like a fancy stereo to help you balance the 4 recorded channels and any additional input to your liking, using a slide bar on each channel. To save on disk space, a lower sample rate could be selected, trading storage for quality. You can cut and paste chunks of your music, record channels separately and hand-mix them, even reverse a section. (Try Vivaldi backwards! VERY wierd!) Due to the tremendous disk rate, it appears to require a "clean" (non-fragmented) disk so all the data can be accessed contiguously. Trying to pull four tracks separately from all over the disk and mix them and keep up with the incredible sample rate gave the system a nervous breakdown! The AD1012 costs $595. Expect the AD516 to be $1495.

We were running late but very enthusiastic, so Dave brought out another product, OpalVision, a new 24-bit video package. It comes with a card that plugs into your video slot, and the monitor connects to it. OpalVision comes with a heckuva paint program, Opallaint. It has, among other things, "real" palettes, where you can put different paint "blobs" and actually "stir" them to your liking. We had a photo quality image of a girl on the screen, and zoomed up to check out the threads in her knit scarf. You can work on an image bigger than the screen and

## CHAPTER NEWS

scroll around, or scale the image to fit the screen. Instead of loading images by just filename, you can create "thumbnail" images of the pictures and click on the one you like from the full-color menu! You can cut out three brushes at once, and you are presented with a whole screen full of things to do to the selected brush. How about selecting the art medium (water color, chalk, pencil, airbrush) and the paper texture? The only thing this package seemed to be missing was animation. We had to tie Brett down, he was so excited. Coming in a future release: genlock functions and a frame grabber to manipulate live video. Just frosting on the cake: OpalPresents, a slideshow application with many transition effects. (No legs.) Whee! Thanks, Dave! What a show!

The Edge also gave us a muchdesired Star Trek Mouse Pad, which William Dockendorf won and had BETTER show off at his library station next month. A couple of August's Euro-magazines returned for new homes (they had come from The Edge, too), and they were won by Karl Zettl and our champion 7-out-of8-meetings Door-Prize-Scarfer, Forrest McKinney. We don't know how he does it!!! Our friends at Metropolitan contributed War Zone (which went to Tom Brooks), The Munsters (claimed by Russell Johnson), and Dragon Strike (won by our BBS instructor, Dave Byrne). Thanks, ever-generous dealers!

Our Door Prizes in September: Alan Somers won The Carl Lewis Challenge, donated by The Edge.

Next month: Sonia King of Metropolitan will bring us InfoChannel, a rofessional presentation system, and IF they come out in time, maybe an A4000! Don't forget METCOM... sign up in advance for the excellent classes, get your flea market stuff to your chapter's representative by the 17th, and plan to spend a fun and informative day! (Amiga North Dallas, your flea-bagger is Eddie Corr, (214) 423-1947.)

## Amiga West Ben Clingerman

Amiga West September meeting topic: Amiga West or not? I'm happy to say Amiga West is still alive and well. We will meet October 8th at 7:30 pm in Room 106, Building 2 of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine... also the same room for the November 12th meeting.

John Belyeu, at his own expense, sent out a survey to all registered Amiga West Chapter members to see if there was anything that they wanted changed in our chapter... such as day of meeting, time of meeting, presentations, if merging with another chapter was

needed? Various questions. All in all, the members wanted Amiga West to continue. But we still needed a new President and Vice President to replace our out-going officers. Noone would volunteer so as you see we were in a pickle.

Well... we just happened to acquire three new members this month and out of those three two said they'd love to hold an office. So everyone meet our new President, Eddie Monjay and our new Vice President, Mike Wagman. Eddie and Mike are very enthusiastic about the MCCC and are planning already for an even better Amiga West chapter. Welcome aboard Eddie and Mike!

Everyone come by and greet our new members October 8th. Have an Amiga day!

## Arl/Grand Praire Brad Dumler

Those who attended the Arlington/Grand Prairie chapter meeting in September were treated to some interesting discussions of word processors. Several of the major C64/C128 commercial word processors were mentioned. One of those heard about and seen was GEOwrite, the program included with all versions of GEOS. The most prominent feature of GEOwrite is its WYSIWYG environment. You get to see on the screen all of the frills that you are going to get when your document is printed (if everything goes correctly). And there are numerous fonts and effects that can be incorporated into the text. It also has the ability to embed graphics into your documents. So if fancy output is what you yearn, then GEOwrite is just the thing. Even though the developer of GEOS has ceased developing products for our machines, there is still plenty of support around because of the enormous popularity of the GEOS operating system. Many vendors carry the GEOS product line, and online systems such as Q-Link and GEnie have numerous public domain and shareware titles for you to download. These systems also offer various forms of technical support from staff and user experts. You can find much in print about GEOS also.

Another word processor discussed was The Write Stuff (my favorite). It has many powerful features to do complex document creating and printing tasks. The user interface is menu-driven for most of the essentials, and has numerous keyboard commands for those more demanding processing needs. TWS operates much differently than word processors like GEOwrite, and is aimed toward a little different document creation task. It is still supported by the programmer, who is working on a new C128 version with some potentially wonderful desktoppublishing capablities. You can also find quite a few assessories for enhancing TWS via the on-line services, through the Busy Bee User Group, or from the authorprogrammer.

There was some general discussion about the upcoming METCOM event and about our possible participation and assured support thereof. Nothing definite was announced, but our leaders will

![Image](1992_10_artifacts/image_000018_4f897754fbdfb5a607f1dfae5a9d18502374f99c07a3b61b2ea3dbf100918ea5.png)

try to get some activities put together for the show to make everyone's attendence interesting and worthwhile.

Finally, at the October meeting we will hear about and see some graphics packages for C64s and C128s. No discussion of graphics software would be complete without some discussion of GEOpaint, so be looking for that. Other possibilities are BASIC 8 for the C128, and Fun Graphics Machine for the C64. Bring some of your favorite graphics images to share with the rest of us.

Hope to see you at the meeting and at METCOM.

## Fort Worth Mary Louise Hagemeyer

This time we moved to Room 506, a big theater-type lecture room that we can plan to use for future meetings.

John Burt distributed a catalogue he had made of the club library. This alphabetical list of program names with disk numbers makes it easier to find the programs we want from the thousands available in the library. Our thanks to John for a job well done.

Brenda Sessums showed how she works with GEOS using a C64 with 512K RAM expansion and 1541 and 1581 disk drives. She uses the 1541 just to boot GEOS; thereafter she uses the RAM expansion and fast disk drive to avoid the annoying delays that turned many of us away from GEOS in the first place. She had loaded GEOcalc, GEOfile, and GEOpublish on one 1581 disk, making it easier to use those programs together.

Next month we'll look at a spreadsheet from the library and maybe watch a picture-printing program. It's time to nominate next year's officers too. We'll meet on October 10 at 1:30 pm, in Room 506 at TCOM.
