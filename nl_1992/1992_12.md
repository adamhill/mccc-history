## spikes &amp; surges &amp; safety by Greg R. Guthman of CUCUG

Y ou have heard the weather forecasts. You know you just "have" to get that last image rendered, but hey, you don't want to cook your best friend with the impending doom of an electrical blast from God! What is a conscientious hacker supposed to do?

There seems to be a lot of confusion and sales hype concerning the safety of your power supply. Opinions range from "When there is a cloud in the sky, I pull the plug" to "Hey, why worry, be happy." However, we are ALL at risk of hardware failure due to power problems, and the biggest danger is present even when there is NOT a cloud in the sky! The system that we take for granted to deliver us power is riddied with surges, spikes, notches, sags, collectively called "electrical noise."

A spike (or sudden rise in voltage) as small as 0.5 volts at the chip level can cause errors in computing; 10 volts can cause irreparable damage. Most of the problems that we see on a day to day basis are not the "hard" failures of components, but "soft" failures of the system, such as unexplained "lock-ups" or garbled data on the modem or printer showing up from nowhere. Repeated attacks of this sort eventually cause component failure. This becomes even more likely as integrated circuit manufacturers pack more and more into a smaller physical package, more susceptible to electrical noise damage. The main sources of electrical noise are the utility company, the internal environment and lightning.

## The Utility Company

As demand for power increases, extra resources are brought on-line by a process called "grid switching." This involves turning on generators and even whole power plants many miles away to add to the pool of electrical power. The power company tries to do this smoothly, but it always produces a "notch" or brief dropout in power. The system also switches in and out banks of capacitors in a process called "power factor correction." This compensates for heavy industrial loads, but creates a burst of electrical noise.

## Internal Environment

Everything from coffee pots to fluorescent lights throws electrical noise back into your power system. Even computer peripherals can add to the problem. Grounded distribution systems exhibit two types of line noise: Normal-node and common-node noise. Normal-node noise takes place between the Neutral and Line (power) wires. Common-node noise takes place between Ground and Line wires. Normal-node is less likely to cause problems; modern power supplies filter most of this out. Commonnode noise, harmless to most loads, causes problems because the safety ground is normally coupled to the computer's reference ground.

## Lightning

Although this is not the most common form of electrical noise, it can be deadly to an unprotected computer system. Even if lightning strikes many miles away, it can result in voltage "spikes" (short duration elevated voltages) and "surges" (longer duration) in the power lines.

Now we know what the problems are — all we have to do is eliminate them. A general home inspection is a good place to start. If you're not comfortable with electricity and breaker boxes, you might want to call an electrician. An inspection of the grounding system of your electrical junction box can return big rewards if you find loose connections. Even loud thunder can shake ground connections loose and cause dropouts.

There is one long bar along the side of most breaker boxes. This attaches to somewhere outside or to a cold water pipe for an earth ground. Again, if you have never taken the cover off a breaker box, get someone who has. If you have a voltage meter, make sure there is less than a 5% drop of voltage between the breaker box and any branch circuit. You can also turn everything you own on

## Bisfoot

## replacement power supply for the A500 by Allen W. Wadle

purchased a Bigfoot Power Supply to replace the to power my Trumpcard 500 expansion box with its SCSI controller card, 4 meg additional SIMM memory, and 120 meg hard drive. This is a 200 watt power supply that comes with a cable to plug into the back of the A500, plus four other cables that can be used to power other external devices. The purpose of this review is to commend Micro R. &amp; D., the makers of Bigfoot, for their excellent service. I purchased the power supply mail order from Grapevine since I could save over 25% by doing this rather than buying locally. The first unit wouldn't

![Image](1992_12_artifacts/image_000005_21e4b63b725cba794508d87a4d10428fffc894bf4bb9c292a6a063fd66be6f6f.png)

work properly. I phoned Micro R. &amp; D. and they suggested that I open the case to see if it had a pot or hard-wired resistor. Since my unit had the resistor, they said for me to send the unit back to them. The turnaround was exceptional. I received my replacement unit within seven days of the time that we mailed it. In addition, Micro R. &amp; D. sent me a custom adapter plug to use with the Trumpcard unit so that I wouldn't have to splice on my own plug. This is response to a customer's needs that goes beyond what anyone could consider as required. Everything is now working fine with the Bigfoot powering the expansion box directly as well as my A500.

at once and place an Ammeter (current meter) on the lines going into the box. Make sure you are not pulling more than 80% of the rated current for that circuit (typically 20 Amps). You can exclude the items that have dedicated breakers such as washers or dryers.

The final and most important step is to invest in a line conditioner. There are three types on the market: surge, spike and RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) protectors. Any system you purchase should have all three of these elements and should be rated for at least 35-40% more current than you draw. RFI protection is accomplished through filters or "chokes" that eliminate frequency interference from affected power lines. Lowcost surge protectors, utilizing Metal-Oxide Varistors (MOV), will divert some spikes but will completely "open" when a big one hits, much like a fuse. (Since the MOV shunts the surge to ground, it becomes useless if it blows.) True surge and spike protection requires isolation transformers that "level out" fluctuations in voltage.

Finally, there's the Uninterruptible Power Supply or UPS. This is a good option if the UPS is designed well.

Good systems will provide 100% perfect power that has been "inverted" from a battery system. The A.C. power is used to keep the batteries changed; if the power source is terrible, so what! Of course, the main benefit is that if the source drops out completely, you will still have access to your system until the battery drains. UPS systems can keep you up for minutes or hours, depending on the load and capacity. As with line conditioners, these systems should not be loaded above 80% of their rated capacity no matter what some sales person says. Some UPS systems simply pass the A.C. power through to your system and "activate" a battery backup when a power loss is detected. Systems like this typically include less line conditioning than a separate unit, and some manufacturers even recommend you purchase one of theirs! There is also the problem of the "switching time" it takes to get you back the power you lost. This can hurt your computer as mentioned above.

Now you should be able to make some sound choices about protecting your computer investment and sit back and laugh at the bad weather!

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke usic Last month there was an outstanding · classical number included in the library. This month there's more. On MCCC-A 453 are three pieces by Bach in the MED format. There is a MED player included on the disk to make it easy to play. On the same disk is a piece called Circus that is also worth checking out. Also worth checking out are InGame, Major Tom and Space Traveling on MCCC-A\_454; MemoryDust on MCCC-A\_461; Silents on MCCC-A\_462; and Crow Nose Fear on MCCC-A 463.

## Clipart from TECHNA-Graphies

This month we have a collection of Halloween clipart from TECHNA-Graphics. This is a sample collection from a company that will be producing commercial clipart for the Amiga. It's a little late for Halloween this year but they'll still be good next year. (The clips were on the BBS in plenty of time...but it takes a little longer to get them on a club disk.) These are in Professional Draw format so they can be used with Professional Page or Pagestream. They're on MCCC-A 464.

## MARELE HIGH NOON

Melodbold

## WBClean by Nicola Salmoria

This is a small little utility for Workbench 2.0. If you've ever found yourself with lots of windows open on the Workbench that you are done with, this utility is made for you. Instead of closing each one with the close gadget, just execute this program and ALL the windows are closed for you — automatically. No muss, no fuss. For easy access, I have it tied into a Tool Manager menu. It works great from there. You'll find this one on MCCC-A\_458.

## PageStream Updates from Soft Logik

On MCCC-A \_ 454 are several updates to PageStream. There are updated import modules for DR2D, ProDraw, and IFF ILBM files. There is also a new printer driver for the HP DeskJet 550C.

## CrossDOS 5.05 Patch from Consultron

Last month we had an upgrade in the library to update CrossDOS from any 5.0 version to 5.04. Same thing this month - only this time we go to version 5.05. If you are a CrossDOS owner, you'll need this. No new features — just bug fixes. It's on MCCC-A\_ \_ 459.

## Quarterback 5.0.3 from Central Coast Software

While we're on the subject on upgrades to commercial products, Quarterback users will want to get this update to version 5.0.3. This is a bug fix upgrade. The main improvement seems to be more reliable backups

with file compression turned on. Disk MCCC-A\_463 contains only the upgrade from 5.0.2 to 5.0.3. Upgrades to get you to version 5.0.2 can be found on earlier club disks.

## Workbench Pies

Maybe you thought I quit. It's been a couple of months since 1 added any new Workbench background pics to the club library. But this month I'm back at it. There are three nice pics on MCCC-A on MCCC-A\_465. As before, these are designed to work on a 640 x 400, 16-color Workbench screen. You'll need NickPrets to use them, but the color palettes are included as well as an ARexx script that chooses a picture randomly at startup time from the pictures installed in your system.

## Magnetic Media

some myths and truths by Keith Faulkner of the Lansing Area Commodore Club

![Image](1992_12_artifacts/image_000011_47618489b6aa9f4918b0ff4bcfeb288bac3e1af297e1955b3f022f243916814a.png)

W e all know that magnetism can destroy data on tapes and diskettes, but how much magnetism does how much damage?

Widespread curiosity prompted the U.S. National Bureau of Standards to conduct various experiments in order to find the answer to that question. The results have been published in the publications of a number of universities. The experiments verified the theory that the effect of a magnet falls off as the cube of the distance. Double the distance and the magnet's ability to cause data loss is divided by eight. Here are some of the results achieved and some of the myths exploded in the process.

## - MYTH -

A small magnet such as the holder of a flashlight can damage tapes and diskettes some distance away.

## - TRUTH -

A one thousand oersted magnet, capable of lifting 40 pounds, was brought to within one inch of a computer tape. No data loss resulted. At the range of 1/2 inch, the magnet effectively destroyed the data. The read-write head, virtually in contact with the media, has a field strength of 750 to 1000 oersteds. An extraneous field of 200 oersteds causes a loss of data, but one of 150 oersteds does not.

## - MYTH -

Airport metal detectors can damage a tape or diskette.

## - TRUTH -

Walk thru, pass thru and handheld detectors have a field strength far too faint to matter. If you are keeping score, it's 5 oersteds. So save your worrying for the luggage. Your data is just as safe as you are. [Editor's note: This does not necessarily apply to X-Ray baggage inspection machines.]

## - МУТН -

A hidden or overlooked magnet will cause gradual damage.

## - TRUTH -

Time is not a factor. Fortunately for the technology which brings us high speed disks, magnetic particles change their orientation in billionths of a second, so damage is second, so damage e instantaneous or it is negligible. So, if you notice your disk lying on a graphies tablet, do not hasten to snatch it off. The disk was, or was not, damaged the instant it was set down.

## - MYTH...

A large electromagnet can destroy a roomful of tapes and disks with a poorly aimed burst of magnetism.

## - TRUTH -

Distance is still the telling factor. A truly enormous magnet did no damage at a distance of 1.3 feet, at which range it could lift a radiator.

## - MYTH -

Radiation around a microwave oven can destroy data.

## - TRUTH -

Cassettes were warmed inside a microwave oven without causing loss of data. So don't worry about highway radar ..unless you are speeding.

## - MYTH -

Nuclear radiation can erase media.

## - TRUTH -

Gamma rays four times a lethal dose did no damage to the data. Worry about yourself - not the diskettes.

The overwhelming conclusion is that, apart from the physical damage which can be produced by heat, abrasion or dirt, magnetic media are subject to harm from one source only - extremely close contact to any magnet. At very close range, even the smallest magnet can destroy a tape or diskette, but a mere inch of isolation provides safety for the data. Our advice should therefore be...keep tapes and diskettes inches away from all magnets, such as transformers, speakers, compasses, motors, and the graphics tablet.

documentation, n. What passes for humor in the computer industry. A transcript of Saturday Night Live as hosted by Torquemada.

fax, n. The ultimate in retrograde technology. Using thousands of dollars worth of equipment, a hand-written note can be scanned, digitized, transmitted and finally reproduced as ... a handwritten note! The high tech response to the postage stamp.

font, n. Loosely, a typeface or family of typefaces. A bitmapped font is one that displays a typeface on the screen of the computer. Typefaces for laser printers, which must be kept in the Blessed System Folder, are known as baptismal fonts.

hairline, n. A very thin line or rule. A hairline that extends into the margins of the page is said to recede.

Helvetica, n. The Wonder bread of typesetting.

interface, n. 1. The look and feel of a software program as determined by lawsuit. 2. An attempt to connect two devices that cannot and should not be connected in defiance of God, man and the manufacturers.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The Loop chapter has this strange habit of keeping our President, David Owens, on his toes. In fact, I don't believe he has really relaxed since he started to organize and arrange METCOM. So this month was really no surprise to see David explaining the ins and outs of Hard Disk drives.

The first item of business however, was to vote for the new

MCCC officers. Their names should appear elsewhere in the newsletter. Next on the agenda was the "putting forward" of names for the chapter officers. This was a disappointing state of affairs because no members volunteered their services to help run the chapter. So the Loop chapter has the same names on its Officer list as last year. However, he added cunningly, if you would like to put yourself forward for a position then give David a call. I am positive he will help you decide which position would be right for you and also explain the various functions and responsibilities that go along with them.

The Question and Answer period this month took on its usual life, with members asking questions from printers to flicker-fixers and High-Density floppies to CD-ROM drives. V2.10 was discussed regarding the difference between it and AmigaDOS V2.04. (The difference is that Commodore added CrossDOS and the Locale library. See - you should have been here!!!). The new A1200 was also discussed

and speculation was rampant regarding the price of this unit and also where in the marketplace it was aimed.

The presentation for this month as mentioned above was given by David Owens on Hard disks for your AMIGA.

gifts for your Amiga at the December Loop meeting. We hope to see you there...and remember, if you would like to be more active in the AmigaBy-The-Loop Chapter, then give David Owens a call.

David started by displaying a dissected 3.5 inch SCSI Hard Drive (Harold Williams' old drive, if memory serves me right). This gave those of us present a look at the arrangement and functionality of disks and heads found inside modern Hard Disk drives. Next, he explained how to hook up a SCSI drive to the system using the standard 50-line ribbon cable and mounting the drive in the drive bay on David's A2000.

Partitioning and Formatting were next for David's expert dissection. He carefully led us through the tricky path of partitioning a drive and then formatting it so that AmigaDOS recognized that it was present. He explained about Rigid Disk Blocks (A Commodore term) and AutoBooting (another Commodore term) - all the while answering a battery of questions concerning the use of members' own drives and setups.

The most asked question was: "How do I know if my drive AutoParks its heads?" The answer is... (See, you should have been there.)

David concluded a very thorough presentation with the use of some Hard Disk Backup Utilities. Most notable was QuarterBack V5.0.2 from Central Coast Software.

Incidentally the answer to the most asked question is "Check the manufacturer's documentation. Failing that, come to the Loop meeting and ask someone there!!!"

Amiga-By-The-Loop would like to extend our thanks to David for his excellent presentation on the ins and outs of Hard Drives.

Christmas is getting closer, so you may get some great ideas for

## Amiga West

Ben Clingerman

At the November Amiga West meeting our topic of the month was Amiga games. Everyone brought the games he or she liked, to show how the games played. Many old games surfaced that I personally had never seen. There's something innocent in those old shoot'em-ups as compared to Lemmings or the new Tom Landry Football that attracts my attention. Let's face it folks, we all were wowed as to how that Amiga was letting people play arcade quality video games in their own homes when we first discovered the Amiga in our local store. Brigade Commander, Lemmings, Wings, Hot Rod, and on and on we in attendance.

Eddie Monjay demonstrated Sunrize Industries' Studio 16 Board also. The AD1012, as it is called, is a monophonic digital sampler that allows you to sample at an amazing 80 mhz on your Amiga from any external sound source such as microphone, RCA jack, CD, etc. What is amazing about this is that your compact disks only sample and play around 40 to 44 mhz. Eddie sampled from CD to his 88 meg Syquest a song off of the new Wilsons CD. He then played it back to us and other than the playback being monophonic, there was absolutely no difference in sound quality. Now Sunrize is fixing to release the AD1016 board which has stereo input and output at the 80 mhz speed. This board will be even better for those who want to record music digitally. You have full mixing power on all of the AD boards...4 channel on the AD1016 and 4 on the AD516

which runs at a slower sampling rate. The AD1016, as I understand it, will handle 8 channel mixing to allow full use of the new Amiga 4000, 4000 Tower, 1200, and the Amiga 4300 which you will be hearing about in the near future. This AD1012 board would be excellent for Toaster or videophiles since the sound need not be stereo for your productions. If you require stereo sampling, Id suggest waiting on the AD1016.

We also made nominations for new officers this month and all of the previous officers were renominated. Voting will be at the next Amiga West meeting. If you would like to vote or would even want to run for office then come by and join us.

Have an Amiga day!

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Our November meeting marked another anniversary in our chapter's life: thanks to all who come and help us grow. In our tidbytes section, we heard about a neat Toaster segment on the Discovery Channel from Brett Hester. There was the usual discussion of New Stuff that Doesn't Work, and a Holiday Alert to watch for "playable previews" (demos) of new games coming out for Christmas. Danny Barnett told us that the Dallas Video Festival had featured some music and art videos showing off the Amiga's stuff, including an impressive "Theology" animation by Todd Rundgren and John Sanborn. Then he played a sound sample he claimed was the Voice of the Amiga, claiming the soul of Todd Rundgren, Mac user and growing Amigaphile. (The Amiga supposedly intoned " ...You are now Mine!!! Bwah-ha-ha-ha.!) He also said the Amiga's talents would be showcased at the Central Texas Amiga Computer Society's show, and offered a couple of tickets to same. We heard a whimper from the back

of the room, begging that Library Requests be made by Disk Name, not the file you were looking for! Then we all voted to accept the Club Officers as nominated, and nominations were made for our chapter officers for next year. If no other nominations are made before the election next month, our slate will include Danny Barnett for President, and Brett Hester, myself, Gus Reiter, and William Dockendorf returning as V.P., Secretary, Treasurer, and Librarian. (Aw, come on, don't any of you want to try your hand at this?)

We were still celebrating Tool Manager in our shareware spotlight, striving for a respeakable $50 or so group contribution to express our appreciation. John Chang offered a $10 challenge: if we raised $10, he'd match it! Of course, we did, and he did, and we met our goal. Have we started a trend? Thanks, John! We heard a report from Rusty of Metropolitan Computers that the A4000s are rushing in and out the door. Then came our "surprise guest"

Rusty presented to us the new A1200, nicknamed the "Poor Man's 4000", or "The affordable double-A chip machine" , or maybe the "stretched-out 600". The model we saw was a prototype (screws optional), brought to us courtesy of Microbotics. The "real thing" is expected out in December, and Metropolitan is already taking orders. We may be the only group in Texas to get a sneak preview of this system, which will come with 3.0 AmigaDOS and with or without a 2.5" hard disk. The A1200 has the new AGA (that's Advanced Graphics Architecture, folks!) chip set, and can do neat things like support 256 colors on Workbench, a long way up from the 16 we have now. The official Suggested List Price will be $699 without disk, $999 with (probably) 40 mb drive. (By the way, DPAINT 4.5 is expected to come out soon, supporting the AGA features and allowing 256,000 colors to choose from. Wow!)

Microbotics is working on a math coprocessor and memoryexpander board, tentatively labeled the "MBX1200" ", which will greatly speed up ray-tracing and other mathintensive processes. We thank them for sharing the very latest with us!

Rusty also introduced the "A570", an A500 peripheral that adds the CDTV capability to your A500, cheaper than buying a new CDTV. Hmmm. Hey, Santa, have I been that good?

Our Software Demo was John Chang's presentation of ImageFX, by GVP. (Hey, did you know that stands for Great Valley Products? Now you do.) The box says it's a "Full Color Image Processing System", and that kinda says it all. It has a lot of great features: scanner support, a morphing program, a paint program (24-bit cut &amp; paste, brushes, fills, etc.), assorted printing capabilities, frame grabbing, color separation, an "antique effect" , over 25 file formats handled, ARexx and C language support..all for list price of $319. (Art Department Professional can do this and more but it adds up to $6-700.) By the time you read this, the AGA module will be out, available as an upgrade if you already own ImageFX, and supporting all the AGA special capabilities. Great product, John!

Our Door Prizes were awarded to Randy Edwards (Multimedia FX), William Dockendorf (Amiga Professional Tutor Series Vol. 1), and Jack Jeter (AD&amp;D Treasure of the Savage Frontier). Next meeting: Party Time! December is our traditional Games Month, and we have 7 Amigas coming at last count. Bring yours!..and your favorite games, and party munchies to share! (Be sure to bring all the power cords, plug bars, cables, etc. you need.) This will be our official Christmas Party for the year, and a good time should be had by all. We also plan to have a "flea market", for software swapping, but it will be the "you watch it yourself" format. Bring along your outgrown or unneeded stuff and make somebody's Christmas shopping easy! Happy Holidays, Y'all!

John Burt presented two disks from our club library. Disk #534 had a program called HAL system (Home Application Loader). This program has several options such as Letterwriter, Halculator (calculator), Bank Accounts, Home Inventory, Calendar, and our favorite, Shopping List. The second disk we viewed was #416, Printer Pictures. This program prints pictures using various keyboard characters. We printed pictures of JFK, Mr. Spock (Star Trek), and the statue of David.

We would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to the MCCC members who previously attended the HEB Chapter meetings to attend our meetings. Everybody is always welcome - we need all the support we can get!!

Remember! Chapter officers for 1993 will be elected at the December meeting - please attend and be a part of the transition team to help get 1993 off to a Great Start! We'll see you on December 12 at 1:30 pm, in Room 506 at TCOM.
