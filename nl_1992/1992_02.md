## PageStream 2.2

## The waiting is over by Bill Raecke

1 order 1 ruder how. But abor el and t's been a long time since we began seeing the ads for wonder if it would ever show. But show it did. And true to form, this upgrade was sent automatically to all registered users at NO CHARGE. Say what you will, there is no other software company that offers that kind of support, period.

amount. Clicking on it is the same as selecting the "Show/Set User Scale" menu item from the View menu. The other new gadget is the Magnifier tool. Select the tool, then click on a spot on the document. The magnification level will be doubled, centered on the point where you clicked. Using the shift key will halve the magnification level.

This review will not be a full review of PageStream. We covered most of the program in the recent six-month series of articles I did on the subject. All I will do this month is touch on some of the more important changes. Of course this means little to those who already own PageStream — if you are an owner you already have the latest version. But if you haven't yet made the plunge, perhaps this will give you more reason to do so.

The first thing you will notice is the new look. PageStream has embraced the AmigaDOS 2.0 look. The screen colors are the standard gray, black, white and blue and all the gadgets and requesters have the "shadows" that look so sharp.

The second thing you will probably notice is the new toolbox. Aside from the new look, there are several tools missing and a couple of new ones added. What Soft-Logik has done is simplify the interface while adding new features. Quite a trick. The way it was done is by using the shift key. There is no longer a need to have a separate gadget for circles and ellipses. Just a single gadget is used — and if you need a true circle, simply hold the shift key while drawing and that's what you will get. The same shift key method is used to draw a true square, a vertical or horizontal line, or even a square text column. In fact, the line draw function even has a totally new capability drawing lines at a 45 degree angle. (The shift key allows only vertical, horizontal, or 45 degree angled lines.) There are two new gadgets added to replace those which were eliminated. There is a View Tool just below the drawing tools which shows the current magnification

There are many minor improvements. You can now (finally) double-click on a file name, a font, or just about anything to make a selection. Also, the font requester in version 2.1 and prior had a nasty habit of sorting the list of fonts just before it was displayed each time. With a large font directory this became quite time-consuming. Version 2.2 sorts the fonts just once — when the available fonts are updated. From then on the display of the font requester is instantaneous. The Rotation gadget has been improved so that it is easier to tell what the result will be on the object. And it is now possible to re-size a rotated object successfully. Most gadgets have been improved so they are easier than ever to understand and use.

ut all these improvements — though they are much easier — are just the frosting on the cake. There are two major improvements in this version of PageStream. The first is speed. PageStream 2.2 is fast when it comes to displaying text. I ran some comparisons just to get an idea of the speed increase. The tests are by no means comprehensive — some fonts seem to be sped up more than others — but this will give you a feel for the improvement. Remember that these tests were run on my Amiga 2000 equipped with a GVP 28mhz accelerator. Your results will vary. The times shown represent the time it took for PageStream to display my font sample page using the different fonts listed below. Note that there is considerable difference when bit-mapped screen fonts are used for the display. → Page 4

There is also a major improvement in the time it takes to prepare a page for printing. On a typical page from this newsletter (page 7 in fact), PageStream 2.1 took 35 seconds before starting to print the page. PageStream 2.2 reduced the wait to just 9 seconds.

The other major improvement comes by way of the new HotLinks, PageLiner and BME companion products. I don't have these yet so I will refrain from a full explanation. Suffice it to say that PageLiner is a text editor, BME is a picture editor, and HotLinks is a program that connects them all together so that (for example) a picture can be edited on the fly without saving to disk, loading into Deluxe Paint, changing, saving to disk again, re-importing, re-sizing, and re-positioning. Look for a full review on these three products next month.

So much for the good news. I have a small amount of bad news te report as well. It has to do with color selection. By default, as I mentioned earlier, PageStream uses AmigaDOS 2.0 colors. Part of that includes a black on gray screen for the borders, requesters and gadgets, and a black on white display for the document itself. It looks beautiful as long as you have an Amiga 3000 or a de. interlacer of some kind. But if you are one of those unlucky souls who uses a standard interlaced display, the black on white will jitter so badly your monitor is likely to jump off the desk. Of course, you can adjust the screen colors, right? The answer is both yes and no. You can adjust them just fine — but the wrong combination is likely to result in a display where the "paper" and "ink" are the same color. Makes it rather difficult to read. It seems that PageStream attempts to use some amount of logic when displaying colors on the screen - and it does a poor job of it. To get rid of the white "paper" simply change the white to a color that is not quite white. When you do this and then cause the screen to refresh, you will notice that the "paper" color is now gray — just like the borders, requesters and toolbox... the old "white" color is no longer used for that purpose. If that is good enough, all will be well, but changing other screen colors will cause still different colors to be used for the "paper" and "ink". I'm sure that there is some logic to the choices... but I'm not sure what it is. All I know is that coming up with a legible combination other than the default is largely a matter of trial and error... and patience.

But that seems to be all the bad news there is. In all it's one heck of an update. I

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

Mohar lad by do lear. Is there anyone who remembers Lode Runner? Is there anyone who DOESN'T remember Lode Runner? Lode Runner was a very popular game about seven years ago on just about every computer imaginable. But then the Amiga came out - and Lode Runner was never ported over. There are those of us (me) who have been waiting ever since for a Lode Runner style game to play on the Amiga. I finally have my wish fulfilled with Mother Lode. Even better news - it's not a commercial program, but a shareware release — so it's cheap.

For the uninitiated, I'd better explain a little about the game. Mother Lode is a classic "run and jump" game - without the jumping. Your character is faced with a series of platforms with ladders and overhead bars to connect them. The mission is to collect the yellow boxes on the screen and then make it to the top of the screen. To make the job difficult, there are robots chasing you. If you come into contact with one of them you lose a life. Your only protection against robots is your fleetness of foot and your ability to dig holes. Dig a hole and a robot will fall into it. He won't stay for long until he manages to extricate himself, but while he is there you may use his head as a stepping stone without danger. Just as the robots won't stay in the holes you dig forever, likewise the holes themselves won't stay forever. They will fill in after a period of time. If a robot is in a hole when it fills back in, he will perish — but another will reappear somewhere at the top of the screen to take his place. You may also dig holes as a means of travel. You may fall through from one level to the next though a hole you have dug. Of course, if you fall into a hole at the bottom of the screen you will be stuck there until the hole refills and you lose a life. To make things even more complicated, there are some places where you can't dig a hole. And there are still more places where it appears as though there is solid ground but where, in fact, there is a trap door.

I don't know how interesting this all sounds but believe me, this game is habit-forming. If you're looking for a way to lose a great deal of sleep, this is for you. Mother Lode is released with 50 levels. If you send in your requested shareware donation of $15, you will be sent a level editor with which to expand the game. You

## The Tax Survival Kit by Harv Harris

The Tax Survival Kit is available once again in the club library. If you're planning on turning in an Income Tax return this year, you probably need to check this out. If you're not planning on filing... please renew your membership before you leave on that extended vacation. The Tax Survival Kit is NOT public domain and it is NOT shareware. It is a commercial product. It is purchased by the MCCC with a license agreement that allows us to redistribute it to any member of the club. As a member, you are allowed to use it freely BUT you may not redistribute it to any non-member. That means it may not be given to friends and it may not be posted on bulletin boards. Treat it as you would any other piece of commercial software. It's just one more reason to be a member of the club.

What The Tax Survival Kit does is make it easy to fill out your forms. All the calculations are done for you, and totals are carried from form to form automatically. When everything is done, the results may be printed out directly on the pre-printed tax forms and turned in. Included are Form 1040; Schedules A, B, C, D, E, F, and SE; and Forms 2106, 2441, and 3903. That should take care of most people's needs.

## Postscript and PageStream Fonts

If there's one thing we have plenty of this month, it's new fonts for use with PageStream. In all there are 37 new fonts that appear on MCCC-A\_367, MCCC-A\_368 and MCCC-A 369. Some of my favorites? Look for a new version of Black Chancery, now done in Postscript format, that appears on MCCC-A\_367. The old one was a SoftLogik format font that was already one of my favorites. This one has been cleaned up somewhat so that it looks even better - especially at small point sizes. Another interesting one on that same disk is called PostCrypt that would be especially nice around Halloween. On MCCC-A\_368 is an interesting display font with big, round letters called BeesWax — and another with tall, squared off letters and interesting descenders called Farquharson Free, Starburst, from MCCC-A\_369 is a very flashy display font when you need something particularly attention-getting. /

## AmigaDOS 2.0

A look at what's new by Harold Williams he January Amiga-By-The-Loop meeting featured new Amiga 2.0 operating system. After Johnny completed his talk, David Johnson (Ansoft Data Systems) demonstrated the 2.0 installation procedure using my 2000. He installed a new 2.0 Kickstart ROM and then ran the installation procedure to update my Workbench. The process took less than 30 minutes. Now I have spent a couple of weeks learning about the new operating system. I am really impressed.

The documentation is incredible. The 2.0 upgrade comes with two manuals. The small "Getting Started" manual contains the information you need to install 2.0, a list of the changes from the 1.3 operating system, and a "trouble shooting" section to help solve potential problems. The main manual ("Using The System Software") is a massive book consisting of almost a thousand pages of documentation. This book covers virtually every feature of 2.0 and does it very well. There are three main sections to the book covering Workbench, AmigaDOS, and AREXX. The Workbehch section starts with an introduction to the Amiga system and detailed reference to all the features of Workbench. Preferences is covered in a separate chapter, and all of the programs included in the Tools and Utilities drawers are discussed. The last chapter in the Workbench section covers the use of a hard drive. The AmigaDOS section begins with an explanation of the Amiga file system, Shell, and scripts. The following chapters include a complete reference to all the AmigaDOS commands and instructions for using the three text editors (ED, EDI and MEmacs). The AREXX section covers the Amiga version of Rexx, a programming language that specializes in interprocess communication. The manual concludes with an appendices, glossary and index.

The look of Workbench has changed. Windows, icons and gadgets have a 3-D look. The default system colors have changed, the pointer is different (especially the wait pointer, it is now a clock) and even the Topaz font has changed. Functionally, Workbench is very different. All the Workbench menus have changed, although all the old menu items are still there. Things are just rearranged and renamed. The new menu titles are "Workbench", "Window" ', "Icons" , and "Tools". The new organization makes a lot more sense. There are also several new items on the menus. The Workbench menu includes two new items named "Backdrop" and "Execute Command". "Backdrop" toggles between placing Workbench on a screen (like 1.3) or in a Window (the default for 2.0). "Execute Command" displays a requester for an AmigaDOS command. The Window menu has new items named "New Drawer", "Open Parent", , "Update", "Select Contents", "Show" and "View By". "New Drawer" creates a new drawer in the selected window removing the need for the old Empty drawer. "Open Parent" opens the window of the parent of the current window. "Update" causes Workbench to redraw the selected window and correctly display changes to the icons that have ocurred outside of Workbench. Under 1.3 this could only be done by closing and then reopening the window. "Select Contents" is a quick way to select all the icons in a window. The new "Show" menu item offers sub-items named "Only Icons" and "All Files". "Only Icons" is the default and functions like 1.3 to display icons for all appropriate info files. The "All Files" option will cause an icon image to be displayed for all files in the drawer that do not have info files. The "View By" option offers four sub-items named "Icons", "Name Date", and "Size". The

The main manual ("Using The System Software") covers virtually every feature of 2.0 and does it very well. The new Workbench menus place most of the power of the CLI within the reach of the Workbench user.

"Icon" option is the default and displays the standard Amiga window with icons. The other three options change the window to a text display of the files sequenced by either name, date or size. The "Window" menu includes two old items that are significantly improved. The "Clean Up" option really works! Large icons and icons with long names are handled correctly. The "Snapshot" option now includes sub-items named "Window" and "All". The "Window" item will snapshot the position and size of the window as well as the "Show" and "View By" modes. The "All" item snapshots the window and all the window's icons. The "Icons" menu has several old options and three new ones. The "Unsnapshot" option removes the icons position information to allow Workbench to place the icon anywhere within the window. The "Leave Out" option will cause an icon to remain on the Workbench window even if you reboot. The "Put Away" option reverses the action of "Leave Out" and moves an icon back to its original drawer. The "Tools" menu is designed to allow application software to add items that would allow you to run the application from the menu. The new menus make Workbench much easier to use and place most of the

power of the CLI within the reach of the Workbench user.

Workbench has a new feature that simplifies the addition of utility programs to the startup procedure. There is a new drawer named "WBStartup" '. Placing a Workbench application in this drawer causes it to be automatically executed at the end of the startup procedure. This makes it very easy to have programs like screen blankers, clocks, directory utilities, etc. running without modifying a startup script.

Preferences has been expanded to offer even more customization of the Workbench environment. Preferences has been broken down into separate editor modules. All the old features are still present, but now there is also control over the screen mode (up to 16 colors and screens of all sizes), the system font (any size), overscan, and background patterns for Workbench and

Perhaps the most significant addition to the Amiga operating system is the inclusion of ARexx. ARexx has been available for a long time as an independent product, but now it will be an expected part of the operating system. This should cause more and more software to support the use of ARexx.

The FastFileSystem has also been improved. The FastFileSystem was used primarily on hard drives under 1.3, but now is easily used on floppies. The improvements are related to both speed and reliability.

The Amiga Shell has also been improved. The Shell now has a close gadget. The sizing gadget is not destructive. If the Shell is resized the text will flow back into the window. Changing directories has been simplified. The Shell now supports an implied CD. The AmigaDOS commands have been rewritten to provide greater flexibility. There are also several new commands.

There are several new tools in the Tools and Utilities drawers, including a hard drive backup program, a utility named Colors that will let you control the colors of any application, a picture display program, a much improved icon editor, a screen blanker and several more.

The list of changes and enhancements goes on forever.

I'm going to mention two more small, but wonderful, features of 2.0. The Workbench copy function has a neat new feature. We have always been able to grab a drawer and drag it to a window to make a copy. Now you can grab a disk and drag it to an open window. Workbench will create a drawer with the disk name and then copy the contents of the disk to the new drawer. This is a terrific way to copy the entire contents of a floppy to your hard drive. And now last, but certainly not least, Workbench now supports a feature known as an AppEvent. An AppEvent is created when an icon is dropped on a tool. If the tool recognizes the icon as an appropriate object, the tool will immediately act on the object. For example, dropping an icon on IconEdit, the new icon editor, will cause the icon to appear in the edit window.

Amiga system software release version 2.0 is well worth the $100 price. It is currently available at all the local dealers.

## Pocket Writer

The Premiere C128 Word Processor by Jim Lutter — The Fresno User Group

Pocketons and 128/64 is a product of Digital Solutions and a member of the Pocket Series which also includes Pocket Planner and Pocket Filer. Pocket Writer is one of the better word processing prorams written for the Commodore. Version 3 is the latest and has a few new features. Earlier versions of this program were known as Paperback Writer and were equally good at the time when they emerged.

Pocket Writer 128 is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) word processor. What you type on the screen is what you get when you print it out. If you type bold, italics, subscript, superscript or underlining, on the screen it actually appears that way. There are no hidden commands or codes which signify these text formats. As long as your printer is capable of printing these features they will print out as they are on the screen.

PW 128 has superb 80 column graphics and is capable of being configured to autoboot with all your individual preferences. You can configure screen colors, printer drivers, foreign characters, disk drives, etc. drivers are provided for most major printers but are simple to create using the codes from your manual.

Pocket Writer 128 is capable of using a RAM expander, 2045 blocks of storage with the 1750, as an additional disk drive. It is capable of handling a string of 10 disk drives. The entire program takes up approximately 64K in your 128's memory, allowing enough for nearly 30 pages of data. Files may be linked together on a disk, allowing for ample memory.

Perhaps the second greatest feature after WYSIWYG is the on-screen help. There is almost no need for the manual after the tutorial is mastered. All document formatting commands are found by hitting f5. All text formatting is found under f7, and the HELP key. If additional help is needed, it can be found by hitting HELP a second time and the definition of specific commands are available.

Line for line text formatting is another great feature with the ability to change margins, pitch, centering, etc. on a line for line basis. With the use of a mouse in port 1 there are pull-down menus available much like those on other brand computers. Transferring of files from other word processors is possible, and there is a feature allowing for a dual memory with which you can work on two documents at the same time. It is also possible to create form letters using any sequential file of addresses and information and merging them together. Pocket Writer 128 comes with a 32,000 word expandable spellchecker which runs rather slowly.

Pocket Writer 128 is far above most word processors and runs a close second only to the top of the line most recent programs available today. Version 3 is available through most mail order companies and sells for around $44.

## Amiga By-The-loop Pete Goad

Our January meeting was held, as usual, at the North Richland Hills Community Center. Over 40 attendees created parking spaces and waded through a muddy, partially renovated parking lot to reach the evening's activities.

smoothly due to David's expertise at V2.0 installations. Harold then proceeded to re-configure his system running under V2.0. Although I have yet to upgrade my system to V2.0, based on the evening's presentations, anyone who has yet to upgrade needs to find $99.00 and go get a copy!

The evening started off with a Video showing the new Toaster 2.0 capabilities. This is one impressive demonstration of AMIGA video power. Performed to a hard-hitting drum rhythm, it showed off the versatility of NewTek's hardwaresoftware package. You have to see it to believe it. Thanks to ANSOFT's David Johnson for the video.

The program presentation for January was a two-pronged attack on AmigaDOS V2.0. The first prong was from the software side. Johnny Kitchens started with an overview of the new operating system using Ned Kelly's A2000 machine. (Thanks Ned) Johnny went through the new Preferences, explaining the new screen modes, screen setups, etc. He then proceeded to generate some GIANT fonts to show how V2.0 handles and can generate them. He then fielded many questions from the awed crowd and finally returned Ned's machine in almost the same configuration as it started!!

The second prong was from the hardware side. David Johnson of ANSOFT Data Systems proceeded to perform open heart surgery on Harold Williams' A2000 machine (Thanks Harold) and replace the V1.3 ROM with the new V2.0 ROM. It was a masterful display and when power was re-applied... lo, it booted fine! David then proceeded to load up the AmigaDOS V2.0 floppy disks onto Harold's Hardframe controlled Hard Disk. (Harold had already backed up the disk). When all the disks were loaded a reboot was in order. The process went very

Thanks again to Johnny, David (ANSOFT), Ned and Harold for the presentations and use of their machines. The Loop Chapter hopes to see you at our next meeting.

The door prize was an ANSOFT Tee-shirt courtesy of (yes, you guessed it) ANSOFT Data Systems. The prize was won by Robert Womble.

## Amiga Central Ray Howard

Our new president Harold Williams started the first meeting of the year with a 45 minutes of lively questions from the audience. Also, Scott Lamb mentioned that Commodore was the only personal computer manufacturer in the U.S. to post a profit for 1991. Several questions were asked and answered by members about upgrading and installing 2.0. Some "must have" utilities for 2.0 that were mentioned are ARQ, AssignX, and ToolManager. These programs and others are available on the BBS and the library. A fortune cookie in 2.0 was also mentioned. It is in the 2000/500 version for certain. To see the secret messages you must hold down the Ctri key and the right/left shift and alt keys while making any WB menu selection. Then use the normal selection method to pick the Last Message entry from the WorkBench menu. If this is done before any WB windows are opened you will see a secret message in the WB screen title bar. A second cookie in 2.0 is on the Install2.0 disk in the WB distribution. To see it one opens the

Tools drawer on the Install2.0 diskette and selects "Show All Files" from the Window WB menu. Then use the window scroll gadget to move to the right and open the drawer named Test. This drawer contains a giant icon with the names and signatures of major contributors for 2.0. This is not all the secrets in 2.0 -more will be revealed next month at the Amiga Central meeting.

The main topic of the night was setup and use of a hard drive moderated by Harold Williams. Harold discussed advanced hard drive topics including partitioning, buffers, automount, autoboot, and Rigid Disk Blocks. Harold discussed many advantages to creating partitions on a hard drive. One is that it is easier to recover from file system errors (i.e. the old dreaded R/W error on DHO:), because less will be lost if only one partition is corrupted. Backups are more manageable as one can place system software and applications on one or more partitions. They do not need to be backed up unless major changes are made, such as updating to a new version of DPaint or ProWrite. Data can be placed on a separate partition and backed up on a frequent schedule. This scheme uses less diskettes and time than a complete backup of the drive. Another advantage of partitions is being able to organize your drive into sections containing related programs and/or data. A separate partition for games decreases the chance of a small child delete or moving important data or programs to unexpected places. Harold also recommended that the number of diskbuffers for a partition be equal to the number of blocks per track for the drive. This will allow the computer to read a complete track of data at one time, improving drive access speed. The differences in the FFS in 2.0 from the one in 1.3 was discussed. If your hard drive uses Rigid Disk Blocks and was used under 1.3 you need to update the file

## CHAPTER NEWS

system in the Rigid Disk Block to use the new 2.0 FFS after making a full backup of the partition and installing 2.0.

For the February meeting we will be turning our attention to telecommunications. Just as January was "everything you ever wanted to know about hard drives" February will be "everything you wanted to know about telecommunications" · You'll not want to miss it. See you there.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

CDTV to choose from, running the Lemmings Christmas Demo, Sim City, Populous, Lotus Turbo Challenge, Dinosaur Discovery Kit, Star Trek, GODS, Leander, and more... everything from great PD to the very latest just-arrived games Forrest brought. It was great to just mill around and sample hardware, software and munchware (well, what else would you call cookies?), and I think everyone had a good time. Metropolitan sent us door prizes from Santa... Dragonscape, Space School Simulator, and Tetra Quest. A great end to a good year!

Happy New Year!!! No, I didn't have any chapter notes last month, as our December meeting came after the deadline and January plans were still under deyelopment. But we had a party worth mentioning in December! Several folks brought munchies and there were over 40 people in attendance (with a sprinkling of kids for sparkle), busy Christmas schedules and all. We had the usual rumor-swapping, with lots of tidbytes from Forrest Mckinney... stop by Metropolitan and ask him what's new! The Edge's team couldn't make it, but sent Seasons Greetings and a promise to be with us next time. Danny White (our elusive V.P.) actually got to come to this one, and ran things until the long-absent world traveler Craig Bird arrived, home from Sweden and happy to close one last meeting as President. We did make our 1992 officers official: Henry Ribron as President, Brett Hester as V.P., me again as note-taker, Gus Reiter as Treasurer, and William Dockendorf returning as librarian. Thanks to all those whose willingness to serve has made our chapter the biggest and busiest around! We had no formal demo (as planned), just a bunch of happy Amigas playing everyone's favorite diversions. We had three A1000s, an A500, two A2500s, and a

Our January meeting was wellrun by our new officers. We heard about some virtual reality video games, and had a reported sighting of an A3000 Tower (it will ALMOST hold a toaster...). We were told that Mike Weaver is our new Commodore Rep coming to the DFW area as a permanent connection for Texas and Oklahoma. Image World, a computer graphics, animation, and multimedia fair, was announced, coming to InfoMart Feb. 18-20. (Watch for Sony, Newtek, and The Edge and Lone Star Video among the participants.) Seen For Sale: the CDTV Professional package, which includes a disk drive, an infra-red mouse, a keyboard, some software and a manual, for much less than the combined price individually. Brett Hester says the paint was rubbing off the 2000-like keyboard, but maybe they won't all be like that. Don't forget his Toaster SIG! We hear The Edge now has a special MCCC area on their BBS. Leave a message to gain access info, if interested. Back in the corner, Brett's self-serve CDTV fish market was set up, running Expressfish and Aquarium and offering do-it-yourself access to Fred Fish disks 1-530. Just stick in your blank floppy and tell it which one you want and out it comes. Very User Friendly! Remember the left mouse button switches we got, a while back? We still have some, if your button's broke. Ask the officers. In the library: The Tax Survival Kit (purchased by the MCCC and available to MCCC members only), plus 20 new Fish disks. Got any requests, suggestions, ideas, etc. for either meeting topics, demos, or classes you would like to see scheduled? We have a suggestion jar by the anonymous questions and doorprizes jars, and we'll be delighted to hear from you. (Or call!)

Forrest McKinney provided our January demo, presenting the highlights of the 2.0 operating system. Now that it's available for the 500, 2000, and 3000 (just $99 to upgrade), many of us are curious as to what improvements it has to offer. (By the way, our dealers will install the upgrade for you for a reasonable fee... if you do it yourself, you zap your warranty.) The 2.0 package comes with a "10 pound" manual (how many pages is that?), which is reputedly well written. We had a whirlwind tour of many neat features: "instant CLI" command windows, temporary icons for files created iconless, system hot keys, multiple sets of preferences (for multi-user households!), fancy colors and window sizes, and loads of PD stuff designed to make the most of the new capabilities. I was fascinated to hear about a "degrader" program that supposedly turns off things here and there so maybe that old software can run after all. Apparently most serious (non-game) software is now compatible with 2.0, but ask your dealer for specifics. The actual 2.0 software installation apparently goes very smoothly: "They really paid attention with this one" , said Forrest, and the documentation is "Very nice" ". Much of the 2.0 PD software is available on our BBS, as well as Forrest's own BBS, "The Amiga Connection" ", 5302215. There are also on-line games and all kinds of new and current stuff, available 24 hours a day (except when his Amiga is visiting

## CHAPTER NEWS

us, of course), free except for access to the Fred Fish collection ($15/year). Thanks for letting us in, Forrest, and for a great presentation!

Last and never least: Doorprizes! From Metropolitan, Pygnosis' Nitro and Sublogic's Jet. From The Edge, 2 copies of Blockout (YES, it's addicting. Somebody take this thing OFF our machine!), and 2 ACE magazines. In February we have interesting demo topics presently pending confirmation, so come and be surprised, or check with the officers closer to the meeting date. We DO hope to see a couple of new Eric Schwartz animations, always a lot of fun. RIGHT NOW, turn this thing over and check your expiration date on the mailing label. Oh, you're reading someone else's? Well, sign up and get your own! (You are always welcome at meetings, member or not, but there are so many goodies with membership that it's worth the $24!)

## Arl/Grand Prairie Brad Dumler

The Arlington/Grand Prairie chapter got the new year going with a change in officers at the January meeting. Most of the evening was spent in a help-question-discussion session where everyone participated Possible topics for future programs were discussed. Also mentioned was the suggestion of foregoing a Tuesday evening meeting and instead taking a group road trip to Infomart in Dallas on a Super-Saturday to get together with the folks in SCOPE.

Thanks to the forthcoming visit from the IRS tax person, in February we will take a quick look at the latest Tax Survival program that is available to MCCC members. Suggestions for other programs are invited. Foster McCowan, the new leader of the chapter, encourages everyone to contribute to the chapter and the club by attending meetings regularly, participating in program presentations, bringing hardware or software to use or talk about, sharing PD and shareware programs with our library and BBS, and submitting articles for the newsletter. If you are having any problems with your system, come to our meeting or workshop for some assistance. We hope to see you in February at the Grand Prairie Public Library.

## Fort Worth Mary Louise Hagemeyer

The Fort Worth Chapter had a good meeting in January, with several members demonstrating programs and others offering questions and comments. John Burt said that he had accidentally scratched a disk file that he needed, but after searching through the DOS literature he was able to retrieve the file by using Virtual Directory and Edit Track and Sector. Just two bytes had to be changed on the disk to recover the file. John demonstrated some programs he got from Q-Link: WorldClock and Mah Jongg.

John Burt has found a good way to recycle old programs and computer books. He brings them to the meetings and offers them as door prizes. This time the program was GORE, won by Jack Hagemeyer.

Bob Hoskins demonstrated some C128 programs ranging all the way from Bible Clues to Helltown. James Dunnam discussed hexadecimal numbers and showed how to use the monitor program in the C128 to look through memory.

If you have a program you'd like to talk about, either an old favorite or a new discovery, bring it to the February meeting. There may be some Little Computer People on hand, and we'll surely talk about tax preparation programs. The meeting is on February 8 at 1:30 p.m. at the West Berry Church of Christ, 2701 West Berry. We'll see you there!

## H.E.B. Robyn Wilson

As you already have seen in the newsletter, the officers for 1992 are as follows: I have taken on the offices of President and Secretary. The Vice President is Carol Cappa, Treasurer is Jesse Carden, and Librarian is Bill Worthington. We all are working to make a great year for those interested in the C64/128.

At the January meeting, music was one of the topics covered. There was also an introduction to the library and other help sessions.

The February and March meetings will be held at Jesse Carden's house. It is located at 5309 Jerri Lane in Haltom City. From the Hurst area, get on 820 going West and exit Denton Highway. Turn left and go through two set of lights (Glenview and Stanley-Keller). Jerri Lane is before the next set of lights (Broadway). Turn right on Jerri Lane. Go through one stop sign. The house is on the right, before the next stop sign. His phone number is 8389530 if you need further help. The meetings will return to the Hurst Recreation Center in April.

At the February meeting, the BASIC programming language will be discussed. JiffyDos and the Dos Wedge will also be reviewed in length. If any of this cannot be discussed within the meeting time, it may be carried over to the next meeting. Of course you can ask any question anytime.

At the March meeting, because of the special location of the meeting, we can hold a discussion about bulletin boards. This includes the new MCCC BBS and Startext. In the future meetings, we will learn how to set up a C64 and C128 (and maybe an Amiga). There are also databases, word processors, copy programs and any other subjects of interest. Please let me or any other officers know what you want.
