## Proper Grammar

## At last I can stop making so many dumb mistakes by Bill Raecke

M onth after month it's the same thing. I write and edit the articles that go into this newsletter. I proofread each of them three or four times. Then, a month later, I'll be glancing through one of the articles and notice a big, glaring error staring up at me. How could this have happened?! The answer is obvious to anyone who has tried to edit a document: to some extent we all read what we expect to read. No-one reads every word on the page. Our eyes skip over the unimportant parts of a sentence and our mind fills in the blanks. But that doesn't stop the frustration when I spot an error that I should have caught before it got into print.

Softwood Incorporated may have just provided the answer to my problem. They have recently released a product called Proper Grammar. Now Proper Grammar is not "hot off the presses". It's been out for a few months now, and if you keep up with the major magazines you have probably already read about it. But, if you're like me, you take those articles with a grain of salt. (How many bad reviews have you ever seen?) That being the case, I felt it was appropriate that I give my "un-biased" opinion - or at least as un-biased as I ever get - now that I have purchased it for my very own.

Let's start at the beginning. Proper Grammar is distributed on two disks. It can be run off floppies (although it will be necessarily slow) or it can be easily installed on a hard drive. The installation procedure for hard drives is as easy as it gets. On the "program" disk is a drawer containing Proper Grammar and a few sample documents. You simply pick up the drawer and drop it wherever you want on your hard drive. Then you take the other disk, find the drawer on it called "CTFiles" ", and drop it into the Proper Grammar drawer that you just copied onto your hard drive. There is no other installation procedure required - and the program is totally unprotected. There are many other software companies who could take a lesson or two.

Proper Grammar gives you a choice of display options.

You may have it come up on the Workbench, on a custom non-interlaced screen or on a custom interlaced screen or it will ask you to choose at startup time if you like. When run in interlaced mode, Proper Grammar uses a custom font that gives a beautiful display on an Amiga 3000 or when a FlickerFixer or Display Enhancer is installed on a 2000. On a standard Amiga 500 or 2000, the non-interlaced display will be your best bet. Proper Grammar's display is divided into three sections. The top section is where brief error messages will appear as your document is verified. The section below contains space for longer messages and spelling alternatives. The large area at the bottom is where the document itself is displayed. Just above the document area is a row of command buttons where you control the editing of the document.

Ready to start checking a document? Fire up Proper Grammar, select "Open" from the Project menu, and load in your document. Proper Grammar will read documents that were created in Word Perfect, ProWrite, Quick Write, Pen Pal, excellence!, Scribble!, KindWords, TextCraft Plus, TransWrite, and standard ASCII. And it will re-write the corrected document out in the same format - or in another format if desired. Just one word of warning... not all format codes are retained for Word Perfect. But Proper Grammar does warn you of the fact and it tells you which codes they are.

To begin the document check, click on the "Check" button. The program will proceed through the document until it reaches the first questionable word or phrase at which time it will highlight it and put an explanation of why it is has stopped in the top section or the top two sections of the display. Time out to talk about what Proper Grammar is checking. First, it is a spell checker. The dictionary contains more than 135,000 words - more than 99% of the words used in normal writing. But it's more than a spell checker. It can report when you forget to capitalize a word. And it can tell when you have transposed letters in a word. For example, one of my

common mistakes is to type "form" when I meant to type "from". A simple spell checker won't catch the error because "form" is a perfectly acceptable word. But Proper Grammar knows the usage of words and can tell that there has been a misspelling based on how it has been used in the sentence. Some of the other things it can spot include punctuation errors, the omission of words, grammatical errors, disagreement between subjects and verbs, redundancies, and lack of continuity. From the manual: "Each word in the sentence is examined for spelling errors. Then the entire sentence is broken down to identify parts of speech, inflectional forms, and syntactic relationships. All of this occurs in milliseconds." Sound neat? It is! And bear in mind that nothing is corrected automatically. You can by-pass any error and you can even "permanently" mask out errors if they are part of your writing style. For example, it is technically incorrect to begin a sentence with "and" or "but". But it can lead to a more relaxed style so, if you want, you can tell Proper Grammar not to bug you about it. Of course, anything turned off can always be turned back on - either temporarily or permanently.

Let's say that Proper Grammar has just stopped at the word "FlickerFixer". In the top section the message states, "The word 'FlickerFixer' is not in Main or User Dictionary." At this point four of the control buttons are available. "Continue" will simply by-pass the "error" and continue with the process. "Ignore" will mask out this word as an error. "Suggest" will bring up possible correct words from the dictionary (in this case there are none). And the button marked "Add" will add the word to your own, custom dictionary. The dictionary will even remember the correct capitalization rules.

In another example, the program stopped where I had written the sentence (above): "There are a lot of other software companies who could take a lesson or two." The phrase "a lot of" was highlighted. The message in the top section said "Vague quantifier. Be more specific or try 'much', 'many', or 'a great deal of'". The three choices were listed below. I highlighted the word "many" and clicked on the "Replace" button to correct the sentence. For many possible errors, there is an "Explain" option which, if selected, brings up a lengthy explanation of the rule in question complete with examples of proper usage.

This is what the Proper Grammar screen looks like. Here it has found a phrase that could be clarified. In the top window is a brief description of the problem. Below that is a more detailed explanation. By clicking on the EXPLAIN option, even more help is available.

Most corrections can be accomplished with just the click of the mouse button. Others require you to type or correct a word or phrase (when a specific or suitable option is not provided by the program). For more complicated editing, standard word-processing tools are provided (cut, copy and paste) so that corrections can easily be accomplished without exiting the program.

There is one other program function that I should mention - the "Document Statistics" function. By selecting "Statistics" from the "Project" menu, an analysis of your document is performed which shows:

- Number of paragraphs and average number of sentences per paragraph - to help gear the paragraph style to the audience.
- Total number of sentences, average word length, number of simple sentences, number of complex sentences, percentage of passive sentences - to help make writing more interesting. There should be a variety of sentence types and a minimum of passive sentences.
- Number of words and average syllables per word.
- Number of simplex and complex noun/verb groups.
- Readability scores including: the Flesch Reading Ease Score and Grade Level, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Gunning's Fog Index. If you're interested, this article rated 67.89 on the Flesch Reading Ease Score which qualifies as "Standard"; grade level 8.21 (7th - 8th grade) on the Plesch Reading Ease Grade Level; 7.37 on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level; and 9.51 on Gunning's Fog Index (indicating that a ninth grader could understand it.

That's about it. The program is remarkably easy to use. It comes with a large, detailed manual which, because of its size, looks complicated, but which is very easy to get through. Proper Grammar is fast and effective and keeps me from making dumb mistakes. If you do any writing this program will prove invaluable. EVERYONE going to school needs it. I just wish I had something like it I could run on my IBM at work. It would be REALLY nice to stop making dumb mistakes there.

These are the statistics for this article. Proper Grammar calculates such things as the number of paragraphs and the number of sentences per paragraph; the number of words and the number of syllables per word; and then goes on to such things as readability scores.

## VidSIG Review

The First Two Years by Jack DeTore idSIG was born January 1990. A few people in the Metroplex wanted to get ready for the world of popular multimedia communications spawned by Commodore with the video and multi-tasking co-processor based Amiga computer. NewTek's success with the DigiView system for digitizing 4096-color pictures on the Amiga provided the resources (brains and money) to embark on an unbelievably ambitious and audacious video effects system called the "Video Toaster". Commodore was moving into higher-end capability with plans for the 32-bit bus Model 3000 and provision for easy upgrades to the 68040 CPU. Optional A-Max II plus and Bridgeboard cards add a Mac and an IBM PC into the same case. Operating system and software base growth pointed to near term capabilities that other brands are now planning to provide but in a different world of price. Clearly, people who wanted to DO something about the applications of computer to video projects warranted a user group regardless of equipment brand. Interest existed among users of IBM, MacIntosh, as well as Amiga computers. Video equipment covered several brands, formats, levels of required expertise, and budget. So what was the common denominator? Answer: People who wanted to "do it better". The Metroplex Commodore Computer Club encourages special interest groups led by its members and provides freedom to operate independently of the chapter organization. This was a natural combination for VidSIG. (Several ViSIG members switched to Amigas once they saw how it helped them and joined MCCC.)

Here's a list of meetings VidSIG has held so far:

1. 02/19/90 - Joint meeting with Society of Film and Video Artists at UTA.
3. 09/22/90 - Saturday meeting, video editing with the Mediaphile system. Dry run for METCOM*90 VidSIG room.
2. 04/27/90 - Demos of: AutoCad to Sculpt animations, genlocking, CanDo, late news of A3000.
4. 01/26/91 - Saturday meeting. Two Toasters, many cameras, editing mixers, VCRs, TBCs, etc.
5. 04/25/91 - Video lighting, SteadyCam Jr.
7. 06/27/91 - Single frame recording Sony EVO 9700.
6. 05/23/91 - Video titling, Toaster effects, HAM Video.
8. 09/26/91 - Making CDTV software; CDTV demo.
9. 11/26/91 - Basic waveform monitoring; non-linear video editing systems; report on the 1991 Dallas Video Festival; new local 24-bit color printing service announced by a VidSIG member.

Some observations about the last two years:

- The first meeting was launched in January 1990 with 12 members.
- By the last meeting, the VidSIG membership had quadrupled to 48.
- The number of meetings per year doubled from 3 to 6. (Remember that several meetings involved a logistic trail of equipment being set up and checked out before a demo could be successful.)
- More members joined or rejoined at the VidSIG table during METCOM*91 than were in the group in the first
- A Toaster SIG was initiated by a VidSIG member.
- We lived within our means. (Read this: We ended this first two years with more in the kitty than when we started. See Chuck Johnson for details).
- The group contains talented people who have joined in various special projects or enterprises for income.
- Some projections about where we're headed:
- The ebb and flow of new hardware and software will be mastered by the kind of members that are VidSIG... but other concerns about product will emerge.
- Teamwork will bring VidSIG members together (again) producing "quality" in videos. Outside awards and recognition will follow.
- Special techniques and effects will be mastered by the kind of members that are VidSIG... but other concerns about product will emerge.
- Having earned a reputation for "quality", », VidSIG will be able to sponsor awards in the Metroplex for what its judges believe to be excellence in the fields of video arts and science.

The first two years have seen growth because VidSIG members are concerned about ways to "do it better"; in other words they are concerned about quality.

Best wishes to you all for the New Year/

Now that a new year is beginning, it's time for others to take the lead in making VidSIG go. Please continue to give them your support. Thank you all for the opportunity to be a part of this "startup". Thank you, SimuFlite, for helping us to launch with your generous offer of the use of a quality facility. Even though I won't be on the VidSIG steering committee this coming year I certainly plan to continue as a member!

## Oh No! More Lemmings

## They're back... and they're getting into more trouble

by Bill Raecke arly in 1991 we were all introduced to a game „different from any that had come before. And we all spent untold hours trying to save our little friends from the various fates that awaited them when we weren't clever enough or quick enough. Lemmings, from Psygnosis, made it to the top of everyone's best games list. And then we all finished the game (or gave up when the going got too tough) and were left with nothing to keep us

up late. Oh No! More Lemmings to the rescue.

For the few who may have never played the original (I would guess that would include new Amiga owners) I will quickly review the basic game play. Lemmings will start falling onto your game landscape from a trapdoor in the sky. They begin marching toward the right. If they encounter an obstacle they will turn around. If they walk off a cliff or fall into water or encounter a trap or fall prey to any of the other various fates that the diabolical game designers have been able to invent, they will die. Your mission is to guide them safely through the level to the exit that appears somewhere on the landscape. To do this you endow the lemmings of your choosing with various attributes that will allow them to prepare a path for their comrades. You can give lemmings the ability to climb, to float (downward, using an umbrella as a parachute), to block, to build brides, or to dig (either horizontally, diagonally or down). The problem is, on any particular level you will have a limited number of those attributes to pass around - and you may not have some of the attributes available at all. The other problem is, while you are preparing a safe passage, they will be walking to their doom. You must find a way to protect them until the way has been cleared.

Oh No! More Lemmings doesn't offer anything new. It simply provides 100 new landscapes to navigate successfully. There are five difficulty levels: Tame,

![Image](1992_01_artifacts/image_000007_cb9f55603b135fc4783c2a8af04e2217a4c02e3983435f06c447ae24e066da06.png)

mings does not pick up where Lemmings left off (thank goodness). It is set up much like the original - beginning with some very simple layouts and getting progressively more difficult. The music is new - and seems to be more varied than the

original.

Oh No! More Lemmings is available in two versions: a stand alone version and an add-on version that requires the original Lemmings to play. If you have the original Lemmings you may want to save some money and opt for the add-on version. That's what I did. Here's how it works. You boot with the new disk. After a short while you will be asked to insert Disk 1 from the original Lemmings into any drive and press the mouse button to continue. If you follow the instructions, the game will NOT load. What you really have to do is remove the Oh No! More Lemmings disk from drive 0 and insert Disk 1 from the original Lemmings into that drive. If you have a second drive you may insert the Oh No! More Lemmings disk into it at this time. Then when you press the mouse button everything will work just fine. That's the only problem I have encountered.

My recommendation is probably unnecessary. Those of you who have the original know it is one of the best and most addicting games ever. But for those who don't, let me just say that if you don't get this game you're missing out on a lot of fun. No library is complete without Lemmings. And now, no library is complete without Oh No! More Lemmings. Say goodbye to a good night's sleep.

## EDGE Now Sells Fleas???

No, we're not really selling fleas, but we are having our second Flea Market at the Addison location. On January 18, 1992, we will be offering our customers the chance to use our tacilities as a central clearing house. If the last Flea Market was any indication, this is an event you don't want to miss.

This is a great opportunity for users with software and hardware they no longer want or need, to turn that excess stuff into spendable EDGE credits. It's also an unbeatable chance to pick up some great deals on equipment you've been wanting, but thought you couldn't afford. Now, both sides can get together, and everyone will be happy.

The way it works is this: you bring in what you want to sell. Be sure that your name, phone number, and how much you want for the item are clearly printed either on the item, or on a piece of paper attached to it. We handle the rest! When someone buys your item, you then have a choice; an EDGE Certificate worth what you sold your item for, or a check for the value less 10 percent. The certificate is the same as cash at either EDGE Computer and Video Location. All Items must be at the Addison store by January 17.

So whether you want to be a buyer or a seller (or both!!), plan now to attend the Second EDGE Flea Market, Saturday January 18th all day. A good time will be had by all!

"The Grand Experiment Is Over." After three months of offering Sunday hours, we have determined that they are NOT what the buying public wants. Consequently, beginning January 1, 1992, both Edge Computer and Video locations will be closed on both Sundays and Mondays. Also, the store's hours will return to their pre-Christmas times of 11 AM to 7 PM. To those who did utilize our Sunday hours, we apologize for our inability to continue that particular service.

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

M ultiDOS by Kjell H. Didriksen You've probably heard of Cross-DOS (a commercial product) and MSH (also known as MessyDOS from the club library). This is another program that accomplishes about the same thing. Like the others, it allows you to read or write IBM format disks on your standard Amiga floppy drives. in how you access the drives. With the other products, if you put an Amiga disk in a drive you must access it with the standard name DFx:

spider that is a must for any collection of objects. And on MCCC-A\_360 is an object called RobotCop2 - another must have.

## Christmas Lemmings by Psygnosis

![Image](1992_01_artifacts/image_000012_50dd52c75d4735562e2933f3b8bd82f38b597cea768515898b3783156dd83f38.png)

It's just a short little demo, but it's kept me busy for many hours so far. It's fully playable. I've gotten through the first three screens but I'm still stuck on the fourth. If you'd like a taste of Lemmings before you plunk your money down - or if you'd just like a few extra levels with that special taste of Christmas to add to your collection - this is just what you need. It's fun... and it's on MCCC-A\_363.

the drive), and if you put an IBM disk in a drive you must access it with the name DIx: or some other name. With MultiDOS you can simply use the standard Amiga device name (DFx:) and access either standard Amiga disks or IBM format disks. Although I don't have a great need to access IBM format drives on my

Amiga, I have tried it and it seems to work like a charm. Give it a try. It's on MCCC-A 357.

## ClipArt

It's another good month for clipart. On MCCC-A\_357 is a large collection of IFF clips for Christmas plus a few other miscellaneous clips in EPS format. It might be a little late for Christmas this year, but there's always next year to prepare for. And on MCCC-A 358 you'll find a lot more... all in EPS format - various subjects. This is all really top quality stuff. Be sure to check it out.

## Imagine Objects

What would a month be like without some new objects for Imagine? This month there is a Klingon warship available on MCC.C-A \_358 called WarBird. It's very beautifully done, with a great amount of detail. On MCCC-A\_359 is a beautiful robotic

Also on MCCC-A\_363 is another excellent game. This one is called Crazy Pipes. It's along the lines of Pipe Dream. You are given sections of pipes - corners, straight sections in various directions, and crosses - that you need to piece together in such a way as to keep the liquid flowing through them as long as possible. You need to achieve a minimum length to continue to the next level. It's not as easy as it sounds since the pipe sections provided to you are seldom what you need next. It's a very well done game. Well worth getting.

## The Sound of Silence

Amiga 2000 Stealth Fan instructions by Glenn Nielsen (UseNet)

ired of listening to that Jet Engine Turbine fan on up with that cuts the fan noise down by at least half. Over the course of the last six months, the noise of my Amiga 2000 fan slowly increased as the bearings for the fan started to make more and more noise. Since my warranty was out, I decided to go ahead and pull the power supply and check out the fan. To my surprise, when the fan was separated from the power supply and held by hand, it was almost whisper quiet, except for the noise the bad bearings generated. But when mounted in the power supply, the noise was terrible. Drawing on my experience in the Submarine Navy, I realized that it was a simple problem of sound isolation. The fan had been popriveted onto the aluminum case for the power supply. This direct metal to metal contact allowed the noise vibrations to transfer from the fan to the power supply, and from there to the rest of the Amiga case, amplifying the sound generated by the fan.

The solution? Well, I went to the local hardware store and bought four 1/8" X 1" round headed bolts with nuts and lock washers and four round rubber grommets with a 1/16" slot for the power supply casing and a 18" hole for the screws. These parts should only cost a couple of dollars.

Now, installation. First turn the 2000 off and unplug the power cord from the rear. Next, remove the 5 phillips head screws holding the cover on, and remove the cover. (There is one screw in the top middle of the back, and 2 screws on the bottom of the cover on each side.) Next

## Demon Possesses Computer

According to a tabloid journal that ameless, c a Peruvian newspaper is reporting that a bank computer was intected with a virus that spawned a demon.

You read that right. A horned demon appeared on the screen, shocking one bank worker so badly, she died of a heart attack. Another bank employee was decapitated. LEd. - Gotta fix that disk-ejection spring! Vo one else can get near the machine, as everyone who tries runs away screaming. [Ed. - Sounds like a DOS problem to me: Demon On Screen.]

## Quantum Announces New Hard Drives

Quantum Corp. has announced four removable hard disk drives that it claims will offer over a 40 percent increase in actual performance, a 300 percent increase in usable capacity and a 400 percent increase in reliability.

Quantum is claiming effective access times as fast as 9 milliseconds, seek times as low as 17 ms and a sustained data transfer rate of over 1.4 megabits per second.

remove the 2 screws on the back of the 2000 for the power supply. One is located at the top on the inside edge of the fan - the other is at the top, just above the power cord connection. Now remove the 2 screws that mount the power supply to the metal mounting bracket for the power supply and drives. These screws are at the front of the power supply next to the protective cage. Now, unplug any power supply cords coming from the power supply to the motherboard and disk drives. You should be able to remove the power supply now. OK, now to remove the fan, use a 1/8" or 5/32" drill bit and drill to drill out the rivets connecting the fan to the power supply. Next you need to drill out the fan mounting holes on the power supply to accommodate the rubber grommets. The grommets I used required a 5/16" hole. Now install the grommets and mount the fan using the 4 bolts, lock washers and screws. I found it was easiest to install the bolt at the bottom right corner of the fan first (looking from the rear of the power supply). Tighten the screws until snug, but don't overtighten. One last item. You should trim any of the rubber grommet sticking out on the side of the fan cover plate so that the power supply can fit snugly against the rear of the 2000. That's it! Now just re-install the power supply and the 2000's cover.

## JiffyDos 6.01

## by Sean Peck

from the newsletter of the Pittsburgh Commodore Group here has been a lot of hoopla over this product by since I purchased mine early this summer, I can see why.

The JiffyDos base package consists of 2 ROM chips for the 64 version, (1 for your computer and 1 for your drive); and 3 chips for the 128 version, (1 for the computer in 64 mode, 1 for 128 mode, and 1 drive chip). The 64 version sells for $59.95 and the 128 version sells for $69.95. If you have more than 1 drive you must purchase a drive ROM for each additional drive if you want to be able to use the faster loading from those drives. They sell for $39.95 each. The package will also include instructions on how to install JiffyDos into your computer and disk drives, and a 50 page user's manual.

simply type $ for a directory. There is no need to save what you are working on so that you can load a directory into memory. $ is nondestructive. One command I find the most useful is one I wish Commodore would have put into its OS. It is called TLOAD; the format is tload"filename. This command is basically the DOS Type command, so it displays the file. You can read the docs to that program you downloaded without needing to load up a seq file reader! There are many more commands as well.

The installation instructions are EXCELLENT! I had

Jiffy Dos does have a few limitations you should know before running out to purchase it, because if you have 2 drives like me it is about $100 worth of investment. JiffyDos does not improve 128 mode disk activity very much, since the 128 already has much faster drive speeds than the 64 - but the 64 speed improvements basically

## Thought

## for the Month

In our civilization, and under our republican form of government, intellegence is so highly honored that it is rewarded by exception from the cares of office.

no problems whatsoever following them. You need no special tools to install JiffyDos; just a screwdriver (possiblyra torque screwdriver for 128's) and a flathead screwdriver to pry the ROM chips out of their sockets so you can put the fiftyDos in. However, because of the small amount of room in the drives, it did make for some very strange and awkward angles trying to pry the chips out. Purchasing an IC remover would not be a bad investment, but I did accomplish the feat with a flathead screwdriver.

Jiffy Dos will not only allow faster drive speeds, but to insure compatibility with copy protected software it includes a toggle switch to switch

JiffyDos on and off. And the drive ROM replacement chips include the latest versions of Commodore ROMs on them as well! So if you have some of the earlier 71's with relative file programs etc, JiffyDos will end these problems as well. JiffyDos requires no extra cables, and is not a cartridge, so you can still use your REU or favorite cartridge without any problems.

JiffyDos also puts the DOS Wedge into your computer - you can accomplish disk commands without the need to know the open commands. From a new line you can investment if you cannot stand waiting for things to load, or do extensive disk accessing.

make its disk speeds slightly faster than a 71/128 combination, which is a vast improvement over 41 speed. Also, if you are a GEOS user, and are hoping JiffyDos will improve your drive access time while in GEOS, sorry guys, doesn't work that way. JiffyDos replaces the Kernel ROM routines, and since GEOS has its own fastloading routines and does not use the kernel routines to load, they will not be improved at all. This problem could be overcome with a software hack to GEOS, but I guess we get to thank Berkley once again for releasing a copy protected OS. This product is excellent, it does EVERYTHING it claims, and is well worth the

## Understanding Your AMIGA

Converting JPEG to an Amiga file format by Harold Williams

![Image](1992_01_artifacts/image_000015_2e3b57522399111bf3fed27b8785c18206d564f69a70c66db08a60c4260939c7.png)

ecently the Amiga community has been introduced 'unusual in that it is a "lossy" compression scheme. Other compression routines (like those used in ARC, ZOO, and LHARC) are designed to un-compress with no loss of data. JPEG is specifically designed for full color (or gray scale) picture files and is not designed to preserve the picture data, but rather to preserve the picture image. The remarkable thing about JPEG is that the compression can be dramatic and the picture image is still retained, although some of the original data is lost.

always huge. This means that a standard Amiga 500 or Amiga 2000 just can't handle this conversion, because neither the RAM device, nor the floppy drive can store the PPM file.

Although, DJPEG has a couple of optional parameters I haven't found them to be very useful. You might want to experiment with the g and -D options. Entering -g forces the output file to gray scale, and the -D option tells DJPEG to use Floyd-Steinberg dithering. Here is the command to produce a grey-scale PPM file.

DJPEG -g DFO:Haxold.jpg RAM:Harold.ppm

Note that the -g option is lowercase and the -D option is uppercase.

WASP has a bazillion options, many of which are very useful. The -asc option will auto-scale the image to fit the Amiga screen. There are a couple of options to scale the picture including -x alb, -y alb. These two will scale the image in the horizontal and vertical directions by the ratio alb. There are options to flip the image horizontally (-xmirror), vertically (-ymirror) or on a diagonal (-transpose). Options for forcing a specific IFF format include -hires (16 colors), -lores (32 colors), -ham (4096 colors), -ehb (64 colors), -sliced (sliced HAM), - dyn (dynamic hires), -lace and -nolace. You can also specify a direct RGB file using -rgb n to create n bitplanes. So, you can create a 24 bit IFF file with-rgb 24. There is really a lot to experiment with here. You might try the following command to produce a HAM picture that is scaled by 50% horizontally and displayed in interlace (the equivalent of scaling by 50% vertically but without the loss of vertical resolution).

WASP -ham -lace -x 1/2 RAM:Harold.ppm DF1: Harold. ham

You can create a 24 bit IFF file with this command:

WASP - Igb 24 RAM: Harold.ppm DF1 :Harold.iff24

This last example produces a file with the maximum picture data. If you intend to process the picture further, this is the best option.

![Image](1992_01_artifacts/image_000016_a824e45917de407de480d3a7f7f1e7471417d29f8f039e929b3d50ae7c8dfd71.png)

If these utilities seem difficult to use there is another option. The Art Department Professional v2.0 from ASDG will process JPEG files (and virtually anything else) and convert them to any Amiga format.

In order to view a JPE Ged file on your Amiga it must be converted to an Amiga picture format. The are currently three utilities available from the MCCC club library (and BBS) to help with this process. DJPEG will un-compress a JPEGed file into either a PPM or GIF file. PPMto24 will convert PPM files to IFF 24 bit files. WASP will convert PPM or GIF files to virtually any of the Amiga IFF formats. I have had the best results using a combination of DJPEG and WASP. You should place these utilities in your C: directory or in some other directory that is found in your system command path. The following two commands (entered on the dreaded CLI) would un-compress a JPEGed picture named Harold.jpg stored on drive DFO: to an IFF picture named Harold.iff on drive DF1:.

DJPEG DFO:Harold.jpg RAM:Harold.ppm WASP RAM:Harold.ppm DF1:Harold.iff

A couple of things you should be aware of:

1) the DJPEG command will typically take about 10 minutes to complete the conversion to PPM format and

2) the resulting PPM file is typically about 1 megabyte in size.

This means that first you should be very patient (or get a 68030) and second you need more than 1 megabyte of RAM to follow the above example. If you don't have several megabytes of RAM, then substitute your hard drive name for the location of the PPM file. What? No hard drive? If you don't have either a large amount of RAM or a large storage device, like a hard drive, you are basically out of luck. JPEG files are typically 30K to 80K in size and the resulting IFF files are also typically in the 100K to 200K size, but the intermediate PPM file is

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Garry Wordelman

Yes, Amiga West still exists. Lately you haven't seen anything from the Amiga West Chapter in the Newsletter, and I'm sorry you haven't been informed as to what has been happening. I have been unable to attend meetings for the past seven months due to being transferred to second shift at work. My apologies to all.

This month's turn-out was meager due to Christmas and all. Those that did attend agreed that we are committed to making this Chapter the best of any - and why not? Our meeting facilities at The College of Osteopathic Medicine are fantastic. Take an amphitheater setting, 260, table desk seating, break-room with video games, patrolled parking, and you can't go wrong. This is a great place to hold our meetings. I personally would like to thank the Osteopathic College for letting us use their auditorium.

This month was the last month that our Vice President John Belyeu will be with us. John is moving on due to the Carswell AFB closing. Also, our Librarian, Fred Sagor, may be re-locating due to General Dynamics' cut backs. We at Amiga West, and I'm sure at all chapters, are sad to be losing such outstanding members from our group. Good luck, John and Fred, in both your and your families' lives.

This month's feature speaker was, of all people, ME. My demonstration was of the shareware program MED 3.1 and of the program stereo Master, both music related programs for the Amiga.

MED 3.1 is available to you on our own MCCC BBS. This program was designed by Teijo Kinnunen from Finland. The software has the look and features of a high-end commercial program that you'd expect to pay well over $100.00 for.

You have all the Midi capabilities, sample modification, waveform analysis, clip, paste, multi-tracking, transposing - the list goes on and on. This is no wimpy program people! It will blow the doors off the mainstream software that is available. All my accolades aside, the program does have one major drawback: it will not accept IFF song files from any other music program other than itself or Soundtracker. It also does not score sheet music or save songs so that Sonix or Deluxe Music Construction Kit will recognize them.

Stereo Master is a softwarehardware combination that allows you to grab sound from a microphone or any electronic media via an adapter that plugs into the printer port. Then, standard mini headphone-style cables are used to plug into the sound source to obtain your desired sample. Monophonic samples can be captured from 3.0 59.6 KHz. Stereo samples can be captured from 3.0 - 14.4 KHz. The higher the sampling speed the greater the quality. stereo Master has a built in sequencer, spectrum analyzer, and 3D fast fourier display that allows you to see your samples in a 3D graphic display. It also has twin oscilloscopes and a host of effects such as phase shifting, echo, pitch-up, pitch-down, chorus, reverb, ramping, stereo pan, pitch bend, and reverse playback. I hooked it up thru my Sony Disc-man and home stereo to demonstrate the effects. It cost $49.00 at Wedgewood Rental.

Everyone's invited to come to our meetings the second Thursday of each month. I'm looking for great things with this New Year of '92.

Dorothy Gates

Our December meeting was enhanced by a "Demonstration in Ingenuity" so the program of charming Christmas graphics and Christmas music could go on. Hershel used a Gemsoft Disk, keyboard by Mark Dickenson with stereo symphony cartridge with six voices and three voices. Although the audience was small due to busy Christmas activities, the presentation was much appreciated. Eddie Allen will be missed as our meeting conflicts with his new programmer's club meeting night but he expects to show up for the Saturday workshops.

Officers elected were: Vice President Foster McCowan, Treasurer-Secretary-Reporter Brad Dumler and Librarian Glen Herring, with the office of President still to be nominated.

The next meeting date is January 14, 1992 at the Grand Prairie Library and the workshop will take place January 11 at the same location. We have a good time in the workshops and we invite you to come join us and see if we can help you with Commodore problems.

Happy New Year folks - and may the new year be even better than this one.

## Fort Worth Julia Sookma

The newsletter went to press before our December meeting so I am unable to report on last month's meeting. However, I can report that we will be meeting on January 11, 1:30 pm at West Berry Church of Christ, located at 2701 West Berry. Make plans to be at our next meeting and help us get the new year off to a GREAT start!
