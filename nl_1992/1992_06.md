## Outline Fonts

et's start at the beginning. If you have upgraded L care at he or are compus are outined Fonts. If you are working off a floppy you may not have installed them (they are optional) but you have them nonetheless. Does everyone know what an "outline" font is? The normal Amiga Fonts are bitmapped fonts. What that means is that the characters in the font are stored as a dot pattern'which can be directly transferred to the screen. Outline fonts are stored as a set of mathematical descriptions that describe each character as a series of lines and curves. The advantage to this method of describing a font is that it can be infinitely sized. Lines and curves can be expanded or compressed to virtually any point size desired. This means that only one font description needs to be stored to handle an infinite number of sizes — rather than the bitmapped method which requires a separate description for every size available.

Workbench &amp; PageStream - Things your manuals don't tell you by Bill Raecke the font sizes don't work all that well at these low resolutions. A 15 point Compugraphic font on the screen will be as clear as a 3 point font printed on a HP Deskjet or a laser printer... although considerably larger. (This newsletter is printed with a 9 point text font.) The apin was.

There is one way to approve the appearance of an outline font. If you look on page 7 of Appendix D in your "Using the System Software" manual that came with AmigaOS 2.0, you will see reference to an environment variable called Diskfont. In this file you can adjust the ratio of the width to the height of the font. By default, the aspect ratio is 1:1. The environment variable allows you to specify the XDPI and the YDPI (DPI means Dots Per Inch). The default setting is "XDPI 100 YDPI 100." By decreasing the YDPI setting, you expand the width of the font. In other words, if you change the setting to "XDPI 100 YDPI 50," the resulting font will be twice as wide relative to the height (which will remain constant at the specified point size). You will also find that it becomes much more legible although at twice the width you won't get many characters per line. You may play with the settings to see what looks best. Any value for YDPI is OK. Just a couple of more comments. Whatever setting you choose will be used for all outline fonts... the setting has nothing whatever to do with the Fountain program even though that is where the explanation of the environment variable can be found. Also, you will have to re-boot to see the effects of your changes. And finally, don't save the variable to ENV:SYS/Diskfont. I know that's what the book says... but since ENV: is in RAM:, your changes won't survive a reboot there. Save it instead to ENVARC:SYS/Diskfont.

utline Fonts in Workbench and PageStream Some of you may have noticed that the outline fonts included with Workbench are Compugraphic fonts. You may have also noticed if you are a PageStream user that PageStream duplicates the Workbench fonts.

This all sounds great - and it is up to a point - but the reality is somewhat less impressive than the theory... at least so far as Workbench is concerned. The promise of outline fonts is that you can get jaggie-free fonts at any point size. And you do — at larger point sizes. But at normal text sizes — the sizes you are likely to use on the Workbench — what you get are ugly fonts. Part of that is due to the relatively low resolution of the Workbench screen and part is due to the way AmigaOS handles the fonts. If you are printing a 15 point outline font using a good desktop publishing package to something like a HP Deskjet or a laser printer, your 15 point font will actually be made up of 62.5 vertical dots. (A point is 1/72 of an inch.) On the Workbench, a 15 point font will consist of only 15 vertical dots... at least that is the maximum that it could be. In practice, AmigaOS always leaves one blank pixel above and one blank pixel below the tallest and lowest characters in the font respectively, which means that your 15 point font is actually only made up of 13 vertical dots. The mathematical routines used to calculate

Times and Triumvirate are included with Workbench and with PageStream resulting in a waste of precious disk space. If you make the additional Compugraphic fonts that are supplied with PageStream available to the system, there is even more wasted space because each of them will be duplicated as well. And if you have purchased additional fonts (as I have) the situation becomes even worse. Wouldn't it be nice if AmigaOS and PageStream could both use the same fonts? Well, guess what? They can! And it's not difficult to do either. Of course the standard disclaimers apply. Make sure you have plenty of disk space before you start (enough empty space to hold all your Compugraphic fonts) and make sure

## Workbench and PageStream can be set up to use the SAME Compugraphic fonts.

you have a backup of things the way they were to start with in case things get somehow messed up. If you manage to lose something, I'm not responsible. But I can assure you that I used this procedure myself and it works. I didn't encounter any problems.

Now you're ready to convert your PageStream Compugraphic fonts. First you must correct your Fonts:

The first thing to do is decide where you want to keep regular fonts drawer if you like... that's where they are by default. But if you are going to use all your Compugraphic fonts as Workbench fonts they will be taking up more space than before. You will probably want to keep them where your PageStream fonts are kept instead. For purposes of this discussion, I'm going to assume that you will keep them in a drawer and that you assign that drawer the device name of "CGFonts: " To do this just enter the command "ASSIGN CFonts: pathname" and add it to your user-startup file. Now look at the Fonts: device. In it you will find a drawer called "\_Bullet." In it is a file called "plugin.types." This file is a duplicate of the file called "Plugin. Typebucket" supplied with PageStream. Move the directory called "\_Bullet" to the CFonts: device, then find the "Plugin.Typebucket" file and delete it. Next, look for the directory in the Fonts: device called "\_Bullet\_Outlines." Move that directory to the CFonts: device. At this point you should delete the Times and Triumvirate fonts that can be found in the "Bullet\_Outlines" directory - the versions that come with PageStream are more complete. There are still more files to be dealt with. There is a pair of files that go with each Compugraphic font in the system. Look in the Fonts: device for file names ending in ".otag." There should be one " otag" file for each Compugraphic font and there should be a matching file ending in "font" as well. Delete the "otag" and the ".font" files that go with the Times and Triumvirate fonts. Move the files that go with the Letter Gothic font to the CFonts: device.

device so that Workbench and the Fountain program will know where to find the Compugraphic font information since you have moved it. To do this you need to use a little-known feature of AmigaOS 2.0... a single device can occupy two or more physical locations. To set this up, simply enter the command "ASSIGN FONTS: SYS:Fonts CGFonts:". Add the same command to your user-startup file for future use. The system will now know to look in two different locations for fonts. Now you can fire up Fountain. On the right side of the window will be a list of the fonts which are currently installed in SYS:Fonts. These should be all your bitmapped fonts. Click on the button marked "Fonts: Path Component #1." It should change to read "Fonts: Path Component #2" and it should show you the currently installed Compugraphic fonts... which at this point, if you have been following along, should be just the "Letter Gothic" font. To convert the rest of your fonts, look for the gadget on the left under the heading "Outline Font Source." Enter the path for the PageStream Compugraphic fonts. (The little folder gadget will bring up a standard file requester so you may simply click your way to the proper path.) Once you have the directory located, click on OK. The "Source Typefaces" window should show all the PageStream Compugraphic fonts found in that directory. Click on each of them and then click on the gadget at the bottom marked "Install Marked Typefaces." The program will work for a while. When it is finished, you should see all the Compugraphic fonts in the window on the right. Repeat the procedure for any other Compugraphic font drawers you may have. When you have finished you may delete all of your original PageStream Compugraphic fonts. (If you are using the PageStream screen fonts to speed up the display you can leave them there. They are the file names with the numbers. PageStream will still use them so long as they you make sure that the Font Manager knows where to find them.)

The only thing left to do is to go into PageStream's "Font Manager" and Delete or Update the drawers where the Compugraphic fonts used to be. Add two new entries: one for the CGFonts: Bullet drawer and one for the CGFonts:\_Bullet\_Outlines drawer. Make sure you also Delete or Update the directory where the "Plugin.Typebucket" file used to be if it was in a different place than the Compugraphic fonts themselves. What you have now is a system where all your Compugraphic fonts are recognized by the system and PageStream works just as well as ever. You may have also noticed that where there used to be three files for each Compugraphic font in PageStream, there is now just one. The truth is, those others were never used anyway... at least not since PageStream 2.0 was released.

Maybe you're wondering why I'm advocating making Compugraphic fonts available to the system when I just spent a great deal of time explaining why they aren't very good for Workbench fonts. The answer is simple. You can use them for things other than Workbench fonts. The latest version of Deluxe Paint IV (version 4.1 available from Electronic Arts) supports outline fonts - and other programs are likely to do so soon. They work great in large point sizes.

## Quarterback 5.0

Backups made smaller by Bill Raecke think most of us use Quarterback for our hard-drive released a new version, 5.0, of this popular program as a low cost upgrade. I purchased the upgrade and thought I should write a brief report of my experiences thus far. Let's cover the major modifications one by one.

The most noticeable change is the look of the program. Quarterback now looks like an Amiga program. More, it looks like an AmigaOS 2.0 program. This is a major change for Quarterback which, until now, had one of the worst looking user interfaces in the business. But, not only does it look better... it works better as well. For example — it is now possible to select or de-select a directory. Previous versions allowed the selection of files only. I have just one complaint about the new interface. When backing up to floppies with earlier versions, the program showed graphically where it was on the floppy. The new Quarterback doesn't do that. The result is that you must pay closer attention to avoid losing time as the program waits for you to swap disks.

The second big change is the addition of an ARexx port. This means that you can totally automate your backup process if you like. You can add up to ten ARexx programs to a menu and you can rename those menu items to whatever you like.

The third major change is the addition of tape support. As more of us get larger and larger hard drives, backup to floppy becomes a more painful process. It is slow — the process being limited by the speed of the floppies themselves — and the number of disks required for backup verges on the ridiculous. That means that as time goes on, more of us will want to avoid floppies and go to tape instead. Tapes are much faster and require much less space... most hold 150 megabytes per tape. I don't have a tape unit so I can't give a first-hand report, but the system is designed to work with any SCSI tape unit operating through any SCSI controller. A major plus is the ability to write multiple backups to a single tape. Most backup programs don't allow this. A drawback is the inability to backup a partition which overflows onto a second tape. Each backup must fit onto a single tape and it is up to the user to make sure it does.

The fourth major change is the ability to compress data as it is being written. This is something that interested me a great deal since I currently don't have a tape unit and my hard drive backups require 135 disks. Of course the big question is how the compression routines will affect backup time. It won't accomplish a lot if you save a few disks but it takes longer. To satisfy my curiosity I decided to run a few tests. First I need to explain that in Quarterback you have a choice of several compression options. You can choose 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16. bit compression. As the numbers get higher, the output will get smaller but the processing power required will increase... in other words the time required to perform a backup may increase. I never finished a backup in

![Image](1992_06_artifacts/image_000004_47378100db6c07af5d54ee5d354eb2d802fb51c4275cf5b875809c42bbcf6c26.png)

This is what Quarterback looks like when getting ready to backup a partition. All files and directories can be selected or deselected. To start the backup, simply press the Proceed button or the P key on the keyboard.

compression mode running with a 68000. I tried... but I ran out of patience. Suffice it to say that Quarterback's compression routines are extremely slow when running on a stock Amiga. You would do well to ignore the option. But on an accelerated machine, the floppy speed still turns out to be the inhibiting factor. The tests below were run on my Amiga 2000 equipped with a GVP 68030 accelerator running at 33 mhz and equipped with 8 megabytes of 32-bit RAM.

Compression Type

None

12-bit

16-bit

Backup Time

31 min

32 min

30 min

Comp-Results

27%

35%

It's interesting to note that the highest compression rate actually worked quicker than using no compression at all — and the resulting backup only occupied 13 disks rather than 19. The moral is — if you have an accelerator, use compression. If you have a stock Amiga, use the noncompressed backup option. It is just as fast on a 68000 as on a 68030. I also tried the compression routines on other partitions. As expected, the efficiency varies with the nature of the data being compressed. 35% turned out to be the greatest compression I experienced. The low was 19%. But even that is worth it since the backups are just as fast as when using no compression at all.

My opinion? Quarterback 5.0 is still the best backup program around — even more so now than before with the addition of several very powerful features. But it needs a little programming attention to add some speed to those compression routines. They should be useable on a standard Amiga.

This is the window where you may select from a set of backup options. Note that there are options for up to four floppies as well as a tape backup. The backup may even be stored as an AmigaDOS file if desired.

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

Screen banker for a I'm always on the lookout for new stuff to make my Workbench more interesting. This is a good month for that kind of thing. On MCCC-A\_404 this month are updates to two popular screen blankers for ore interestic C A. 40 shit AmigaOS 2.0. ASwarm III by Jake Rose is an upgrade to ASwarm II by Ilenseer and Matthias Scheler. This version has a number of new features in it, but the most noticeable is that fact that there are no predefined swarms any more. Instead, you specify a number of swarms and a total number of bees. The swarms then form themselves naturally using those numbers. In other words, if you specify two swarms and thirty bees, you won't necessarily get fifteen bees per swarm. You might have twenty bees in one swarm and just ten in the other. Then, when the swarms fly past each other, some of the bees may desert one swarm to join the other. The size of each swarm is constantly changing which makes it much more interesting to watch. Also included are new features such as a speed control (handy for slowing down accelerated' machines).

On that same disk is an update to Spliner by Tom Rokicki and Sebastiano Vigna. In case you haven't seen it, this blanker draws beautiful patterns on the screen while blanking it. You may find yourself watching just for the entertainment value. This version contains a couple of minor corrections and some new features.

## Defenda! by Jonathon Sole

If you always enjoyed the game Defender, this is your chance to play it again. This shareware version is beautifully done - with excellent graphics and sound. In case you are not familiar with the game, it is a space shoot-em-up. Your ship remains in the center of the screen while the landscape scrolls horizontally. If it moves, shoot it! Except of course for the little men which you are supposed to save from being carried off by the alien spacecraft. It's fast, furious fun. It's on MCCC1404.

a set of pictures that I had modified for use as Workbench backgrounds with NickPrefs for AmigaOS 2.0. This month I have more of the same. This selection of pics is just as good as the first. Look for them on MCCC-A\_407, MCCC-A\_408 and MCCC-A\_409.

## Postscript Fonts for PageStream

Once again... more fonts. It's getting a little silly. I now have over 12 megabytes of fonts on my hard drive. I don't keep them all - just the best ones... but the best ones just seem to keep on coming. This month's picks can be found on MCCC-A\_404 (Dupuy Light, Dupuy Regular and Dupuy Heavy), MCCC-A\_405 (HotDog, Eraser Dust, Holtzschue and Garton), and MCCC-A\_411 (Rounded Relief and WhatA-Relief).

## Initiatives

What Commodore needs to do to ensure its survival by Dan Barrett of the Tulsa Amiga Group have become very worried about the future of the my bedroom closet for several hours a day — that's how worried 1 am. My doctor says I should take a vacation. But I digress.

Anyway, here are some things that the Amiga absolutely needs in order to survive in today's brutal and innovative computer market. If it doesn't have all of them within the next seven days, Commodore will go bankrupt, the sky will fall, and little orange toasters will appear inside your nose.

Without a new chipset, I can definitely say, with all authority and confidence, that the Amiga will have the old chipset. This may come as a surprise, but I guarantee that it is true.

It is vitally important that Commodore find a way to make graphics totally independent of their display device. In fact, the Amiga should be able to display top-quality graphics in the total absence of hardware. Take away the device, and the picture should still be visible! I have noticed that when I stare at a bright light for a long time and then look away, I can still see the after-image, even though the light is gone. If I can do it, why can't Commodore?

simply cute. ' There are a pair of eyes that open up in a little window on the Workbench that follow the mouse pointer where ever it goes. The window can be sized - and the number of eyes can even be varied.

Every once in a while it's nice to see a little program come along that does absolutely nothing useful. (Actually, I think I've bought a few of those by accident... but this is one that isn't supposed to to anything useful.) JEyes is

Face it. Flickering video reminds me of tuna fish. No, I don't know why, but it is definitely a problem. The current A2320 display enhancer and other "flicker-fixing" devices are inadequate. After all, deep down in your heart, you still know that the video signal is flickering away... even if you can't see it. A total solution is to get rid of video entirely. After removing all the internal circuitry from the monitor, Commodore should send an employee to your house to entertain you with hand puppets.

In order to attract new customers, Commodore should start giving away Amigas for free. Personally, if a computer company gave me a free computer, I would run out immediately and buy one! This is the kind of loyalty Commodore needs to generate.

Ahhh, food. I think that every Amiga sold should come with a free pizza. I get hungry while hacking. Get with it, Commodore.

By now, everybody associates the name Commodore with "game machine", or at least "machine". To be taken more seriously, it's time for CBM to change its name to something more attention-getting and powerful.

I hope that Commodore and the Amiga community think hard about the above suggestions. Any reasonable company should be able to solve these problems in a matter of hours for about $12.95! Really!!

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The May Amiga By-The-Loop meeting was held as usual at the North Richland Hills Community Center. The attendance for this month's meeting was slightly lower than on previous months. Our president, David Owens, kicked off the evening's fun with the usual list of ongoing events sponsored by the club. The various up and coming activities of the MCCC, from the Spring Thing at Grapevine Lake, to the opportunity for club members to buy a 68040-powered expansion board for your A2000 at a very reasonable price. Harold Williams also drew people's attention to the new Superdisk of V2.0 utilities available from the club library.

If you read my column in last month's newsletter, you will be aware of our ever-popular librarian (Gary Campbell) antics with his A2000. This month Gary had everything under control and up the correct way!!

After many questions concerning various parts of the Amiga's anatomy were asked and answered, David released the meeting to Brett Hester (our Dallas Chapter VP) to demonstrate PARNET. PARNET is a method of connecting two Amigas via their Parallel ports. Each individual Amiga's resources (disks, printers, etc.) can then be accessed as a normal device from either computer. Brett demonstrated ParNet using an A2000 to link to a CDTV via a 25 ft long parallel cable that he very bravely offered to build for people at the meeting. This enabled his A2000 to use the CDTV's CDROM disk by just clicking on an icon on the A2000's Workbench window. If you cannot release your parallel port for communication, Brett mentioned that there is a serial version of this networking software called, not surprisingly, SERNet.

The evening ended with prizes from Ansoft Data Systems. Eldor Luedtke won an Amiga modem and Doug Gaudin won the mouse mat. Congratulations to both our winners and many thanks to Ansoft for their generosity.

The Loop chapter hopes to see you all at our next meeting in June when we will have a presentation given by Ansoft Data Systems.

## Amiga Central Ray Howard

This month's question and answer section covered a myriad of topics. First was a discussion of where 2.0 keeps system default information. Virus prevention and detection was discussed. Other topics were genlock and toaster problems, usage, and setup. Interest in getting started with Imagine led to the mention of Jody Reimer's Studio BBS, which is the hangout for anyone interested in 3D objects creation including developers, and a discussion on using modems. Mentioned in the rumor/development stage was a 24-bit frame-buffer from a local company that is capable of Hires overscan 4096 color animation at a 25 frame/sec rate using even a 1MB machine.

Scott Lamb of CREOTEC, Inc. demonstrated their VidDISC demo. VidDISC is a demonstration of CREOTEC's interactive multimedia authoring system. This authoring system is used to create interactive multimedia applications for CDTV. Ten frame/sec full motion animations with up to 64,000 colors can be created using CDTV's CDXL capabilities. The applications on the VidDISC demo include a full video/audio guided tour of the main hall at the Amon Carter Museum, an example of an interactive information kiosk, interactive training and education. The VidDISC is fully indexed allowing

Harold Williams wrapped up the meeting by giving away four door prizes donated by Ansoft Data Systems. Bob Morgan and Hans Stretch won a free video rental good for one of Ansoft's Amiga tutorial tapes. Adam Hill won a Commodore Amiga coffee mug and Ray Howard won a Commodore 1680 modem. See you at the meeting next month for more good times and excellent information about the Amiga!

one to jump to specific topics of interest. Currently CREOTEC masters the applications for their customers. The company plans to release a full commercial product within six to eight months that will allow one to create a full blown interactive multimedia application for CDTV.

Ever have one of those lives? We drove out to Grapevine in the pouring rain, decided nobody was coming to the picnic and went back to Plano, just before the charcoal and some of my favorite people arrived. The next Wednesday, I realized at 3 p.m. that the MCCC meeting was That Night and I had somehow forgotten all about it. Then, at the meeting, I checked my calendar to be sure I had all weekend to get this written, as the deadline is the 4th Saturday. I wonder what month I was looking at. Wasn't May, folks. Here's my best midnight-oil shot:

We had a surprise visit from well-known computer artist Marilyn Coughran, who explained that the SCOPE Art SIG is now a separate entity, and invites MCCC members to join them. She also gave us an update on an upcoming local video and art show. Our President, Henry Ribron, introduced us to the AmTRAC trackball from MicroSpeed, which we can see and play with and purchase (through the club) at a

special discount. The Demo Model is to be given away eventually to a lucky MCCC member. We also saw a Fusion 40 board, a 68040 accelerator with room for extra memory, which also is offered at a special club discount. Contact Harold Williams on that one. New in the library: a 2.0-related Neat Stuff disk, put together by Harold Williams. Mentioned: a nifty screen-blanker with a swarm of bees buzzing by and a nice touch: it checks your CPU activity, and if the Amiga is very busy it selects a plain screen instead. (Doesn't mess up rendering, etc.) Recommended for the gaming set: the Populous World Editor. Warning: addictive. Many people had stuff for sale, and we welcome such swapping, but remember that we'll have another fleamarket at the 1992 METCOM in October, if you can wait.

On to our demo of the evening: Danny Barnett presented features of sound sampling and MIDI use. He began with an original musical offering, which started out with a rhythmical (but not astonishing for the Amiga) background. Then he added the "live" touch on the MIDI keyboard, and tossed in some truly weird sound effects with the other hand. Meanwhile, odd and interesting things were happening on the screen. Then came the best part: seeing how it all came together. He was running an A500 with 1 meg of memory and an second floppy drive... very little equipment to make very snazzy audio. Danny reminded us of the super-sophisticated sound chip that the Amiga came with in 1985, which enabled good, high-quality music to be generated at an incredibly low cost. Before the birth of the Amiga came the MIDI, which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. (You always wondered but were afraid to ask, right?) Special instruments designed with a MIDI interface can be controlled by signals from a computer. The interface itself is a gadget that connects to your RS232 port and communicates with the instrument, which is generally a keyboard. [Note: the CDTV has a built-in MIDI, just add instrument and application software.] Danny's keyboard, a KAWAI model that he got for around $400 (a very good deal), comes with many "instrument" voices which can be not only controlled by the Amiga but may be uploaded and stored on disk. Likewise, the Amiga sound files could be sent down to the keyboard. Keyboards range from the earlier analog types (ranging from the $200s) to the newer and more pricey

digital models, to the "samplers" which can synthesize ANY waveform and are very expensive. Of course, there are many sound files available on the Amiga (check our library for all 6 of Danny's collections!), but you can make your own using a digitizer. This brings into play the next gadget: an AMAS (Advanced MIDI Amiga Sampler) which costs around $130. It connects to your CD player, VCR, or handy microphone and grabs sounds right from your favorite source. Although it comes with instructions and software, Danny prefers the AudioMaster software for manipulating the sound samples. Now for the curious display on the monitor while Danny played his tune: we were watching MED, a PD music-generating program which was created in Finland. (It's on Fred Fish #483.) You can connect the four voices to Amiga sounds OR the MIDI connection, and let the Amiga copilot while you carry the melody on your own. A non-PD version called OctaMed somehow gives the Amiga *g* voices... don't ask me how. (Demo on FF# 579). Having used SONIX and Deluxe Music, I felt the input and display style of MED was a Pain, but I can see the power of the note-by-note control over what comes OUT, and overlook the problems of getting the notes IN. So, we played

with assorted digitized samples, used a PD program to employ them as instruments, connected our Amiga to a keyboard with many sounds of its own, and put them all together with a bit of Danny's fingerplay and we had Music! Very interesting, very fun. I want to play too!

Our doorprizes were varied and generous, as always: from The Edge came three AdvantEdge discount cards, Predator II, and a nifty Beetle Mouse; and from our friends at Metropolitan came Ham It Up (sit down, Brett!), Jinks, and Stellaryx. Hope you will all join us next month. Like I said at the top, I didn't get to do my pre-newsletter research properly, so come be as surprised as Ill be at the demo topic in June!

## Amiga West Ben Clingerman

April's meeting featured "The Toaster Guy", , Brett Hester. Brett presented a demonstration of ParNet (The poor man's Network). Brett connected an Amiga 2500 and a CDTV with Par-Net software. Using a cable configured for the CDTV to 2500, Brett was able to operate either machine and access any nonprotected files from either the CDTV or the 2500. Brett installed the CDTV version of the game Lemmings and was able to play it from the Amiga 2500 — and he was also able to play Lemmings on the CDTV at the same time as well. This is most interesting for those of us who would like to be able to access CDTV's great library of disks with Encyclopedias or games but also still use our 2000s or 3000s as the controller instead of CDTV's keyboard or mouse. It looks like a great addition to the already fantastic collection of public domain and shareware titles that we at MCCC have. Thank you, Brett, for the introduction to this software's use and possibilities.

May's meeting was rather informal due to the cancellation of a feature speaker from The Edge who was going to demonstrate "something new out there" (and there are a lot of new things out there). This new item is called "The Blizzard" — a low end accelerator with high end quality, but cheaper than Ad-Aide. I hope The Edge will be able to reschedule the demo for us at a later date because everyone at the meeting seemed to agree we would like to see what that puppy can do!

Ansoft Data Systems donated Bizclips' Toaster 3D Objects for May's door prize. Jack Smith wound up with the prize and was a smiling happy camper as he left the meeting. Thank YOU, Ansoft, for the support that you always give us.

Next month I'm going to demo the Migraph grey-scale hand scanner, so anyone who would like to have a photo scanned to disk (preferably black &amp; white no larger than 5x7) bring the photo and a blank disk to our meeting and I'll scan it for you. We hope you'll join us at our next meeting. Have a Amiga Day!

Q-Link. After some questions about the user, it produces a fill-in-theblanks will. The author says he hopes the will would be valid in every state, but he urges the user to have it reviewed by an attorney.

Another program John had downloaded from Q Link was C128 Disk File 5.0. He demonstrated this by using it to catalogue the MCCC library catalogue disks and pointed out that we could use it to inventory our own disk collections. He gave this tip to C64 owners using a similar program, Disk File 4.9 from Q-Link: When the program slows down noticeably because memory is filling up, press A to return to the menu, save the file, reload and start again.

When a new member asked if it was possible to print a disk directory without using a program, we oldtimers said, "Of course, you just..." and then none of us could remember exactly what to do. Very embarrassing.

Our next meeting will be June 13, 1:30 pm, in Room 540 at TCOM. We'll have a copy of the old "Hints and Shortcuts" ", and we'll try to solve old and new problems.

## H.E.B. Robyn Wilson

At the May meeting, Jesse Cardin resigned as Treasurer for the HEB Chapter. He has done his job well and we wish him well with his future endeavors!

We will be at the Hurst Recreation Center for the June meeting. There is not going to be a July meeting. The August meeting will be at the Hurst Rec Center also. We have lots in store for both the June and August program. Your support is needed to make our chapter work! Please come and enjoy learning about your computer system. We welcome your questions, problems, and difficulties always.
