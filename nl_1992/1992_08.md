## Virtual Reality Studio

## "Reality — what a concept" by Aaron Lozier

K, you just got back from another 8 hours of work, only to find the house a wreck, dinner burnt, and your baby crying. "Well, nothing new here... Just the same old crummy world." Well, with Virtual Reality Studio by Domark, you don't have to put up with this! You can go into your room, lock the door, turn on your Amiga, and begin to create your own "virtual" worlds!

First off, virtual reality is the science of creating a world using polygon graphics including cubes, pyramids, rectangles, hexagons, pentagons, quads (four sided objects, i.e. diamonds, parallelograms), and lines. You must be thinking, "What kind of a world could I make with just those?" You'd be very surprised. Included in the software package is a F1 Indy racer, a space shuttle, a helicopter, and a tree, just to give you an idea of what you can build. I recently created a world set 20 years in the future!

With Virtual Reality Studio, you can create your dream house and design any kind of furniture imaginable to put in it. Then you can give your friends a tour of your future house. You can also create a village, a city, a country, a world! The limit is your imagination.

One of the other features of Virtual Reality Studio is the ability to make a 3D adventure game. Included on the disk is a game called Studio Game, an off-the-wall adventure game where you try to escape from a virtual world and return to Earth in a space shuttle, gathering gold bars along the way. Sounds crazy, but it gives you a good look at everything possible on the software. Now, you may be wondering about creating a game, and giving it to the public domain. Do you have to upload the whole virtual reality system, instantly becoming a pirate? NO! It has a feature which allows you to create a stand-alone game or world that runs independently of the software. No runner necessary! That way, you can send a copy of your house to a distant Amiga relative.

The software is very simple to figure out. It comes with a VHS tape tutorial and a simple to understand manual. The original retail price was $92, but I ordered it for $52 from Computability. Either way, it's well worth the price.

The software says it requires a stock Amiga 500 with 512k RAM. I say that's bologna! It requires 1 MEG, unless you're not creating more than a cube. Also, an accelerated Amiga would be nice. After creating lots of stuff at 7.16 MHz, it begins to slow down considerably. However, you could still probably get by. (I am!)

I'm hoping to be able to give a demonstration to the Amiga Central Chapter as soon as possible. So, if you want to see Virtual Reality Studio in action, give Johnny Kitchens a nudge for me, OK? You won't regret it. I

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

This is one of those "must have" system enhancement programs. By now most of you know about Tool Manager. Tool Manager allows you to add items of your choice to the AmigaOS 2.0 "Tools" menu. It keeps you from having to open up window after window to find the program you are looking for. The problem with Tool Manager is that it is limited to just the "Tools" menu. It quickly becomes too large, extending to the bottom of the screen and then wrapping back up for a second column. Wouldn't it be nice to have multiple menus of your own choosing? That's where ParM comes in.

ParM stands for Paramatrable Menu and, actually, you can choose the way ParM works. You can attach menus to the Workbench, to a shell, or run the program as a separate application. (In this case, you simply click on the ParM window to activate it and then use the menu button to access the attached menus.) But the way it makes most sense to me is to attach menus to the Workbench. All it takes is a simple script... it's not complicated at all. You can have as many menus as there are room for. The menus start just to the right of the "Tools" menu. Hint: Keep the names of the menu short and you'll have room for more of them. Even sub-menus are supported — something Tool Manager should have thought of.

This program doesn't eliminate the need for Tool Manager since you will still want access to your "Tools" menu, but the two work together beautifully. I've been using ParM for over a month now and have had no problems at all. By the way, it runs on both Workbench 1.3 and 2.0. Check it out. It's on MCCC-A\_421.

## WB-Pies by Bill Raecke

This is becoming something of a tradition. As usual, I have prepared some more pictures to use on a 16color interlaced Workbench. Each comes with a correct palette and there is an ARexx randomizing program so a random picture can be selected at boot time. Simply add the program to your userstartup. Of course NickPrefs is required to make them work — and NickPrefs is not included on these disks. There are nine pictures on MCCC-A\_418, six pictures on MCCC-A\_419, three pictures on MCCC-A \_420, and five more on MCCC-A 425. Some of these will knock your socks off. Practice makes perfect.

## FracBlank by Olaf Barthel

This is an update to an earlier program. It's a 2.0 screen blanker. It's version 2.2. It comes with versions for standard Amigas and for those with math coprocessors. And it's probably one of the most interesting screen blankers available. This version adds a new fractal type... the cosmic flame. It also sports some enhanced color modes. It can be found on MCCC-A\_425.

## Virus Checker by John Veldthuis

This is version 6.15 of the most popular virus checker around. Be sure to get it... and run it each time you bring a new disk into your home. Remember, you don't have to be a pirate to get viruses... they can be purchased. Make sure you practice safe computing. Virus Checker is on MCCC-A

## Postscript Fonts

Another tradition is the inclusion, each month, of a fresh batch of Postscript fonts. This month's collection includes Bell Bottom, a nice-looking display font with letters that are flared at the bottom; and Heidelberg, a Germanic-looking script font — both on MCCC-A\_422. On MCCC-A 423 you'll find several unusual display fonts (Animal, Davy's Key Caps, and Trains) as well as Gismonda, a very nice looking script font and several others worth having.

## Public Screen Utilities

There are a couple of updates to public screen utilities on this month's disks. For those who may not know, public screens are a feature of AmigaOS 2.0. You are allowed to open up screens and then have your applications open on those screens instead of on the Workbench. Comes in handy if you need an extra-large screen, or perhaps more or fewer colors than you have on Workbench. On MCCC-A\_424 is a tool simply called PublicScreen by Edward D. Berger. It's a basic utility — not a lot of options. On MCCC-A\_423 is Public Manager by Michael Watzl. It has a lot more options. And it even opens the public screens with menus attached so that the characteristics of the screen can be easily changed.

## Pictures

Once in a while a picture comes along worth adding to your collection. On MCCC-A\_424 is a digitized black and white photograph of a cat. Included are the original JPEG picture and a 16-color IFF image processed by me with The Art Department. It's good enough that you'll want to add it to your collection.

## Tracker Musie

For tracker fans, there are several tunes worth getting this month. You'll find collections on MCCC-A\_426 and MCCC-A\_427. Players are included on the disks. All you need to do is click on the program, select the MOD or MED file to play, and enjoy.

## File Compression

What to do with those files after you download them by Johnny C. Kitchens ossibly the most asked question I hear coming from people just getting into telecommunications 1s, "What do those file names mean and how do I make them run?" A good question... and hopefully one I can straighten up a little. The confusion can be a bit upsetting upon first time exposure. The Amiga is so easy to use with its point and click interface, but when you get a file that refuses to run no matter what you do it can be the beginning of a bad day. Let's take a look at some of these files and see if we can figure them out.

Usually, the key to figuring out what the files are is the extender. You will have a name with a period and three letters placed at the end. A good example would be "filename.lzh". Those last three letters make all the difference in the world in getting it to work. Here is a list of extensions you may come across as you look at files on the BBS. This list will show the last three letters you will see on filenames.

Program to use or what to do

| ARC   | 1 ARC, PKax                        |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| ARJ   | UnARJ                              |
| DEX   | Self Extracting                    |
| DMP   | DImp (Disk Imploder)               |
| DMS   | DiskMasher                         |
| DOC   | Read with a text reader            |
| EXE   | Executable, just execute or run it |
| IFF   | Any image viewer                   |
| LHA   | LhA, LZ (use LhA)                  |
| LZH   | LhArc, LhArcA, LhA, LZ (use LhA)   |
| PAK   | Self Extracting                    |
| RUN   | Self Extracting                    |
| SFX   | Self Extracting                    |
| SHR   | Shrink                             |
| TXT   | Read with a text reader            |
| WRP   | UnWarp, Warp                       |
| ZAP   | Zap                                |
| ZIP   | UnZip, Zip, PKAZip                 |
| ZOM   | Zoom                               |
| ZOO   | Zoo                                |

These are the most common, but not all. There are many that are used to identify files created by other programs for use by those programs such as word processors. Those listed above are the ones you are more likely to come across in dealing with telecommunications and file transfers. Occasionally someone makes a mistake and the file will have no extender or a wrong extender. I use a hexreader to find out what kind of file it is. This is a rare occurrence and hopefully won't happen to you.

What many of these extensions mean are that the files were compressed using the program I listed and may include several files in one. The reason for this is to decrease transfer time and to make it easier to transfer several files at once. The files are also compressed so as to save space. These are the ones we are mainly interested in here, as they cause the confusion. Why are there so many different ways of doing this? Well, over time different programmers have had different ideas on how to do it, and as time passes their ideas improve compression and/or speed. Here are some comparisons of the compression abilities of the file compressors. The original file size was 128,785 bytes.

| Arc      |   67644 | LhA .LHA   |   51300 |
|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| LhA LZH  |   53905 | LhArc      |   56097 |
| LhArcSFX |   58484 | LhASFX     |   57412 |
| LZ LHA   |   51468 | LZ LZH     |   53904 |
| Pak      |   93184 | PKAZip     |   52110 |
| Shrink   |   48472 | Zip        |   51602 |
| Zoo      |   51637 | Zoo        |   65139 |

LhA, LZ, and Zoo each have two compression modes. Using the higher compression modes in LhA or LZ produces the files with extenders .LHA, and the lower compression mode produces the .LZH extension. Z0o doesn't produce a different extension for its two compression modes. As you can see, its higher compression mode is right up there with the best. As you can also see, Shrink produces the smallest files, but takes by far the longest time to compress or decompress the files. By far, the easiest way to manipulate all these different file compressors is by using Directory OPUS or Disk Master. They can be set up to automatically recognize the file extension and to send the extracted files to a specified destination automatically. Simply doubleclick and away you go. They also make creating the archives simply a matter of choosing the files you want to include in the archive and do it. The downside to them is the fact that you will have to set them up for some of these extensions. It's not hard but can be intimidating for some. It's definitely worth the trouble if you find yourself having to deal with these files very often.

Perhaps the easiest to use compressed files are the ones described previously as self-extracting. These files can be copied or moved to any convenient place and from your Shell or CLI simply type their name and the file will extract automatically for you. These are a good way to get started, as many important files needed to get started in telecommunication are compressed in this manner. Look for the extension of self extracting files especially if you are just starting out.

Extracting the other file types are more complicated. If you get a file with the extension .200 then you will

need to get the program Zoo. You need to read the documentation that comes with it for detailed instructions. For those in a hurry, simply type Zoo and a simply type 2o and a programs - a few will require you to read the

Files with the extensions DMS, ZOM, DMP, WRP, or DEX are compressed disk files. A whole disk is run through the archiver to produce a single file which can be transferred easily through the modem. If you get one of these they will extract to a blank disk or you can use RAD: for a quick way of taking a look at them. A word of warning on these, some of them can take over 15 minutes to extract to a disk on a stock 68000 machine.

brief instruction on how to use it will appear, and that will help get you started. This holds true for most of these instructions.

Armed with this information I hope you find telecommunication a little easier to figure out, and more enjoyable. There is a large amount of information and data to look at and use in the telecommunication world just waiting for you. Now go and get it!

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

July is here already and the Amiga By-The-Loop meeting was one of those "You really should have been there" - there being the North Richland Hills Community Center.

As usual David Owens, (Loop President, Yep we still got one!) started the evening with a welcome to the new members. He then continued by introducing the "Shareware contribution" (I remember doing that... !!!) for LHA, a very popular compression program.

take too long to put the AVideo board into the A2000, but I did notice Harold keeping a very watchful eye on what was going on.!! So why Harold's machine? Well the answer is simple - it is equipped with a Motorola 68030 accelerator card and according to Jim "Since you are moving huge chunks of data in the paint programs, the 68000 needs some help. Unfortunately I don't have an accelerated Amiga myself!" So Harold kindly offered to help out.

Unfortunately the turnout was lower than normal on this second Tuesday. On the other hand the American League creamed the National League in the All-star Game. So, those who stayed home to watch it, missed one of those presentations that will stay with us for a good while, but I digress.

First things first, the hardware will fit any Amiga that has a DENISE chip in a socket. This is both good and bad, good since those of us without video slots can still get this kind of video power and bad because you have to carefully remove pieces of your computer and put them back in different places. Voiding warranties et al. This was particularly true for Harold Williams' A2000 that was rudely stripped down to its circuit board and divested of certain chips and re-assembled purely for the demo. It really did not

Well the demonstration was one of those that didn't quite go as planned. The hardware worked flawlessly, but the software installation on Harold's hard disk gave us plenty of time to ask and answer questions from FAX Modems to printer drivers.

For more information on AVideo12 and AVideo24 call your local dealer. Thanks to Jim and INOVAtronics for the demonstration and also to Harold for the loan of his machine.

Finally Jim managed to nail down an elusive library and TVPaint appeared on a 1084 monitor (no multi-sync monitors required for this product!!). After some strange mouse/pointer conflicts, Jim managed to demonstrate TVPaint for us and also to show some 24bit IFF pictures. The paint program is designed to be intuitive to use with the standard type of Dpaint icons and all IFF file types.

The Loop chapter hopes to see you all at our next meeting in August.

## Amiga Central Ray Howard

The June meeting featured Aaron Hightower and his Pacman game. The game is an accurate reconstruction of the arcade game including later extensions such as Ms. Pacman screens. The game utilizes the Amiga's superbitmap and smooth scolling capabilities to allow one to have mazes greater than the actual screen size. Game play can be controlled via joystick or keyboard. The game is fully multitasking and system friendly. Included is a board construction tool for creating your own mazes. This game is a must for Pacman fans. Check the library for a copy of this great shareware game.

July brought Brett Hester to Amiga Central for an animated discussion and demonstration of his Parbench setup. Brett's Parbench utilizes the public domain software called ParNet to enable two Amigas and/or CDTVs to share all devices from serial ports and hard drives to floppy and CD-ROM drives. Brett demonstrated the ability to use a CDTV as a CD-ROM drive for an Amiga 2000 to access the Fred Fish Collection on CD-ROM. A copy of the Parbench programs is available from the club library.

The question and answer session included a discussion on adding SCSI tape drives to your Amiga. Topics covered backup programs, device drivers, and SCSI bus termination. Questions about the Video Toaster were also brought up.

The main topic of the question and answer session was modems, in particular high speed data/fax modems from Supra. It was announced that Supra is shipping a ROM upgrade for their modems to correct some problems. Scott Lamb observed that their fax send and receive software worked very well. Another topic covered was the effects of the differences in priority of fast and chip RAM and what this means to a program requesting memory.

Join us on the third Thursday in August when INOVAtronics will be showing their new 24-bit video card, the AVideo, for all Amigas. It will allow the simultaneous display of a standard Amiga screen, a 12- or 24bit image or anim, and genlocked live video. See you at the Arlington Community Center.

This month's presentation was given by Jim O'Flaherty from INOVAtronics on a Hardware/Software product called AVideo. AVideo was designed in France and is being distributed in the USA by INOVAtronics. The product comes in two flavors: a 12bit graphic enhancer (AVideo 12), with AVPaint12 and a 24 bit graphic enhancer (AVideo 24), with TVPaint, a full broadcast quality 24bit paint program.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Our July meeting started on time for a change, probably because somebody knew I was going to be late... I assume there were interesting tidbytes exchanged, but I missed 'em! (Sorry). We also missed our president Henry Ribron, who was in the "spot"-light at home... with chicken pox! Our V.P. Brett Hester took charge and introduced our star of the evening, Scott Lamb, with his demo of VidDISC by Creotech.

quality production together on their own. The problem is, a professionallooking end product requires very expensive tools (the video equipment, the audio stuff, the education and skill painstakingly acquired) to produce quality output, no matter how slick or inexpensive the authoring package and computer system may be. The reason VidDISC made a great demo was that it drives our little Amiga's exceptional capabilities to the limit, and we got to see just how far it can go. Scott began with a "talking head" illustration, where the "motion video"

images. That suddenly made what we were seeing much more impressive! He explained that the rather jerky "talking head" was fullscreen video at 3 frames/second, the fastest the system could do at that size. But when the image was only 30% of the screen, a rate of 10 frames/second could be displayed, resulting in much smoother motion. We are used to about three times that rate, on TV etc., but the images I saw were not distractingly jerky. Nobody else but the Amiga can do 64,000 colors at this rate with this big an image. The CPU is under "ex-

VidDISC is an authoring application designed and used inhouse by Creotech to build snazzy interactive multi-media productions for clients. It is not yet available to the end user, but may soon be offered to those who want to try to put a was synched with the audio of a sales pitch. This was followed by a "live" looking horserace and a jet landing, complete with sound. Scott had to remind us that what we were watching was NOT a video tape, but a frame-by-frame recreation of digital

treme duress" , running 11 tasks simultaneously on 3 processors. ' The VidDISC application calls on Commodore's "CDXL" software to play motion video off the CDTV. According to Scott, you can store 72 minutes of motion video on one CD, requiring continual disk access at the maximum data transfer rate. When you think that the system costs less than $800, it's awesome.

The applications for VidDISC are limitless, but we immediately pounced on game ideas. We got to tour a museum "live" , where the VidDISC framework allowed us to

"walk around" and played tour guide for the many works of art displayed. We could closely inspect a certain painting (with several degrees of close-up images available), and choose an audio lecture on the artist while we checked the brushstrokes.

## CHAPTER NEWS

(We walked up to one painting from across the room, and got so close my eyes crossed.) A bit of a debate ensued on the value of such a tool in education. While we wish students would use the timeless wealth of books to expand their education, it's sad but true that fewer and fewer people can read well or choose to do so. On the other hand, as Scott put it, we are all experts at watching TV! If the TV can hold your attention with pictures, motion, and sound, and you can explore your subject of interest with a push of a button, maybe learning will be more attractive to today's young people. Unfortunately, education doesn't have the money to invest in the kind of "Hollywood" production that would make such products worthwhile. This is why those encyclopedias, etc. are so expensive, and haven't sold as widely as hoped... they cost a fortune to produce (with all the great pictures and sounds, etc. tied to the text) and are just not used enough in the average home to be worth the price. Relatively cheap one-floppy software can move off the shelf in a hurry, but Scott's demo filled a whole CD - 550 megabytes of data! Still, there are markets for the output of VidDISC's artistry, such as a Lear Jet "pre-flight check" training package we saw, or fancy sales presentations. If you have an application in mind, Creotech can use VidDISC to make it happen. They can help collect all the audio and video samples you need, and VidDISC, with its event-driven user interface and elaborate indexing system can tie it all together. Thanks, Scott!

We have several interesting things brewing for the August meeting, but as of this writing we are awaiting confirmation, so please come and see what's cookin' on August 19th! I'll close with Danny Barnett's Acronym of the Month: AMIGA = Any Marketing Is Greatly Appreciated. &lt;chuckle&gt;

## Amiga West

Ben Clingerman

At the June meeting of Amiga West I demonstrated the different uses of the Migraph Hand Scanner. I also overviewed the Touch-Up software which came packaged with the scanner.

Door prizes were donated by Ansoft Data Systems. Dot &amp; Eldor Luedtke won a copy of Pinball Dreams then they traded for an Amiga coffee mug that Robert Carroll had won. David Lehr also won a Amiga coffee mug. Thank you, Ansoft for the door prizes.

At the July meeting the demonstration was of three word processing programs. Doug Gaudin previewed Excellence! for us. Robert Carroll previewed the shareware program Text Plus. I previewed Pro Write.

The Amiga West meeting will be

At the August Meeting we will vote for new officers or to merge with another Amiga chapter. As I've stated in previous articles to the newsletter, Amiga West has been hit especially hard by our area's economy. We have now lost our President, Jack Smith, who has moved out of town. Also, Robert Carroll is moving to attend Harvard University, so we are losing our VicePresident also. Both Jack and Robert will be sorely missed. We wish them and their families the very best.

at 7:30 P.M., August 13th, Room #106, Building #2 at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. If you want this Chapter to continue we all need to support it.

## Fort Worth Mary Louise Hagemeyer

Our Vice President, John Burt, is doing a good job of browsing through the library to find useful programs. For our July meeting, he presented a collection of printerrelated programs from several disks including:

Big Dump (#340) - prints a character screen dump;

Overlay 128 (#710) - prints a template for the C64 keyboard with user-supplied key meanings;

C64 Function Key Cribsheet Maker (#425) — makes a template for just the function keys;

Gary Labels (#250) - prints mailing labels using PrintShop graphics and a choice of fonts;

Disk Jacket Maker (#827) - prints directory so that paper can be cut and folded to make a disk jacket;

PrintShop Graphics (#347) - has 80 graphics and a program to print them on a page for reference.

John demonstrated a public domain package called Stationary Store Il, written by some spelling impaired people to print lined paper, graph paper, music sheets, calendars, forms - just about anything you might need.

Next month join us for more program demonstrations in a cool room with a fine view of Fort Worth. The meeting will be August 8, 1:30 pm, in Room 540 at TCOM.

Too bad we couldn't get a CDTV as a doorprize, but what we did have was great: Metropolitan contributed Purple Saturn Day (won by Forrest McKinney) and Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Training 2.0 (won by Bill Harmon). The Edge brought us a new release of Jaguar XJ220 (won by Suzy Streich), and two
