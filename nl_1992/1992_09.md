## METCOM 92

## It's almost here by David Owens

wo months. Only two months left. Make your of the decade!!! Ok, Ok. Would you believe the year? On October 24th, 1992 the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club (MCCC for short for those new to the club) will put on METCOM for the eighth time in so many years. So you ask, "What is METCOM?" METCOM is a day of fun and excitement for the whole family. It's a day of education, presentations, dealers and our club area. It is mainly a day for you. But I get ahead of myself. Let me start again.

presentations. It has been rumored that Commodore will be at METCOM and have exciting news and maybe some of the new machines that the rumor mill has been talking about. The October newsletter will have a more complete agenda of the presentations and topics to be discussed. Spread the word.

This year our thrust at METCOM will be education. The classes we held last year were so enthusiastically received, we decided to center this year's show around them. Harold Williams is in charge of our classes this year and (being a teacher at heart) has some great classes for us to attend. There should be something for just about everyone. The classes that have been scheduled are: AmigaOS 2.0, ARexx, CanDo, telecommunications, and the Video-Toaster. The classes will have a small fee based on the length of the class and the classes will run from 1 1/2 to 3 hours with scheduled breaks. Included in this newsletter, you should find a registration form for the tentative classes. If any class does not have enough interest, another class may be scheduled in its place. Check the registration form for more details.

Next up are the presentations. All of the presentations will be FREE!!! That's right. FREE. These will be open to anyone. Your Uncle Bill, Aunt Martha or your friend who owns an IBM and wants to see what a real computer can do. The presentations will last about an hour with time for Q&amp;A afterwards. We have three presentations lined up with one more to be scheduled. The presenters include some impressive dealers such as Ansoft &amp; Metropolitan and the developer INOVAtronics. The topics haven't been firmed up as of yet, but these three have never let us down on exciting discussions and

Dealers. Our dealer tables have always been an exciting event at METCOM and we expect they will be again this year. Metropolitan has already signed up for a huge area of dealer space, and I know from previous experience they will have lots of goodies to browse through and buy. They have always had good sales items at METCOM. INOVAtronics has indicated that they are planning to make an appearance in the dealer's area. They are responsible for such great Amiga products as CanDo, Directory Opus (not the funny bird with the big nose!), Hyper Helper, the Hi-Q tower and more. Check them out. Computer Etc. (C-64 &amp; C-128 goodies) indicated that they wanted space before we even had space available. Way to go. These are all I know about at this time, but I'll have a more complete list for the October newsletter. Let's plan on supporting our dealers and developers at METCOM.

Last, but not least, is our club area. This will be held in the same area as the dealer/developer's room. In years past, we have had a flea market, the club library, help tables, 13 months for the price of 12 memberships and renewals, and digitizing pictures of you and your loved ones. Ok, Ok... that is what was done in the past. What, you may ask, are we doing this year?? We will have a special price on new memberships/renewals, the club library will be available for you to get the newest and oldest programs/files/pictures, and the flea market. I guess one reason I always enjoy going to METCOM every year is for the flea market. Last year I bought a hard disk controller card, extra memory, and a couple of games I

## Amiga Library News

Public Domain and Shareware Picks from Bill Raecke

P ageStream Stuff It's a good month for PageStream owners. There are a set of various templates on MCCC-A\_ 430 including one that shows how to use the Post Office approved bar-coding to put on mailing labels. On that same disk are a couple of updated import drivers... one for IFF pictures and one for DR2D files. And on MCCC-A\_431 you'll find a new Postscript printer driver.

On MCCC-A\_433 are four new Postscript fonts: Abbess, Accord, Amethyst and AnticFont. All are very nice and worth adding to your collection.

## Amethyst Abbess

## Anticrent

On MCCC-A\_430, you'll find a large set of EPS ClipArt. There are 34 clips in all... and they're all worth getting. Since they are EPS format, and therefore structured clips rather than bitmapped clips, they look good when printed out at any size to any printer. And, if you are using PageStream, you can even edit them to your liking. Check 'em out.

## Mandelmania by Markus Zehnder

fastest I've run across. On my machine (a

For those of you who like to play around with fractals, there are a couple of new toys this month. The first is Mandelmania, which you can find on MCCC-A\_431. I know that by now most people have all the Mandelbrot programs they can use, but Mandelmania is one that you definitely need to add to your collection. It offers several very nice features. The most important feature is speed. Mandelmania is fast! In fact, it's the

68030 running at 33 mhz) the basic

Mandelbrot is calculated in 3 seconds on a 640 x 400 screen. There is a point-and-click zoom feature, cursor key scrolling and a variable window size for a fast preview of your settings. Mandelmania can support all screen modes including full overscan and superbitmap autoscroll displays.

There is also a full implementation of the Julia set — meaning that you can display a different Julia fractal for each point in the Mandelbrot set... and then, of course, you can explore the resulting Julia set just the same as the Mandelbrot from which it was derived. Also included is an ARexx port which can automate your explorations or which can build standard ·anim animations. A couple of sample ARexx scripts are included to get you started.

## Lyapunov by Steve Hines

very full-featured. Lores, Hires, Non-interlaced and Interlaced modes are all available. Although overscan is not provided for, pictures can be any size on a super bitmapped screen. An obvious oversight is the lack of a palette requester... but I have found that modifying the palette in another program after the fact is perfectly acceptable.

Lyapunov is another fractal generator. Instead of the Mandelbrot set, this one explores a set called the Lyapunov set (surprise!). The pictures are very beautiful. A couple of examples are included. The program itself is

Lyapunou has one problem. it is SLOW! This may not be a complaint with the program itself — it may simply be that this fractal type takes a while to generate. In any case, be prepared to wait. For example, one of the pictures included with the program took 17 hours to generate on a 68020 equipped Amiga running at 16 mhz. To make the waiting easier, Lyapunov has been designed to run quite nicely in the you don't need to watch it, the picture is generated in fast RAM rather than using precious chip RAM. When the picture is complete, it is automatically saved to a predetermined IFF file. You get to choose the destination and file name.

You'll find this one on MCCC-A\_431 as well... the same disk as Mandelmania.

## Tracker-Music

For those who are collecting Tracker and MED music files, you'll find several nice additions on MCCCA 432. My favorites? Look for a theme with eight variations composed by Mozart at the age of nine. Also check out a tune called Virginny; a ragtime piece with a very realistic honky-tonk piano. And there's a tune called Virgin that makes for nice listening. As always, Tracker and MED music files are distributed with players on the disk. All you need to do is click on the player icon and then select the mod or med tune to play. By the way, Virginny comes with its own player. Click on the Virginny icon to play it.

## Quantum

info from Mike Simoneaux of the New Orleans Commodore Klub wners of Quantum hard disk drives should be their mass storage devices. According to recent posts to several of the major BBS's, there are problems with using some of the newer Quantum drives - such as the LPS 52 and 105, and the newer 120 and 240 megabyte SCSI units. Some problems reported include the inability to use more than one such drive with an Amiga 2091 controller, or an Amiga 3000. Others have reported data errors while using the newer 120 and 240 megabyte units.

All of this should be of great concern to Amiga owners, as most of the Amiga computers sold with hard disks in the last two years have come with Quantum drives, and many owners buying third-party controllers have also specified or wound up with Quantum drives due to the sterling reputation that these units have acquired over the years. I personally have owned two such drives and have not had any problems with either of them, but if you are experiencing unusual crashes, loss of data, or the inability to access more than one hard drive hooked up to your SCSI buss, please call either the controller vendor, or Quantum.

During a recent call to Quantum for other purposes, I questioned one of the technicians about the sound emanating from Quantum hard drives approximately every 15 minutes while in use, whether being accessed or not. I also inquired as to wy Quantum drives are apparently able to low level format so quickly sometimes in mere seconds.

The answers to my questions pretty much confirmed my own uspicions. The noise heard about every 15 minutes is due to the drive re-calibrating itself due to thermal changes during operation. In other words, the drive's circuitry calls for a test and re-calibration due to the changes in temperature that the drive undergoes during operation. This assures that your drive will always be properly aligned.

How is it possible for a drive to calibrate itself? It's possible because Quantum drives have servo tracks permanently embedded on the hard disk platters. These tracks act as a lasting guide that the mechanism can count on during calibration. This also explains why Quantum drives low level format so quickly. They don't really undergo a typical low level format. What happens when a low level format command is issued to one of these units is that the area where the file record is kept on the on-board drive controller is wiped clean. This takes very little time. Since the drive uses embedded servo tracks, it would be pointlessly repetitious to again lay down a low level format of track and sector information on the drive platters. This information is already permanently available to the on-board controller by design.

had been looking for that had gone out of publication. I also got rid of all those old software/hardware items that I no longer had any use for. Buying or selling, the flea market is a really great time. Pete Goad is our flea market Guru this year. He is in charge of all those things that Fred Noble has been pulling his hair out over for the last few years. Thanks, Fred, for all the good work. Pete will be issuing information on how to turn in those items you wish to get rid of at your next chapter meeting and in the newsletter. If you have any questions, give him a call.

One last thing I'd like to remind you of are the door prizes that we give away. We have several things turned in and others on their way. I can't tell what goodies we will have, but they should be worth showing up for and winning. Well, that's all I have for now. Make plans to show up for METCOM. It will be worth your time.

## Charts &amp; Graphs

a chance to save some money by Steve Davis - The Boarding House BBS

his message is intended to be a quick look at one of the most over-hyped software packages for the Amiga. I am speaking of Charts &amp; Graphs, a program being sold to unsuspecting Amiga users who haven't heard all the details of this program yet. The cover of the instruction manual to Charts &amp; Graphs says "Professional presentation of all your business data..." Let me give you MY story and then I'll let you decide.

I purchased Charts &amp; Graphs hoping to find a serious program written with the intention of helping me create PROFESSIONAL LOOKING charts for my business. I wanted a chart program that would work with my Amiga 3000 and create the wide range of types and styles of charts that my work demands. To the best of my knowledge, this is the ONLY piece of software out for the Amiga which has these design goals in mind. Unfortunately, Charts &amp; Graphs does not live up to my expectations. Indeed, the program lacks in so many respects that I cannot explain them all in detail, given the format of this review.

I will review various topics, devoting a paragraph or so to each, and give the program's performance a grade letter from A to F, much like the American public school grading system.

Look and Feel: Charts &amp; Graphs has its own look and feel. I have not tried to run it on a 1.3 machine, but it doesn't look or behave very well on my Amiga 3000. Indeed, the manual's illustrations were taken from a 1.3 computer and it does not look much better. For one thing, it IGNORES virtually every style suggestion in Commodore's style manual. The data entry screen opens up with the same overscan settings as Workbench, for instance, but the window will only scale as wide as 640 pixels. In most (but not all) windows, buttons are INDENTED and other graphic elements are OUTDENTED. Figure that one out! Instead of CANCEL buttons on requesters, there are misleading EXIT buttons. In some requesters (but not all), there are giant UGLY headers like "***WARNING***" that are obviously made by scaling up an 8 point font. The menu colors are ORANGE on light gray. Some requesters put the OK and EXIT buttons at the TOP of the window, even though there is no real reason for them to be there. Obviously, no thought went into ergonomics, or the expectations of the end user. I can understand that programmers want to be creative, but this interface is BAD. Not good, but BAD.

For Look and Feel, I give Charts &amp; Graphs an F-! (that's F MINUS).

Ease of Use: Again, I find that this program fails. This programmer must have his own ideas about how object oriented graphics systems should work, because I have NEVER seen a program that makes simple tasks so difficult! This program's font requesters, for instance, should be nominated for the world's all-time WORST design in history. Imagine a font requestor which will ONLY search the FONTS: logical directory, does not support the new outline font technology of Amiga OS 2.04, AND only shows you a few LETTERS of the font's name! This is an accurate description of Charts &amp; Graph's font requestors! If you wanted to load the fifty point version of Letter Gothic font, you would have to search for "DierGothic.50" in the font requestor. Why? The file requesters are not only non-standard, buy also fairly difficult to use. I could go on for pages about every little feature of this product which either does not work the way you expect it to or does not work in the way it should. Many functions (such as changing the number of colors in the work screen) require that you EXIT and RESTART the program! Creating anything but the most rudimentary image in Charts &amp; Graphs is painfully difficult.

For Ease of Use, I give Charts &amp; Graphs a D! You can get an acceptable image out of it within thirty seconds of loading the program, though not until you have learned all the little quirks and hassles that you must avoid.

Output Quality: Output quality cannot be measured, and your perception of the quality of an image is tempered by what you expect to produce. To be honest, I didn't expect very high quality from Charts &amp; Graphs after seeing the advertisements, but I thought that these sample images were probably created by the programmer himself and didn't represent what someone with a strong will and artistic talent could create with the program. But, I have to report that the best output quality I have EVER achieved with this program is DISMAL. Every variable the user can set has unnecessary limits, frustrating quirks, or unexpected results. The program will let you use images larger than your computer's resolution, but the blitting functions used to make the graph often produce rectangles instead of the desired shape. The line graphs are unbelievably ugly because of the way they are drawn with two parallel lines instead of one. The pie graph can only be viewed from the "northeast" and the slices often overlap each other. Socalled 3-D graphs are often distorted, and can only be viewed from the "southeast" · The labels for each element in the X axis of a graph constantly overlap one another and the only solution (which is even in the manual) is to go into the data editor and cut out the offending labels.

For Output Quality, I give Charts &amp; Graphs a D! Yes, you can create real charts and graphs, but there are no frills. There is NO graph in Charts &amp; Graphs that can't be created (with about twice as much effort, however) in Deluxe Paint. What's missing? How about

the ability to view 3-D charts from different perspectives? The ability to import (and subsequently export) 24 bit images, or DR2D outline files? How about graduated background fills (very common in the PC market); or support for shadows, hi-lites or true outline fonts?

Documentation: In a word, presumptuous. The programmer must have written this one by himself, because there is an occasional technobabble remark used to explain away a feature which does not work well using Charts &amp; Graphs. For instance, he explains why complicated charts scale incorrectly by saying "Because the screen pixels are discreet entities (you know, quanta), the more columns we have on screen, the greater the round off error will be." The manual then launches into a four page diatribe explaining how to make a chart that is scaled incorrectly to APPEAR correct.

For Documentation, I give Charts &amp; Graphs a C. Though the book spends more time than it should with lame-brain tutorials, it does have the three qualities that I find essential: First, wire binding so it can be read flat on a table. Second, a good index. Third, intelligent font choices.

Functionality: This program crashes my Amiga 3000 constantly. It is a memory hog (especially chip RAM), since the executable is 586,424 bytes (yes, 572 kilobytes!) and takes as much as 188,000 bytes from ny system just to run. On my same hard drive, Imagine 2.0 is only nine thousand bytes larger and is one of the most diverse and powerful programs I have ever used. I haven't tried Charts &amp; Graphs on anything other than my system but it is sluggish at 25 Mhz. As mentioned earlier, the program makes plenty of scaling and position errors while calculating the graph, and really can't be trusted with anything more sophisticated than a lemonade stand's quarterly earnings report. Just the fact that it doesn't have the 2.0 look and feel ALONE indicates that the programmer is incompetent to me, since I have had 2.03 for a year and a half and 2.04 has been available to developers for over six months.

For Functionality, I give Charts &amp; Graphs a D. I reserve the F in this category for programs that don't work on my computer at all. Though this program is buggy and crash-prone, it will run. It's a lot like PageStream was before 2.0 came out. There are so many problems that I feel like a beta-tester while running the thing.

User Satisfaction: None. I am absolutely no better off having this program than I was without it. It is buggy slow, HUGE, sloppy, proprietary, ugly, over-simplified, and just doesn't perform as advertised. I believe I have found the ultimate form of copy protection: this program is SO BAD that no one in their right mind would keep TWO copies of it around. A friend wouldn't let a friend use Charts &amp; Graphs.

So, here is how the grades tally up:

For User Satisfaction, I give Charts &amp; Graphs an F. Unless there is a significant upgrade in a few months (not likely), I will delete it from my hard drive and forget that I ever thought someone would write good business software for my favorite computer.

| TOPIC             | GRADE   | VALUE     |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| Look and Feel     | F-      | 0.00      |
| Ease of Use       | D       | 1.00      |
| Output Quality    | D       | 1.00      |

| Average           |         | 0.83 or F |

In case you haven't noticed, I don't like this program. It stinks! It is lousy! It is worthless! Don't buy it! Don't steal it! Don't even demo it at your local dealer!

## Presentation Master

a professional presentation authoring system review by Mike Schwartz - Central Texas Amiga Computer Society resentation Master is described by Oxxi, Inc. as a That is exactly what it is. It is the first serious attempt that I have seen on the Amiga (or any other personal computer, for that matter) to merge the worlds of desktop video \multimedia, and powerful structure business presentation graphics in one package.

First, let's be sure we understand the difference between bitmapped graphics (what most Amiga graphics are) and Structured or Vector graphics (such as those created by Gold Disk's Professional Draw and other illustration packages). Since bitmaps are composed of a fixed array of pixels, limited by the display capabilities of the Amiga, they are inherently low resolution. Bitmaps that exceed the display resolution of the Amiga can be edited with some software and can be imported into Desktop Publishing packages, but are impractical for desktop video, since they cannot be fully displayed on screen. While bitmapped graphics are ideal for desktop presentations or for graphics destined for video tape output, they are not well suited for output to high resolution imaging devices such as film recorders (for creating color slides) or image-setting equipment (such as Linotronics) for offset reproduction. This is where structured or vector graphics come into play. Illustrations created in structured drawing packages are limited ONLY by the resolution of the device they will be output to. This is due to the fact that the component parts of the images are defined mathematically as curves and lines instead of as groups of pixels. When output to high resolution devices, structured graphics do not have the "Jaggies" associated with bitmapped graphics.

Presentation Master supports BOTH types of graphics in one program that also lets you integrate business charts and graphs from imported or entered data, run ANIMs within your presentation, access an extensive library of clip art from other platforms (IBM and MacIntosh as well as Amiga), compose your speaker notes, and create story boards to help you organize your presentation.

Editing the elements of each slide is simplified by a layering approach to allow access to certain areas of the slide for editing without affecting others. In addition to all this, Presentation Master also supports a variety of fonts including Compugraphic Intellifonts and Oxxi's own PolyText fonts, 12 of which are supplied with the program. Oxxi also supplies many pre-designed templates which can be used as is, or altered to your personal taste. Graphics formats supported include: HAM, 24-bit IFF, ANIM and Adobe Illustrator EPS (editable). Presentation Master maintains a 24-bit color palette internally (for output to devices which can support this), and can display over 30,000 colors on screen.

The structured drawing module even does automatic tweening, shape and color morphing, as well as effects such as embossing, extrusion, gradient fills and perspective. The slide sorter interface uses a very powerful hierarchical system with "hot spots" to let you jump to appropriate sections of your presentation with the touch of a button, and allows for over 40 transition effects between slides. As all programs of this nature should, Presentation Master can create standalone shows for playback on any Amiga (with 512k or more).

The manual is a refreshing change from the usual poorly-written manuals that accompany some Amiga software packages. It is a 300+ page, well organized, wellillustrated guide with loads of useful and easy-to-follow tutorials covering all aspects of the software. Also included is a "Quick Reference Guide" which helps you around the interface, shows you what the supplied fonts and templates look like, and has a list of slide output service bureaus compatible with color postscript output.

Everything I have said about Presentation MAster so far has been positive. There are some things which need to be taken into consideration before you run out and buy this software. Hardware is one of them. Presentation Master requires a hard drive and minimum of 2 MB of fast RAM in order to run. Even with this configuration, memory can be a limiting factor. More fast RAM (about 4 MB) and 1 MB or chip RAM are required to take full advantage of PM's features. I have evaluated this package on a 33 Mhz machine with a 33 Mhz co-processor and 12 MB of RAM and a 105 MB hard drive. With this configuration, Presentation Master really flies. In a lowmemory environment, Presentation Master will still run (with the minimum configuration) but it will only load what it needs as it needs it instead of loading everything into RAM... thus slowing things down somewhat.

You will also need about 10 MB free on your hard drive to install the whole program, including clip art. The install program has 3 options: Novice, Intermediate, and Expert depending on your knowledge of AmigaDOS and your desire to customize where Presentation Master keeps its files. There is even a Pretend Installation which goes through the motions without actually installing so you can see if you have all the disks, and necessary hard drive space before doing the install for real. Having worked with Presentation Master for a few weeks now, I feel that Oxxi has released a product which fills a void in the Amiga software market. It is one of the most advanced tools available in the field of Multimedia, and it was well worth the $245.00 that I paid of it. List price is $399.95.

## METCOM CLASSES

Listed below are the classes currently being planned for METCOM. These are the classes which will be held if enough members show their interest by preregistering. Each class will be limited to no more than 20 students. Enclosed in this newsletter you should find a registration form. For more information, or if your resistration form is missing, contact Harold Williams, 817-483-0537.

- ARexx - programming, using ARexx macros for controlling software, and inter-process communications.
- AmigaDOS/Workbench 2.0 - complete overview of the system software, how to modify the startup procedure, and preferences.
- CanDo - understanding the tools, how to create your own software.
- Telecommunications - modems, software, archiving/unarchiving files, and the MCCC BBS.
- Video Toaster - LightWave 3D, the switcher, the character generator.

processing, the Amiga - an upstart computer from a company that had been acquired by Commodore — was introduced. My money had been on deposit for about a month, and I was the first lucky customer to take one of these puppies home from my dealer. It cost me just about every penny I had. The CPU - with 256K of on-board memory - cost $1295. The nosepiece expander, which brought the machine up to a whopping 512K - was around $200 more.

To kick things off, Commodore had a splashy television commercial. It was weird and mystical, just like the famous Mac commercial. Unlike the Mac commercial, it ran more than just once. The major computer magazines — from Byte to

Compute - ran cover stories on this remarkable new machine. Color, speed, animation, 4-voice stereo sound, multitasking, and ease-of-use were new concepts in personal computing, especially when combined in a single, moderately-priced machine. Those of us in the know sat back smugly, knowing that we were in the vanguard of a revolution that would very soon change the face of computing.

That was then. Now, of course, things are different. Color was a long time coming to the Mac world, but it

Oh, what of the dream? It's time to face facts. Despite a growing world-wide base, the Amiga is NOT about to supplant the PC's and the Mac's in the corporate world, in the schools, or in the home. The Critical Mass that we used to speak about never arrived. Remember? Just wait until we hit the One Million mark. The developers will come crawling out of the woodwork! It didn't happen then, it didn't happen at two million, and it didn't happen at three million. While Amiga's sales increased incrementally, PC and Mac sales increased exponentially. There are, relatively speaking, fewer of us than ever.

Is this a big deal? Nope. Not unless you care about numbers. What counts is what's in front of you, how well it does what you want it to do. While it's true that we won't see anything from the Big Guys any time soon, there will always be dedicated Amiga programmers around to create the tools we need. Don't worry if some of them jump ship — there are new Amiga programmers coming aboard every day.

Right now, you can have state-of-the-art

multitasking, the fastest machine in town, 24-bit color, and an awful lot of features that owners of Other machines still covet. And, judging from the glorious colors coming out of my crystal ball, the future looks even brighter. So be one of the Few, the Proud, the Amigan... and stay tuned!

arrived with a vengeance. Multitasking, derided as useless, is now a feature (in one degree or another) in all the current operating systems. And Multimedia is the latest buzz-word. Who is leading this revolution? Big Blue and the Fruit Suits, that's who. The PC crowd, which finally has the processing as the anim format, are just as frightened, and they've joined up with the Blue team.

Our August meeting featured Aaron Lozier demonstrating software called Virtual Reality Studio. This software allows one to create worlds and then interact with them. Part of the demo was a walk through of a house with sound effects. This could be used as an aid in modeling a new house or remodeling an existing house. Additions can be made and then viewed in a solid 3D perspective. While this is true, this product will probably be used more to create new 3D interactive games easily. There are some drawbacks to the program. The first is that the objects created cannot be curved... only cubes, triangles and pyramids are used. Another is that the maximum resolution is 320 x 200 with 16 colors. The last drawback is that the sounds must be in RAW format - not IFF formats.

Announced at the meeting was that people wanting to participate in the METCOM 92 flea market need to bring their things to the September meeting or contact one of their chapter officers to make arrangements to drop off things they wish to sell. Discussions about using ARexx, high-speed modems, and PageStream were part of the questions and answers section. Mentioned in the rumor section were a possible upgrade of NewTek's Lightwave by December 1992. The new fact section brought to light that an minor upgrade of Deluxe Paint IV is out. Also mentioned was the need to contact Supra if you need a ROM upgrade for one of their new 9600 baud modems. Baud Bandit has also been upgraded to a new version.

Join us in September for more facts, rumors, answers, and fun. Don't forget about METCOM 92 coming up in October.

Well, dear friends, it was another "you shoulda been there" night, but if you HAD come you wouldn't have had a place to sit! We were temporarily in a different meeting room, and coincidentally had a very good turnout, and we almost didn't fit! We'll be back in our regular spot in September, and I hope you're all there. We'll be welcoming David Marshall and his demo of a neat 12-bit audio board (unless the 16-bit one is released by then!) In October, we'll learn about InfoChannel from Sonia King. Then in November, we have a Desktop Publishing evening planned, with several packages being presented. December (can it be in sight already?) will be our traditional games month, with munchies and family members welcome. Also at the September meeting (or rather, just before it at 6 p.m.), Dave Byrne will be offering a hands-on workshop on our own BBS. Just so we can be prepared, let me know if you plan to come and have not already indicated your interest. All are welcome!

Back to the August meeting... in addition to the usual rumors and questions, we had a peek at the State of the Art in color printing, just for our amusement and amazement, from Duane Baade of Tektronix. He showed us samples of output from his own Amiga some years ago, when their wax transfer technology was just starting out. Pretty colorful. After that, the printers advanced to 300 dots-per-inch, 8-colors, any-kindof-paper capabilities. Unfortunately, they didn't come with Amiga drivers. The latest thing, though, is the Phaser IISD model, just out in July. It uses a solid dye that is heated by the print head to create a gas. Now there are 16 million colors per dot, and the samples he passed around were like photos! The price is stiff for the average user ($9,995), but the output is phenomenal, and there will be those who feel it's cheap for what it can do for them. It supports the IBM PC and the Macintosh, but NOT the Amiga (yet?). There's a number to call for more information: 1-800835-6100. Maybe a few hints from the Amiga user base and we can add that to our already awesome arsenal of graphical miracles. Another user happened to bring a sample of the ol' Canon PJ1080A output: a pretty picture of a dolphin with layered background that was maybe 3X5 feet. Took over 4 hours to print all the pages, and another hour to tape it all together! Well, those of us without a spare $10K have to make do somehow.

Meanwhile, we heard that Dave Byrne is headed for the World of Commodore show in Pasadena (September 11-13), and will report back to us at the September meeting on what he finds there. And speaking of shows, our Danny Barnett will be going to a Horror Convention at the Dallas Hilton (October 23-25), and will show off a little musical number entitled "Chili Con Carnage" (ick!) that he composed, with his Amiga controlling the MIDI. Glad to see the Amiga and Danny in the spotlight again! More tidbytes: Tom Brooks shared rumors of a fix for the Applied Engineering high-density drive that wasn't supported under 2.0. Many things were offered for sale: a 2400 BAUD modem, the monitor being used in the upcoming demo, two small noisy children (yes, mine), and a handful of other things. No better place to find a new home for your old whatsit than a room full of other whatsit-users! (Save up some for the METCOM flea market in October, though!) By the way, we are sold out of the leftmouse-button replacements we got months ago. Must have been a badly needed item for many. We honored the author of LHA, the archiving program that "squishes files real

At last our presentation: John Chang of The Edge brought us a couple of neat demonstrations. First, we got to see OctaMED 3.0 Professional, the latest and greatest of the MED line. Right now, it's only available in England, and John is trying to bring several copies over for us. The new release is VERY complete, and that makes it more complex than some of the other music programs around. But the music it produces is incredible! It can produce 8channel output WITH oUT the MIDI, just driving the Amiga like crazy. It now has notational entry and display of the music, for those who want to see the score. There are lots of music files out there in PD, and you can bring your disks up to

your music collection.

The second part of John's presentation has an interesting background. It seems that pirating has become something of an art in Europe. A game obtained from a questionable source may boot up with a flashy introduction or demo inserted by the guy that cracked its copy protection. You know, "This bootleg software brought to you courtesy of Black Jack Savage", etc. These intros became fancier and more elaborate until they became an art form unto themselves. No longer content to show off their Amiga skills hidden in other people's code, the pirate groups began to compete and even write legit games that were called "Hardwired" and the "Phenomena Demo". I loved "Phenomena" with its awesome 3D graphics, surrealistic landscape tours, etc. Both of these programs ended up crashing on us, but not before really wowing the crowd. It's not surprising that they are unstable: these maverick programmers start with everything labeled in the manual "Don't Ever Do This:" and find ways to get the Amiga to outperform itself in every aspect of its capabilities. You gotta see it to believe it! There are several multidisk demos available. Check with John next time you're at The Edge for the restrictions and warnings and how-tos, then enjoy the show. We

The Edge and John will share them with you. (Players available, too.) Tom Brooks also has access to a conversion program to carry SMUS files to the STM (Sound Tracker Module) format, in case you want to unify outstanding examples of the Amiga's best tricks in graphics, etc. (One example of this is the Pinball Dreams simulation, with great graphics and motion.) SO, what John brought us was a sampling of the best, a demo

Last but not least, we had a gaggle of doorprizes. Three were from a generous member who didn't hang around to be thanked, and didn't write down his name so Henry could remember it. Thanks so much, Mysterious Stranger! He brought us a Buck Rogers T-shirt (won by Don Sobieck), a copy of Air Strike (won by William Dockendorf), and The Keys

The Edge brought us Civilization (look out, Eric Watson, it's addictive!) and as a special treat, back issues of European Amiga magazines (most with disks) for EVERYBODY THERE. Thanks again, to all! See you next month.

for recording and playing back the audio captured. Sample audio clips were played for everyone's amusement. If you are interested in this digitizer package, let me know and I'll try to get you in touch with the right folks.

## Arl/Grand Prairie Brad Dumler

At the August meeting, our chapter got a great deal of info from our President, Foster McCowan, on some new developments in the world de mise mour 8: bit marmints is shil greatly exaggerated. It was brought to everyone's attention that the beloved C64 has reached the age of 10 years old since its introduction. Quite a respectable milestone in these times of such rapid technological advancement and technical obsolescence. We heard a rumor of possible development of a CD-ROM drive by a well-known C64/C128 hardware developer. Be watching out also for a new GEOS graphics application that will offer full-color 80-column capability for C128 users. Also, be sure to take a look at the September/October RUN magazine for an article by Foster about a shareware GEOS application. How fortunate we are to have a published author in our midst.

One of our members brought a new C128 audio digitizer program called Zounds to show us. The digitizer package was created by Mike Neus, a C128 enthusiast in Dallas. This digitizer package includes a schematic for building the audio digitizer cartridge to record sounds, and the associated software as a cheat-sheet.

We plan to see and discuss C64 and C128 word processors at the September meeting. We will meet at the Grand Prairie Public Library as usual. Remember also that our chapter workshops are held at this library location. Check the Calendar of Events here in the newsletter for the particulars.

## Fort Worth Mary Louise Hagemeyer

For a while we thought we would have to hold our meeting in the lobby, because somebody else was using our room, but a security guard kindly opened another room for us. If you ever arrive for a Fort Worth meeting and don't find it, just look for a note on the door.

John Burt opened the meeting with "Elvis Tribute" , complete with picture, as performed by Sid Player 10.3 and downloaded from Q-Link. He followed this with a compatibility test, a biorhythm printer, a detective program called The Panther — the butler was guilty - and a "Wheel of Fortune" type of program called Word Guess. Keeping up with current events, John demonstrated The Games, a commercial program from Epyx with good sound and graphics in which the user can compete in many Olympic events and perhaps wear out a joystick or two.

One of our members had had trouble with an ARC file, so we had a demonstration of how to use OmegaQ II. Brenda Sessums had brought a copy of Luscher Profile by Mindscape, a series of color and pattern preference tests that produces a personality analysis.

Next month Brenda is going to show how she uses GEOS on a C64 with RAM expansion. All you GEOS users, plan to be there and share your expertise. The meeting will be Saturday, September 12, 1:30 p.m., in Room 540 at TCOM.

We finally had our program on the C128 features and capabilities at the July chapter meeting. I got to be the featured speaker. Quite a few of our members in attendance are users of the C128, so some of the discussion may have been a repeat of things they already knew. But I tried to point out some of the not-so-common · information that I hoped to make everyone aware of. To help me through the presentation, I used a couple of interactive demonstration programs that are available in our club library. One is called "basic7.0 demo.40" and is — guess what - a description and demonstration of some of the commands unique to BASIC 7.0 in the C128. The other is aptly titled "esc code demo.40" and it shows all of the ESCape key functions built into C128s. Both demos run in 40-column mode. Unfortunately, I don't know which library disk these programs can be found on. I acquired them on a disk of utility programs that was put together for METCOM a couple of years ago. Your librarian might be able to help you locate them. I highly recommend that you take a look at these if you missed the July meeting. Even if you have been using your C128 for a long time, you might be reminded of some interesting things that will make your computing time more enjoyable and/or more productive. It did me a lot of good to refresh my memory about all of the wonderful capabilities just waiting at my fingertips. You might also want to refer to a programming reference guide for additional documentation of the various BASIC 7.0 and ESCape commands. I find it very helpful to keep a copy of the ESCape key commands beside my system to use
