## Out Of This World

Yes, it is by Bill Raecke ut Of This World is a new game from Interplay. I read a couple of glowing reviews and decided that I would give it a try. I haven't been disappointed. In fact, I may be addicted. To begin with, the graphics are so stunning as to set a new standard for this type of game. And the game play is entertaining and challenging as well. But, as usual, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start back at the beginning.

fact that it is hard-drive installable. Interplay gets one black mark. The good news is that the game is MUCH better than the hard drive installation procedure.

What you get when you buy Out Of This World is two disks, a code wheel and a very small instruction booklet. The disks are unprotected and the game is hard-drive installable. The only protection is by way of the code wheel... my favorite game protection method. There is a problem with the hard drive installation procedure, however. For someone familiar with the Amiga things can be worked through — but for those who are still learning, the instructions are rather vague. There is no installation script. The instructions simply state that the files should be copied to a directory on the hard disk. They provide no help as to how that should be done. Worse yet - the instructions then state to select the icon of the file containing the game and "click the Start icon twice" There is no Start icon. In fact, there is no icon at all. There is a "read.me" file on the disk but it is little help (and there is no icon for it either). For the record, all that needs to be done is to copy the contents of both disks to the same directory on the hard drive. The game can then be started from the Shell by changing the current directory to the directory containing the game ("CD volume:directory") and then typing the command "Another" · If you wish to start the game from the Workbench (as most probably will) it's a little more complicated. You can use the standard icon editor to build an icon — but the game must be run from the Shell... so the icon must be a project icon that runs IconX or Icond which in turn runs the game for you. This is far more complicated than it needs to be. What it means is that many people will run the game from floppies despite the

\ o what kind of game is it, you may be asking. It's a · little difficult to describe. It's part adventure, part puzzle and part action game. First, the scenario. The story line in Out Of This World is established via a rather lengthy animation when the program first boots up. Considering the quality of this animation, this is a tremendous step up from the usual description in the instruction manual (that most of us by-pass anyway). The animation is rendered in real-time using the same kind of vector animation used in flight simulators... except that the graphics employed here are much more detailed than that seen in most simulators. The advantage is that a great deal of animation information can be stored in very little disk space. And the result is that your socks hit the wall and your jaw gets scuff marks from hitting the floor. This is knockout stuff! The story is that you are a scientist, working late at night, running an experiment with an atomic particle accelerator. As the experiment proceeds, a thunderstorm develops outside and at the most inopportune moment a lightning bolt strikes the lab. The massive jolt of electricity interacts with the particle accelerator establishing an unknown reaction that sends you, the scientist, into another world. Your job - to survive.

And survival won't be easy. When the game proper begins you find yourself materializing in a pool of water with your computer desk. Moments later you will perish as tentacles rise from the bottom of the pool, grab you, and pull you to your doom. You will then be shown a screen that tells you to click to continue and you are given a code. This is the code that lets you by-pass the opening sequence on subsequent boots. It is also the code that will let you resume playing in the sequence where you left off — you don't have to start at the beginning each time (the

code changes as you progress through the game). So, one click and you're back in the game. This time you're smart enough to push up on the joystick to swim to the top of the pool and escape the rising tentacles. You will find yourself on a strange planet with two moons hovering low on the horizon in the late afternoon light. There are steep cliffs to the left. Birds can be seen flying in the background. And if you look quickly you will see that you have been noticed by a large, black, cat-like creature which glares at you with red eyes from a rock in the near background, and which then turns and runs off to the right. Time to look around. Actually, it may be past time because you will discover that if you linger too long near the pool a tentacle will reach out, find you, and drag you back in. Moving to the left will bring you to a steep dropoff. Just out of reach is a rope or vine hanging in a loop from some point above. Alternately, moving to the right of the pool will bring you to a covered walkway. And black, slug-like creatures about six inches in length are falling from the walkway's cover. They crawl upside down on the cover, fall, and then continue to crawl toward you. Proximity will reveal that they possess a single poisonous fang which will reacquaint you with the "click to continue" screen. Beyond the slug-like creatures, further to the right, you will get a closer look at the cat-like creature you noticed in the distance earlier. It will be a quick look.

So, that's the first puzzle. You've got a sharp drop-off to the left, poisonous slugs and a downright scary catcreature to the right, and a pool in the middle that will take care of you even if you don't move. How do you get out? You really don't expect me to say do you? But that should give you an idea of what the game is like. When you do make it though the first problem, you will find yourself in another predicament. Each time it will be a combination of joystick dexterity and logic that will get you through. The joystick work can be challenging but it shouldn't be beyond most people's capabilities. By the way, the entire game is controlled by joystick. With it you can walk, run, jump, kick, fire a weapon, pick up an object and, in some cases, go up or down. The controls are logical and very easy to get used to.

As mentioned before, Out Of This World is a beautiful game. The vector graphics used in the opening animation are retained throughout - and the accompanying sounds and occasional music are just the right touch. But the makers didn't stop with a game that merely looks good. It plays well, too. I can't recommend this one too highly. You need to check it out.

## PageStream v2.2

## How to set the screen colors From the Soft-Logik Support BBS

here still continues to be some confusion over made in PageStream 2.2 in the way that it matches colors in the color palette to the screen colors. First some things you must know:

- Every color palette contains black and white.
- Gray screen color (for the purposes of this discussion) is any screen color with EQUAL amounts of Red, Green and Blue. ie, all three sliders in the "Change Screen Colors" requester lined up.
- PgS 2.2 uses the first two and the last two screen colors for the page, the hilites, menus, requesters, option selected colors... etc.
- PgS 2.2 matches the White objects up to the lightest "gray" screen color.
- PgS 2.2 matches the Black objects up to the darkest "gray" screen color.
- IF there is only one "gray" color in the screen colors, then both Black objects (normally text), and White objects (the page) map to this color.

If you start Pg$2.2 without a PSPrefs file, it will use the standard WB2 screen colors. If you do not have a flicker fixer, then you know that the Black and White objects next to each other can be quite a visual distraction. What some folks have done because of the flicker, or just because they wanted different colors, is change the colors to something else which they find more pleasing. Whether this is a leftover PgS2.1 PSPrefs file, or a changed PgS 2.2 WB2 screen colors, if they have less than two "gray" colors by the above definition, they have both Black and White mapping to the same screen color. This means that text will not be visible on the page! If there is only one "gray" and it is 100% White, then the page and the TEXT will be white. If the only "gray" is totally Black, then the text and the Page will be black! This is the way it is supposed to work! It's NOT broken. Please tell anyone who is reporting a Black page, or if text does not show up on screen, to make sure that they have at least TWO "gray" screen colors by the above definition.

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

A migaus 4. goodies It's a good month for those who have upgraded to AmigaOS 2.0. (Those who haven't should do so as soon as possible.) Some of these have been available on the club BBS and are finally making it into the library — others are upgrades to things you may already have - still others are brand new.

On the same disk is RBlank by Brian C. Berg. If you're like me, you have a number of screen blankers that you like and can't decide which one to run. RBlank provides the answer. Simply add RBlank to your userstartup file (it's an ARexx program) and it will choose a random blanker from those available and move it to your WBStartup drawer before Workbench is loaded. That way the blanker used will vary with each boot of the system. All you need to do to set it up is to put all of your blankers in a directory by themselves, modify the ARexx program to tell it the name of the directory where the blankers are, and then add RBlank to your user-startup as mentioned before. And then be surprised.

On MCCC-A \_ 380 is a nifty screen blanker called ASwarm by Markus Illenseer. When enabled, the "swarm" consists of a short white line being chased around the screen by a set of colored lines. You get to control how many of these "swarms" appear (1 to 10) and how many "bees" there are per swarm (1-100). It's an unusual blanker and worth adding to your collection.

One more important program on this same disk (this is really a great disk) is ToolManager by Stefan Becker. You may already have this program because it's been on the MCCC SuperDisks for a couple of months already but if you don't it's high time you got it. ToolManager is one of those programs that should have been included with the Amiga. With it you can add ANY program you want to the AmigaOS 2.0 "Tools" menu. Programs can be added simply by dropping them in the open ToolManager window or by typing them in. Programs can be run as if they had been run from Workbench (all the tooltypes and the stack size from the icon will be used) - or they can be run as if from the Shell... in which case parameters can be passed as well. Hot keys of your choice can be established to run any of them without the use of the mouse. In fact, you can establish a program to be run at the touch of a hot-key and NOT have it show up on the "Tools" menu. If you add more programs than a menu can normally handle, ToolManager will automatically establish a second column of programs from the same menu. System enhancement utilities don't come any better than this. My one complaint? I'd like to be able to tell it when to start that second column (or third... or fourth) instead of having such a long single column. A small complaint.

Of course, what AmigaOS 2.0 user isn't looking for more icons? After all, we have that GREAT-LOOKING interface. And we have the ability to make it an eightcolor or sixteen-color Workbench as well. Of course, adding extra colors to the Workbench does little to improve things unless you have colorful icons to use those extra colors. On MCCC-A \_ 385 is a large collection of eight-color icons designed for an interlaced screen.

## ClipArt

Not only is it a good month for 2.0 users, it's a bonus month for ClipArt freaks as well. On MCCC-A 383 is a collection of 38 clips in PCX format. On MCCC-A\_384 you'll find 41 more. And on MCCC-A\_385 there are another 21. The PCX format pretty much limits it to PageStream users — but that's probably most of us anyway, isn't it? Of course if you have Art Department Professional you can always convert them to IFF format for use in other programs. Anyway, these clips are well worth looking at.

## PageStream 2.2HL &amp; HP500C driver by Soft-Logik

For PageStream users who happen to own a new HP DeskJet 500C, Soft-Logik has released a new version of the print driver for that printer. You'll find it on MCCCA - 390.

Yes, PageStream! I thought that would get your attention. No, we haven't gone crazy. You can't get a copy of PageStream from the club library. What you CAN get is a patch that will upgrade your PageStream 2.2 to the newer 2.2HL version. This is a patch distributed by SoftLogik that fixes a couple of bugs and adds a couple of new features. It also makes the program compatible with the new HotLinks software that links PageStream to its companion products (hence the 2.2HL designation). I'm still waiting for my copy of HotLinks - but at least I'm ready when it gets here. The PageStream 2.2HL patch is on MCCC-A 389.

## Virus\_Checker 6.01 by John Veldthuis

For those of you who are new to the club and to the Amiga, let me just say that you should check every disk you bring into your home for viruses. That includes software you purchase at your local dealer. Better safe

than sorry. Let me add that the best way to check your disks for viruses and eliminate them is with Virus\_ Checker. The program is easy to compréhensive (it checks for all known viruses), ased reliable. This is the latest version, 6.01, and if you don't have it, you should. This is your chance. It's on MCCCA 389.

## Games

What month would be complete without a couple of good games. The first is Poing by Paul van der Valk. Poing is a kind of "breakout", but with a difference. In his one the paddle is on the lett hand sıde oi the scree. nd the blocks are on the right. The layouts are fresh an imaginative... and you'll find a number of surprises along the way. Poing is very nicely done with beautiful graphics and nice sound -— and the action is very smooth. All this in a program that is only 32K in length. Quite remarkable. And by the way, it multitasks, too. Be sure not to miss this one. It's on MCCC-A\_390.

The second game of the month is Centipede by Glenn M. Lewis. It's a new version of the classic shoot-'em up. It's nicely done (although not nearly as nicely done as Poing) and well worth checking out. This one is also one of those games that is amazingly small — only 31K. It's on MCCC-A\_391.

## Meet The People Who Work For You

Name: Mark Henry

Age: 29 going on 65

Hobbies: Amigas, gaming, rafting, looking for low prices, and wishing for more free time

Mark's first real introduction into computers was in 1976. He an a friend bought an H-89 computer kit from Heath Corp. and built the thing in 3 days. Amazingly, it worked the first time it was powered up. Since that time, computers have never left Mark's life.

In 1979 Mark assisted in instructing his High School computer class. That class used the Commodore PET! (the C64 wasn't even available in the market, and NO ONE imagined that something like the AMIGA was only 5 years away.)

In 1982 Mark joined the Navy as a Data Processing Technician, and worked with several maintrame computer systems, expanding his knowleage or computers. Mark worked in both the Supply and Intelligence Divisions on the Aircratt Carier U.S.s: Saratoga. Mark gleaned all the knowledge he could from the Supply Division. (Punched Cards, magnetic Drums, MASS data storage and retrieval and sorting techniques and the like

While in the Intel Division, he learned even more about computer security and safeguarding. By this time his training was considerable and he was used as an instructor by the Navy to train other personnel aboard the ship.

## Meet The People Who Work For You

(continued trom page 1)

In 1985 his ship-board duty done, he was stationed at New Orleans Naval Airstation and was given the assignment of being the Special Assistant to the Commanding Officer as a Computer Security Instructor. He also provided training to all base personnel on IBM desktop compatibles. In 1987 Mark left the Navy to pursue a civilian career in computers.

After returning to Dallas, Mark worked for a short while for Computer Age. They were an Amiga dealership that lett the Dallas area shortly atterwards. In late 198/ Mark started working for Southern Technologies, a world wide distributor of Amiga product, as a sales Representative. Southern was the ONLY Amiga specific Distributor. During this time, Mark again absorbed as much as he could about the AMIGA computer systems. He was able to meet and deal with Amiga dealers and manufacturers nation-wide.

After Southern, Mark spent a short period of time helping to start up what is currently Preferred Technologies. He then spent a little over a year in the IBM world working specifically with High end telecommunications equipment.

When Mark learned of the EDGE Computer &amp; Video, he virtually threw himself at the people putting the store together. He saw it as an opportunity to finally set himself solidly in the AMIGA marketplace. Mark is a strong supporter of the AMIGA computer system and all that it can do. He has been a user, distributor, manutacturer, and salesman ot AMIGA tor 6 years now. He says that all the varied experiences he has had, has given him a unique view of the Amiga marketplace overall, and maintains his understanding of users problems and questions.

## One Road to Tranquility

Creating TranquilVision

From the newsletter of the Catalina Commodore Computer Club ou've heard of television and you've heard of AmigaVision. Well, now there's Tranquilvision, an Amiga-generated video for relaxation and meditation.

TranquilVision is the newest brainchild of Human Services Institute, Inc., a Florida-based publishing house producing books and videos for therapists and institutions dealing with substance abuse/addiction/recovery. By branching out into TranquilVision they are hoping to capture a new audience: people who want to alleviate stress using relaxation techniques, but who need visual stimulus to keep and direct their attention. Although there are already similar products on the market, they mostly rely on live nature scenes for graphics and sound. Because TranquilVision is totally computer-generated, it has the ability to take nature and expand it from the real to the imaginary. The Amiga, with its video, graphics, and music capabilities, is the ideal computer for such a project.

TranquilVision will consist of three videos: Earth is primarily a relaxation exercise for people who are closely connected to reality; Outer Space takes the viewer a step beyond this reality to faraway and imaginary places; Inner Space explores our individual realities through mandalatype images and abstractions. As a set they are designed to lead the user from simple relaxation/stress-reduction techniques to deeper, more personal meditations.

I became involved in TranquilVision through my son, Bernie Joiner, who handles the videography for HSI. Bernie and I both have similarly equipped A-2000 systems and, although he lives in Escondido, CA and I live in Tucson, AZ, we collaborate easily via GEnie, voice-phone and express mail. I generate the graphics; CCCC member Howard Wooten creates the music on his A-500 MIDI system; Bernie's wife, Dr. Linda Vickerman, writes and performs the accompanying narrations. Bernie puts it all together and creates the titling sequences.

While creating the graphics for Earth, I used a variety of programs and techniques: for animations, Deluxelaint IIl; for digitizing, DigiView 4.0; for palette manipulation, Butcher and Photon Paint 2.0; for scripting, Deluxe Video Ill and The Director. The basis for Earth is a series of photographs I took on a trip to western New York State last October. These were digitized as overscan HAM+ images using DigiView 4.0. Those images which transferred well were also converted to 16-color hires overscan mode. Using examples from The Director disks and adapting the built-in scripts, I set up two slideshow sequences. The first consists of realistic HAM images that lead into a DPaint IIl animation of raindrops on a mirrored pond. The second is a series of slow dissolves, using many of the same images but employing a less realistic common palette, adding an abstract, dreamy quality to the transitions.

Earth contains three animations. The opening shot shows a small blinking star, which becomes a revolving image of Earth as it moves toward the viewer until it fills the whole screen. Digitized from a NASA photo, this image of Earth as seen from Apollo 11 was put into 16color hires interlace overscan mode in DigiView 4.0. Using DeluxePaint III, I changed the palette to match a view of willow trees in filtered sunlight. Deluxe Video III proved to be the best vehicle for displaying the opening animation and wiping to the willow trees. By using "move to" I was able to zoom in on a smaller screen, and then use the "scroll" function to create motion. Using this technique on a still picture of a creek almost creates the feeling of flowing water, and if you have to be memoryconscious, the "scroll" command uses less than the "move to" command.

The "raindrops" animation began with a tutorial in the DPaint manual (Chapter Eight: Animation Effects Expanding Circles, p.143). I created an animated brush from the resulting animation, then used the perspective command to tilt the brush on the z axis until it resembled thee pattern a raindrop might make as it landed in a pool of water. An unexpected bonus occurred when altering the perspective making the overall effect even more realistic. Using this basic brush, I created three different animated raindrop brushes by changing the number of frames, varying the speed (frames/second), and then animpainting in layers (i.e. holding the animbrush in one position while it cycles past he beginning and starts to paint a second image at a different starting point). A final improvement arose from discovering that combining two different colors (one light, one dark) in each raindrop animbrush created an effect of light and shadow and added to the realism. Each of these animbrushes was then pasted down to create three raindrops on a pond. For the background screen I digitized a slightly out-offocus closeup of a highly mirrored pond surface by moving the camera near enough to the picture to achieve the effect I wanted.

→ Page 11

The third animation, "starwindow", was created by cutting a rectangular brush from the center of the final scene, a peaceful view across a placid lake. On a separate screen the brush was animated to revolve 360 degrees on a central vertical axis, much like a revolving door. With DPaint's "Move" requester it's simple to create stunningly effective animations like this, where perspective causes the image to grow larger as it approaches and smaller as it recedes, and where a 180 degree turn displays a perfect reverse image of the brush. Memory limitations (1 meg chip RAM, 2 meg fast RAM) caused my only problems. By trial and error I found the largest possible brush I could

## Changing Light Bulbs In A Litigious Society

by R. U. Awake, Esa. from The Inns of the Court BBS, Omaha, Nebraska (593-1192)

: How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?

A: Such a number may be deemed to perform the stated task in a timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement:

Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "The Lawyer" , and the party of the second part, also known as "The Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the font (north) door, through the entry way, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.

1) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (Lawyer) with every possible caution by the party of the first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.

The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:

2) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local and federal statues.

3) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part ("New Light Bulb"). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being nonnegotiable.

Note: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as "The Firm".

use and still create as many frames as I wanted for smooth animation. Before pasting this animbrush over the "window" cut from the center of the lake, I made another animbrush of twinkling starts on a black background. I pasted this down inside the "window", then laid the "revolving door" animbrush over it, so it exactly matched up with the picture from which it had been cut. When the window is closed, it's invisible. As it revolves, it reveals the glittering stars behind it.

The nice thing about a project like this is the way it forces you out of your normal routines. The programs I used are all old stand-bys. I've had them a long time. Trying to actualize my ideas caused me to learn new ways of using the same old programs. And guess what? I haven't even scratched the surface of what these programs and my Amiga are capable of. It's true what they say: the only limitation is your own imagination.

Howard Wooten's original MIDI music and Linda Vickerman's evocative narration set the mood. Bernie's titling effects with ProVideo Post add the finishing touch.

Let's see. For our next video I'm imagining HAM animations with SpectraScope, scripting with AmigaVision, ShowMaker and the new Director, maybe some special effects with the Video Toaster...

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-loop Pete Goad

The March Amiga By-The-Loop meeting, at the North Richland Hills Community Center, was moved to a different part of the center at the last minute. In fact, we ended up in one of the Centers' Court Rooms, complete with Judge's bench and gavel!

The turnout for this meeting was smaller than last month's, but 30 plus people found there way to this temporary locale. (We should be back in our usual meeting room next month). Our President, David Owens, brought the meeting to order and highlighted several of the events that are upcoming: for example, the Spring Thing at Grapevine Lake in May and the various SIG meetings that are planned. There then followed a Garage Sale by many members buying, swapping and exchanging a variety of Amiga products. (It pays to bring items to the meetings. Members like to see the merchandise!!). David then handed over the meeting to Scott Lamb and his CDTV.

The Court Room turned out to be an excellent meeting place due to the PA system that is an integral part of the room. For Scott's presentation using a CDTV, everyone present could not only see the video, but also hear the audio.

Scott brought along a Beta copy of VidDISC (Video Interactive Discoveries DISC). This is Merit Software's interactive multimedia applications environment designed specifically for CDTV. Scott then let the VidDISC demonstrate Commodore's CDTV including how the user can interact with it. The VidDISC had a variety of material on it from Point of sale systems, Preflight check for a Lear Jet, Amon Carter Museum to a slide show, all with multi-lingual audio tracks and amazing graphics. The system that was used to prepare this CD is being marketed by Merit Software and includes a fully integrated system consisting of not only Software but also the Hardware. There is no possible way I can do justice (no Pun intended?) to the tremendous demonstration given by Scott, not withstanding the 540 MBytes of data stored on a CD. The amazing things that can be done with CDTV have to be seen and heard in person to fully understand the capabilities and potential of this system. Our thanks go to Scott for an excellent evening.

To finish the evening off, Ansoft Data Systems donated the door prizes of some Free VHS Video rentals (thanks Ansoft). The first name out of the Hat was Charles Morpheus, the second name was Chris Scheers who declined since he only has a Beta machine, the other prize went to Ray Drum. Congratulations to all our winners.

The Loop chapter hopes to see you all at our next meeting in April.

## Amiga Central Ray Howard

The March Central meeting was kicked off by Harold Williams announcing that the April Central meeting will be held on the 4th Thursday of April due to a scheduling conflict at the Arlington Community Center. The date of the April meeting is April 23rd, so mark those calendars. The question and answer session covered topics from expanding to 2M of chip ram to using Directory Opus and CanDo.

Jim O'Flarity INOVAtronics was there to present their first hardware product... the HiQ A500 Tower. The HiQ will allow the A500 to utilize an Amiga 2000 style accelerator card, video card, up to 4 Zorro II cards, and 3 PC BridgeBoard slots (1 XT, 2 AT). The tower case comes with a 250 watt power supply, fan, and all cables needed for the

Next month, Adam Hill will be showing us how to use the Super JAM and Bars &amp; Pipes Professional to create great sound from the Amiga. See you on the 4th Thursday in April. Don't forget the date change.

A500. There is room for 10 halfheight drives and an extra fan. The A500 motherboard and floppy drive is mounted in the tower case. The motherboard is inserted into the tower. And the keyboard is mounted in a separate provided case. INOVAtronics has tested the HiQ with the Video Toaster, GVP boards, CBM boards, and most major hard drive controllers to ensure compatibility with the Zorro II standard. The system shown had a GVP 33Mhz accelerator card w/40M hard drive and 2 floppies. Thanks to Jim and INOVAtronics for the early glimpse at the soon to be released HiQ tower.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Here we go again with another month's lengthy notes. A lot seems to go on at our gatherings that's worth repeating! We heard bits and pieces about hardware for sale, bridgeboard problems and IBM stuff, and an update on the advertised-butnot-seen AMAX IIt Macintosh emulator (which is having patent conflicts involving the disk hardware). Isn't it interesting how many of us have at least one other computer besides our Amiga? And you can almost always find somebody else in the club with a gadget like yours to share your problems and discoveries. Gamers: look for Enchanted Realms magazine for hints, walk-thrus, etc. on your favorite passion (such as Shadow of the Beast). Member Tom Brooks showed off a cable he's devised to use an IBM-bus mouse on the Amiga... he was going to offer to make them for anyone who was interested, but

decided it was a PAIN, so his arm will need to be seriously twisted to get one (but he'll guide you in making one for yourself). Commodore tidbytes: Amiga sales have reached 3 million as of 11/91 (from 2 million 11/90, one million 3/89, begun in 9/85)! Seems 30,000 of those were CDTVs, and 85% of the Amigas have been sold in Europe, where they hold a large share of the market. Rumors: a few shareholders met in the Bahamas, and asked the chairman why Amigas were not being advertised more. Reason: customers can't find the stores that sell them! Hmmm. Good news: a possible 3rd Generation Amiga in '93. Bad news: they may be dropping UNIX. Wilder rumors: the A600. The A1500. The A5000. If you want details on these rare beasties, come next month and ask the rumormongers. Here's a note from the Edge: their BBS is up on new software, improving up-time, but is running 2400 BAUD only. They're planning another flea market in April. Speaking of flea markets, we'll have a table set up at meetings for used-software-for-sale between members.

do need two pieces of hardware: a 25-pin cable with all 25 pins running through it and an "edited" genderchanger connector. Doc files on the disk will help you make one, or Brett can make one for $5 for materials. (Intercable also makes them, we are told.) A boot disk may be used to start up the "host" system, or an already-booted system may be brought up with a startup-icon as host or guest. It doesn't matter who is who... Brett was running a CDTV under 1.3 and an A2500 under 2.0 and they communicated fine. The startup procedure asks if this system is host or guest. (If you answer no to both, then it'll ask "Why are you here???") Once ParNet is initiated, a new icon appears on the Workbench

Brett Hester provided our March demo, an update to the ParNet demo he presented some time ago. ParNet is a parallel networking package written by the famous Matt Dillon, which ties two Amigas together and allows each to access the other's devices (disk, etc.). As it comes, a lot of factors are assumed (a hard drive present, and "lots of other stuff"), and a variety of files need to be in specific directories, etc. to make it fly. Brett has designed icons and scripts that "pull it all together" and make things easy to install and use. Look in our library for ParBench 3.0, an update to Brett's old ParBench release. (Should be there soon... he's trying to CanDo-ize it, and had a bit of trouble making it portable.) Everything you need to set up a pair of Amigas in a network is on the library disk. You

screen: "Network". Clicking that opens a door to the devices on the other system. You will see an icon there for each non-write-protected device, and you may read, write, copy to/from, etc. those devices as though they were local to your machine. To access files by name, you would need to say "Net:diskid/filename". Under 2.0, you can copy files from one system to another, and CLI and Diskmaster recognize the NET: label. You can even run programs on "Amiga-1" loaded directly from storage on "Amiga-2", , but as Brett

There were over 50 folks around (and some new members: welcome!!!) waiting for the doorprizes: The Edge brought us Blockout and Drakkhen, and Floppy Joe's offered Populous. There were also several of the "Revolution" Toaster demo videos, which are well worth the watching. Next month we are hoping to hear about tape backup and SCSI devices, and perhaps have a guest from INOVAtronics. Watch the BBS or check with the Pres for final details, or just join us and see!

put it, "If you can't run the program, you still can't run the program"... the system executing the code still needs to have the memory, operating system level, etc. required for the program you are trying to run, whether the machine it was stored on could run it or not. (Sorry if that's confusing. I knew what I meant when I wrote it, anyhow.) Warning: one system or the other being down does not cause a problem UNLESS you try to access it across the net... then you crash. Since Brett had a bit of space left on his library disk and a good (if wierd) sense of humor, he added his SoundFX utility, which lets you connect a sound file to any event, such as a keystroke or diskready interrupt. So we get an Amiga that sounds like an old-fashioned typewriter when you hit the keys (try leaving it innocently running when a fellow Amiga user drops by...), with an authentic carriage-return sound, "boing" for spaces, and "boom!" for backspaces. His function keys cough and sneeze... Only on an Amiga, folks, is this miracle possible! Anyhow, a simple ASCII file ties the sounds to the events, and you can play to your heart's content (or to your family's distraction!)

well as the regular group that meets. It's nice to see new or visiting members from other chapters at our Amiga West gathering each month.

We hope to see you on the second Thursday of each month at TCCOM, 7:30 p.m. 'til when we're all tired.

The topic and demonstration for the evening was presented by Jack Smith and Robert Carroll. The topic: "Using your cellular phone in conjunction with the Amiga and Modem". Jack hooked his cellular phone up via a Datajack interface which plugs inline from the phone to his modem and then to the Amiga. Robert and Jack tried several times to log onto the MCCC BBS but the line was constantly in use. They also tried to ring up other area boards to no avail. Needless to say we didn't see the configuration do its stuff but the idea behind the ability to use a cellular phone with your modem will save many people money on long distance calls to BBS's that would otherwise be too expensive to call on your in house direct line phone. The interface is the Datajack by Cellabs - a very nifty piece of hardware.

## Arl/Grand Prairie Brad Dumler

Despite some crossed wires somewhere along the line concerning our program presentation for the night, we had a vigorous meeting in March at the Grand Prairie Public Library. We didn't have a prepared program so we had some interesting discussions about our hardware and software. We welcomed another enthusiastic new member to our humble little group. The topic for April's meeting will be the one that was scheduled for March - C128specific capabilities and usage. And don't forget the Saturday workshop on April 11th at Blake and Dorothy Brown's home. Call 214 641-0424 if you need directions or further information.

I briefly talked about my 1750 REU which I recently had upgraded from 512K to 1 Meg. I had read several good things about a fellow that would do the upgrade job for $60. So I sent my REU, a check, and a blank disk to Raymond J. Day on a Monday by Priority Mail. I got it back on the following Monday, ready to go. On the disk were some notes and technical information about the details of performing the upgrade; upgraded GEOS 64 and 128 CONFIGURE programs that take advantage of up to 2 Meg REUs; new versions of RAMDOS software for mega-ramdisks; and some other utilities for checking and testing all the memory in the REU. Raymond installs a slide switch to disable the extra memory to prevent conflicts with some programs, and a pair of LEDs that supposedly indicate which part of the memory is being accessed. You have to dig into the text files and diagrams (most are GEOS-format) to decipher the meaning of these lights though. He doesn't really give you any instructions or much help in getting this souped-up box to work with your programs. I guess it is assumed that if you know what you are doing by getting it expanded, you will be able to figure out how to use it. There is help out there for you, but it isn't just handed to you. Although I haven't had time to put it through a lot of testing, it seems to work like a charm. I've even come up with a nifty way to use that memory for making a 1581 disk copy in a single pass. I recommend Raymond's workmanship to anyone who thinks they need to have more RAM in their REU. He can be contacted at 9601 Morton Taylor Road, Belleville, MI 48111-1328, 313 699-6727; or on Qlink as RaymondD2. Perhaps at some upcoming chapter meeting I'l get a chance to show what a megaREU can do.

Hope to see you at the April meeting and workshop!

## Fort Worth

Julia Sookma

Well, our first meeting at ICOM had a great turn out. For those of you who haven't heard, we are now meeting at TCOM in room 540. This will be our regular meeting spot from now on.

Our vice-president, John Burt, demonstrated several programs. They were: Tetris (from public domain), Speed Script 128, Medicaid (which can diagnose and offer firstaid treatment), and Little Computer. Jonathan Orr, son of Joe Orr showed us a disk that he has specially programed with specific programs such as Monopole, World of Flags, and Text Master that Jonathan uses to write his stories.

Our next meeting will be on April 11 at TCOM room 540. Hope to see everyone there.

## H.E.B. Robyn Wilson

At the March meeting there was a very informative discussion by Okley Moss, the sysop, on the usage of Bulletin Boards. The MCCC board was introduced by an on-line demonstration.

Come on out to the meeting and we will be glad to introduce S.A.M. to you!!! We will always have something interesting going on at all meetings, so come out and enjoy. will be worth your while!

At the April meeting we will be talking with S.A.M., the Software Automated Mouth. He will enable the computer to talk, read poems, and other neat features. The April meeting will be at Jesse Cardin's house again. Please note the address on the last page of this newsletter. If you need directions call me at 4285530. The May and June meetings will be at the Hurst Rec Center. There will be no meeting in July.
