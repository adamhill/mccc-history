## CanDo v1.60

## Harold Williams

W hen CanDo 1.5 released, INOVAtronics promised to follow it with a free upgrade that would include a tool to handle the joystick port. CanDo version 1.60 is now shipping. The GamePort Tool has been added along with another new tool called the Proportional Tool. There are several other new features and enhancements.

If you are pot familiar with CanDo, it is a remarkable programming tool that is designed to allow nonprogrammers to create real applications. CanDo uses the object oriented program approach. The simple, intuitive interface allows you to create applications ranging from simple utilities (like an on screen clock) to truly powerful applications (like custom data base managers). CanDo is also an outstanding multimedia tool because of its ability to handle pictures, sound and animation.

The new GamePort Tool allows you to detect events relating to either a mouse or joystick that is attached to the 2nd game port. GamePort events for a mouse are defined by movement of the mouse in the X or Y direction. If the event is related to a joystick, then several options are available. The joystick event can be detected for either all eight joystick positions or restricted to four positions. The joystick event can also be detected either repeatedly for as long as an event occurs or detected only when a joystick event changes. This sounds complicated, but it is actually quite simple to use. Basically, CanDo will tell you if the joystick is pressed up, up right, right, down right, down, down left, left, or up left. The mouse and joystick buttons are also supported in the GamePort Tool. Two and three button mice are supported, and one, two and three button joysticks are supported. The GamePort Tool has been added to CanDo through the XtraTools gadget.

The Proportional Tool adds the traditional Amiga slider objects. The Proportional Tool allows you to select either horizontal or vertical sliding gadgets or even a sliding gadget that works in both directions. The gadget can have the normal appearance of Amiga sliding gadgets or can be a custom brush. The sliding gadgets are simple to implement. The sliding gadgets cause events to occur when the knob (the part of the gadget that slides) moves to a new position and when the knob is released. There are several new commands and functions added to the CanDo scripting language that allow you to manipulate and read the new sliding gadgets.

The CanDo editor has always had several tools to simplify the writing of scripts. A new tool named CoordinateBox has been added. This tool is very similar to the old Coordinate Tool, but CoordinateBox returns both the coordinates of the upper left corner and the size of a dragged box.

There are also several new commands. ClosePendingWindow will force a subwindow to close. LoadPalette loads only the palette part of a picture or brush. SetSystemRequesterTo redirects DOS system requesters to either the current screen, Workbench, or nowhere. The ResizeWindow command will cause the current window to be resized. There are several new commands and functions relating to the use of hex strings, and functions for determining the current window and screen physical address.

Several new ToolTypes have been added to allow for customization of the CanDo environment. The two I like best are BigEd and MenuTool. BigEd adds 5 more lines of text to the script editor. MenuTool adds a new menu item named Tools. I've added all the tools found in XtraTools to this menu to make them more accessible. There are ToolTypes named ButtonBeep, DocumentBeep, FieldBeep, KeyBeep, and ObjectBeep that will cause a script with a PlaySound command to be automatically attached to the various object types.

This update also includes a large number of enhancements to the CanDo interface, along with a long list of bug fixes.

## Broadcast Titler 2

The best program I ever bought review by Bob Sackett, S.O.C.K.

N ot to leave you wondering long about how I feel, this is simply the best program I can remember buying! Broadcast Titler 2 tells you what it will do, shows you how, and then does it. Not 100% maybe, but in the high 90's anyhow. I have shelves of programs I bought, for all kinds of reasons, that don't generate the energy in me to wade through the Ph.D program required for getting them going. BT2 isn't so easy you can ignore the manual, but you can do enough right away to inspire you to press on. It's the first program I can remember where I read the whole manual, like a textbook, underlining and highlighting, because I was so excited to see what I could do next. Enough of the frosting; on to the

BT2 is one of two professional level titling programs available to Amiga owners, the other being Shereff's Pro Video Post. [Editor's Note: There is also NewTek's Video Toaster, of course.) These programs need to be of a highenough quality to use on the air. This requires good looking fonts, colors that translate will into NTSC (used by American television), and facility of use (so that functional screens can be generated now). When a face appears on TV, you don't have a half-hour to get it all together and turn out a screen sub-title telling the audience his name. You have to let your fingers do the flying and operate with the speed of a stand-up comedian. After a day with the program, I can do this. I think after a week or two with it, I could be of value to a small TV station that generates local programming. What you can do with it varies, but I assure you, your Christmas homevideo will stun them in Peoria this winter!

Speaking of colors, PV Post allowed 16 colors per page. BT2 allows 16 colors per line! With 20 lines on a page, that gives you a 320 color screen. The Hi-Res color barrier has been broken. Think of each line as a "color window" extending across your screen, as high as its tallest font. Each of these windows can contain 16 colors, independent of the 19 other possible windows. Colors are used up by the background, graphics loaded, and the font

BT2 comes with 16 fonts (4 styles in different sizes, ranging from 15 to 100 points). They are color fonts, and you have control over their colors. The fonts are antialiased and very sharp and precise; broadcast quality, you might say. Unlike PV Post, BT2 allows you to import other fonts of your choosing. They must be run through the included Font Conversion program, but it, like the rest of the package, is painless and user-friendly. I converted seven disks of Kara Fonts into BT2 format and they, being will anti-aliased in their own right, show beautifully in BT2. A new companion program, about to appear, will add anti-aliasing to converted fonts that are weak in this area. With this, your choices should be unlimited.

face, edge and shadow colors. Different positions on the 16-color palette line are reserved for different attributes. Color 0 is the genlock-transparent background color; Colors 4, 8, and 12 are reserved for the font face, shadow and outline, although colors 2, 6, and 10 may be substituted for the face color. What all this means is that each line must have the same background, shadow and outline color, but you have four choices for the face color. Any imported images utilize colors 0-7, with any unused

"Almost everything is mousecontrolled, with extensive, though not complete, keyboard backup."

upper range colors also available, so 16 color pictures must be converted to 13 colors, maximum, before loading, or your font colors are going to be messed up. For every benefit, there is a cost, right?

Almost everything is mouse-controlled, with extensive, though not complete, keyboard backup. The main menu is simple and gets you on to your desired tangent quickly. The font button lets you swiftly choose type, size, color, shadow and outline options. PV Post has a difficult-to-use color-shifting scheme for creating colorpatterned fonts. BT2 lets you do the same thing, but sends you off of the easier-to-use Deluxe Paint to do it. In DP, you create a brush of any pattern or color blend you want, make it bigger than your largest font, and import it into BT2, where all your letters may take on its hues or pattern. This brush can be saved for later use, encouraging you to build a library of your favorite font patterns.

The line menu is where your color palette awaits any changes. Each color in the palette can be any of the everfamous 4,096 Amiga tints. These colors can be further modified by a saturation slider, which adds or subtracts white from the color, and a value, or brightness slider, which adds or subtracts the color black. Colors made in one line can be easily transferred to another line, or even the whole page if your goal is something less garish than the 320-color possibility. The line menu allow you to bring in a graphic or pattern and, best of all, allows a choice of 16 effects that determine how this line will come onto the screen. Various directions of slides, wipes, fades, eases, stripes and spreads are available, as well as a nononsense cut or a letter-by-letter typing of the line.

The page menu contains the very same palette submenu, for speed of use, as well as tools for instantly

adding, deleting or inserting pages. Quick jumps to other pages can be done here. A layout menu is found which contains your basic formatting controls of margins, justification and tab stops. It also gives you control over where a crawl-message will run across your screen. A last, thoughtful option lets you set up temporary top and bottom margins in not-full pages that you would like to roll vertically on your screen. This eliminates gaps caused by empty lines between pages. Like everything else, it is easy to use and works as advertised.

Finally, there is the play menu where you get to see what you have done. Using the F-Keys, you can play from the current position, from the top, or randomly. Looping is implemented. For those of you without large globs of memory, a Presto feature is included that pre-renders a series of complete pages to speed up their viewing. BT2 is even genlock-friendly. Sometimes you might find your NTSC monitor picture isn't evenly centered, although your computer screen looks swell. You can shift the NTSC display to perfection. Nice touch!

The most dazzling part of the page menu is the Effect button. Pushing it gives you a full screen of special effect choices for each page. As an example, let's start page 2 off on a blank screen which fades to black. Page 2 appears out of this black and, after a time which you decide, flips inverted, and on the rebound, shows page 3! And remember, each line on the page can have its own special effect. Naturally, not all effects are compatible, the laws of physics being what they are, but with a little use, you can dream up some pretty impressive combinations. I forgot to mention that color-cycling is also implemented as well as letter-flashing. There is even a digital clock available for inclusion in your sequence.

The file menu lets you load a previous masterpiece, save your present one or clear it out to start again. It is also where you load external graphics and fonts that you have pre-converted and saved on your special BT2 Font disk. You can also import ASCII text files here, which will take on the attributes of the page into which they will appear. With this feature you can type up a column of names in ED, the Amiga text-editor, let BT2 take them in and, for example, roll them as screen credits. This is a lot easier than entering each name on a line in BT2.

To run BT2, you need an Amiga of any sort, with 1.5 megs of RAM. 2 megs are recommended if you a re going to import additional fonts or graphics. A "Super-Hi Resolution" upgrade is available for A3000 owners that will take advantage of the 3000's higher resolution. Fatter Agnus is not required, unlike PV Post. Wouldn't hurt, though! BT2 is not copy protected and comes with a demo disk that, after it knocks your socks off, is the basis for a 24 hour information display that will self-load and re-start in case of a power failure. These folks have thought of everything! Two of the fonts also include complete international accent characters, an addition generated by popular demand. Pages may be saved as IFF pictures to be shown with your favorite viewer program.

Included in the manual are a number of tutorials that lead you by the hand through the main features of the program. Take the time to do them and you'll have all you need to wander further into the main garden of BT2 by yourself. They even have a tutorial which steps you through the Deluxe Paint operation I mentioned above. And additional help is available for ED, in case you never used it. What kind of program shows you how to operate other guy's software? This could start a trend! I called Innovision to see how their support was and was put in touch with a person who was both helpful and knowledgeable.

In looking this article over, I notice you can write a much more thorough review when you know what you are talking about. This is no credit to me, but rather to the quality of programs like Broadcast Titler, that are just a lot of fun to use. Enjoy!

Any problems with it? Just a couple. First, if you have a background program going, kill it before you enter BT2. It is non-multitasking. With its demands on chip RAM, it couldn't be. I left MachIll running and lost control of my keyboard in BT2! I had some strange color flashing when I tried to use the crawl placement button. It worked; just gave me some weird flashing while I was selecting a new value. By the way, the red power light turns off on an Amiga 500 after Broadcast Titler is loaded. Innovision tells me this is normal. Finally, once in a while, when I type in a letter on a line, I don't get the letter, but rather a rectangle full of junk. The couple of times this has happened, it was while using a large font with a capital letter. The time I remember was with font Swiss\_100 and the letter was "M". All the other letters worked fine. Changing the font made everything better. Maybe a bug, maybe my machine. (I'm using a 500 with 68030 and I've seen some strange things lately!)

## CanDo v1.60 Continued from page 1

CanDo 1.60 is a free update to registered owners of CanDo 1.5. Registered owners should be receiving a disk in the mail sometime in the next few weeks. The update procedure requires you to make a copy of the original 1.5 disks, then the install-update program will convert the disks to version 1.60. After the 1.60 disks are created, the new version of CanDo can be installed on your hard drive or floppies. If you do not own CanDo, you should find version 1.60 is already in the stores.

INOVAtronics created a revolutionary product when they released CanDo about two years ago. They have continued to improve CanDo without asking for outrageous upgrade prices. Now, they are offering another significant upgrade for free. You just can't get it any better than this!

## TCP/IP on the Amiga

from the newsletter of the Pittsburgh Commodore Group by Ed Berger

uring the 1970s, as computers became more wide spread across the country, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded research into creating a national network for researchers that would allow the exchange of electronic mail, file transfer, and remote login to various computers around the country. This led to the development of a non-vendor specific group of communications standards called TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol, Internet Protocol). These standards allow many machines with very different operating systems, and network hardware to integrate together into a single large network, known as the Internet. TCP/I works by setting a standard for network data (IP and UDP packets), host and network addressing (IP numbers), and network services (TCP ports). The original Internet, known as the ARPANET consisted mainly of large research laboratories, and universities, communicating to each other via leased 56Kbps phone lines. Around 1985, the National Science Foundation decided to create a new, faster Internet for connecting its Supercomputer centers, so that researchers nationwide could have access to the available computing tools. This developed the NSFnet, which connected the major centers with leased T1 (1.54Mbps phone lines), and promoted the development of "mid-level" networks such as PREPnet. (Pennsylvania Research Educational Partners, a statewide network connecting schools like Duquesne University, Pitt, Carnegie Mellon, Penn State, UPenn, Drexel, and some commercial companies, like USX, Carnegie Group, etc.) Currently the NSFnet is developing into a T3 (45Mbps) network. The Internet has developed into an international network that spans Europe, Australia, and Japan as well as the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Without development of standards such as TCP/IP, this would not be possible.

For the Amiga, running AmigaOS there are two ways currently available to connect to the Internet. Commodore's AS225 software with the A2065 Ethernet card, allows me to connect to the Internet via the Ethernet network already available at work. The other way is via some freely distributable software called KA9q via SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol), which allows low cost dynamic connectivity to the Internet via dialup phone lines, similar to a BBS. Unlike a BBS, where you have to call different phone numbers to talk to different systems, once you are part of the Internet, you may send and receive data from any other system that you have authorization to. You can have multiple "sessions" as in terminal windows to several different machines. You can be receiving a file from one machine, sending to another, and reading mail on a third, all by one modem connection, or other network connection like Ethernet. There is, however, a price to be paid for this power, and that is slower performance. FTP (file transfer protocol) across the network is slower than Zmodem on a BBS connected at the same speed. With faster modems becoming available, or faster network connections like Ethernet the speed penalty is not severe, and made up for by increased productivity. The Amiga with its multitasking operating system makes a good match for the multitasking inherent in TCP/IP.

company!) YO u can usually spot Ken either in his little cubbyhole working on someone's machine, or at the DTP station.

Ken has owned

Amiga since 1985, when he bought a 1000 at the Navy Exchange in Charleston, SC. He was stationed there onboard the USS Casimir Pulaski, a nuclear missile carrying submarine. Sez Ken, "On patrol, I had a lot of time to study everything I could get my little hands on about the Amiga. That provided a pretty good base to build upon."

When Ken got out of the Navy, he got a job at Southern Technologies, Inc. which was located here in Dallas. STI was an exclusively Amiga distributor. That was where he learned Desktop Publishing. "! was in charge of creating the catalogs we sent to our dealers. We were the first distributor to do everything in house on an Amiga."

Later, Ken attended the CBM sponsorea Repair school ("they actually taught me more than I expected!"), and has been fixing broken machines ever since. "It's actually trickier than you might think, as the same symptom can be caused by several different things. It's always challenging, and I guess that's why I enjoy it so much."

(continued from previous column)

Ken's hobbies include Amiga RPG games ("but | love Moria the best!"), GURPS roleplaying, reading Science Fiction, and spending quality time with this wite Laurel and daughter Cara. (They've really changed my life, and for the better!")

The Edge Computer &amp; Video announces new low, low pricing on the Great Valley Products line for the Amiga. One simple restriction applies, but these are our everyday prices; not specials or old discontinued merchandise. Ihe restriction is simple; you come in put down a 25% deposit, and we order the item blue label. You have it in two days, at the lowest possible price. And after all, what's more important, having it right this second, or saving money?

## The EDGE Announces The Advant-EDGE Card!

Effective immediately, both EDGE Computer &amp; Video locations are offering the Advant-EDGE card. This card increases your ability to save when you purchase products. Costing only $7.95, it will allow you to save over 180% during the course of a year. The way it works is simple; the first time each month you purchase most anything (Amigas, Toasters, and a very few others excluded, ask store personnel for details), you get 5% off the top. The next time that month you get 10%! Each card is good for a year. Come in and ask for all the details!

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

A RQ by Martin Laubach and Peter Wicek No, I don't know what ARQ stands for. What · I DO know is that ARQ is a really nice system enhancement. What is does is replace the standard system requesters with really nice-looking ones. Specifically, here are the requesters that are replaced.

After running ARQ, when the system pops up any of the above requesters, in place of the standard (boring)

system requesters you will see beautiful, animated requesters (with optional sound) that just make the Amiga much more professional. ARQ works with version 1.3 and 2.0 of the operating system but looks much better when run in interlace mode. Check it out. It's on MCCCА 375.

## Icons by Michael Heinz, Matt Marulla &amp; Nick Dragovich

If you're new to the 2.0 operating system, you've probably wanted some new icons to replace some of your older ones. Icons that perhaps would take advantage of the new embossed look — or that would have eight or even sixteen colors to take advantage of the new Workbench resolutions - or that would look good when run in interlace. Well, look no further... this is your month. MCCC-A 375 contains three sets of icons from three different artists. Michael Heinz has put together a set of icons designed primarily to use on an interlaced Workbench. Matt Marulla has put together a set of icons to replace the standard Prefs icons supplied with 2.0. His set looks the same but is remapped to a 16 color palette. It comes with a set of palette colors that can simply be clicked on to activate. They look really good. Finally, Nick Dragovich has put together a set of icons to use for PageStream 2.2. All of them are really nice.

## MouseBlanker by Stefan Sticth

MouseBlanker is a AmigaOS 2.0 commodity that blanks the pointer. Have you gotten tired of trying to peek behind a pointer that never seems to be out of the way? Have you missed QMouse since upgrading to 2.0? Well, MouseBlanker to the rescue. It blanks the pointer after a specified time in which the pointer has not been moved AND it blanks the pointer immediately if a key is pressed. The pointer re-appears as soon as you move the mouse again. To install, simply drop it in the WBStartup drawer. Nothing could be easier. It's on MCCC-A. -376.

## Pointer by Steve Tibbett

PointerX is another 2.0 commodity. This one replaces

the standard wait pointer with an animated one. Now when you're waiting for something to happen, the hands on the little watch spin around. Nothing important here. Just some more window-dressing. But since it's only 1468 bytes — why not? It's on MCCC-A\_376 too.

## Spliner by Tom Rokicki and Sebastiano Vigna

Spliner is a screen-blanker for AmigaOS 2.0. If you used Mackie under 1.3 then you already know what this is. Spliner is a stripped-down Mackie that contains only the screen blank part of the program. It is designed to work as a commodity under 2.0. If you DON'T know what Mackie is... time for a brief explanation. Spliner blanks the screen after a specified time period. But instead of merely putting up a black, boring screen, Spliner gives you an entertaining series of patterns to watch. It's relatively small (just 10K), it serves a useful function, and it's entertaining. What more could you want? Look for it on MCCC-A\_376.

## HP-500C Print Driver

Have you bought a Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500C only to discover that there is no print driver available to let you print in color. The wait is over (and it really wasn't that long a wait). Here is a driver that lets you print in color or in black and white. It's on MCCC-A\_377.

If you are a fan of tracker or module music, you have probably continued to search for that just-right mod player. Some have serious problems, some use up almost all your system resources, some have a less than adequate file requester, some play the music at the wrong speed — the list goes on and on. ModuleMaster is the best player I have found so far. It sounds good, it uses very little of your system's resources in its normal mode, it will play scripts (a series of musical pieces), and it has a bunch of optional features. Among them are the SCOPES and SPECTRUM options that visually show the music being played — similar to that found on some stereo equipment. However, turning these options on causes system utilization to skyrocket. There is one other, very unusual option — a Kaleidoscope. This option brings up a full screen and fills it with colorful patterns. And this option uses very little of your system's resources. Gives you something to watch if you are doing nothing but playing music. Look for ModuleMaster on MCCC-A\_377. By the way, MCCC-A\_377 also offers a prime example of how good tracker music can be with Toccata. Be sure to check it out.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-loop Pete Goad

The February Amiga By-TheLoop assembly, at the North Richland Hills Community Center, was attended by more than 40 people. Although the parking lot is still undergoing construction, it was much easier to get to this meeting than our last one.

A lively question and answer session then followed with David trying to answer questions, or at least pointing people in the direction of answers and fending off the latest rumors. (What does this new Agnus chip do that the fatter, obese and fattest don't?).

opportunity to generate standard Amiga programs fast and efficiently, without knowing the ins and outs of a "standard" computer language or even the operating system. For the more advanced user who wants to put together a program that keeps tabs on the task load, memory usage and hard disk capacity in its own window, CanDo offers full capabilities to do all of this and more as Harold expertly showed us.

We started off with David Owens (Loop President) bringing member's attention to the new Beginner's SIG. An Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Amiga, but were afraid to ask Special Interest Group aimed at those new to Commodore's multi-tasking machines.

The presentation this month was to have been given by Scott Lamb. Unfortunately he was unable to make it, so Harold Williams, armed with a recently upgraded V2.0 A2000, (See last month's newsletter) stepped bravely into the breach to demonstrate the new features of CanDo V1.6. This is the current upgrade apparently and should be mailed to registered users by the time you read this.

Harold started out by explaining that CanDo is not really a computer language nor is it AmigaVision, although it can be manipulated to perform the same functions. Harold then proceeded to show a Deck (CanDo's sequence of instructions) that he had built to provide system information in a standard Amiga window. He then demonstrated some of the many features that CanDo is capable of, the majority of them just a mouse click away. CanDo offers even the novice Amiga user the

The Loop Chapter hopes to see you at our next meeting in March.

For the curious, the enhancements added to CanDo V1.6 include proportional gadgets, Right Mouse button and full Joystick support. Thank you Harold for an excellent presentation.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Whooee, you're gonna wish you hadn't missed this one, if you weren't at our February meeting! We went through the usual news and rumors (more later) and were eagerly awaiting Mark Henry's Audio Digitizing demo, when two Special Guests arrived. Our pres, Henry Ribron, had invited them to drop by as a surprise, but didn't expect them to come Bearing Gifts and loaded with hardware and software for a super demo. Gracefully, Mark relinquished his spotlight to the team from Newtek: Kiki Stockhammer and Lee Stranahan! Kiki is the one seen in the spectacular "Kiki effects" (fancy Toaster transitions), and is hailed as the Demo Queen of NewTek. She and Lee set up their system and proceeded to flood us with new 2.0 features and highlights, which were being shown at the Image World exposition. Toaster System 2.0 adds lots of capabilities you would expect to require hardware changes, but they are all implemented in spectacular software upgrades. The "Ooooh"s and "Ahhh"s echoed as we saw new transitions like smoke, fire, clouds, and pouring liquid (instead of "fade to black" ', how bout "pour to black"?). Kiki's image danced, did cartwheels, and passed shapely legs between video images, and my favorite of all was the peekaboo transition, where her silhouette discovers us watching her cavorting and yanks down the window shade! Interested in sports? Lots of new transitions there, from golf swings to baseball pitches to footballs passed directly at the viewer. Some of these have already been seen at places like Reunion Arena (yes, they have a toaster!). The simple page turn now has rips, peels, flips... there are windshield wipers and jigsaw puzzles, shutters and the snazzy color-bending ChromaF/X. Combine sepia-tones with a scratched-film simulation and you have an old-timey movie image! All these miracles were explained simply by Kiki... New Tek is actually staffed by aliens. (You read it here first!).

Along with the many new transitions come 150 changes in the Lightwave program package, including raytracing, and features like ASCII-file input to the character generator (wanna see the Declaration of Independence scroll by?) so your text can be edited and imported from elsewhere. New tutorials and manuals are much improved, and even include a Computer 101 For The Complete Idiot, so folks like me can get started. Hardware news: Lee said work on a 3000-fitting board has taken a back seat to important Other Stuff they're developing, as they do want to Do It Right and not just kludge together a quick fix that'll fit. You CAN, however, now have your 3000 case notched BY YOUR DEALER without voiding your warranty, so grab your tin snips and head to your friendly local dealer. (Call first.) Kiki and Lee brought a plethora of goodies... demo tapes, buttons, brochures, T-shirts,

## CHAPTER NEWS

and free passes to the last day of ImageWorld. My husband got lucky and grabbed a tape, and we shared it with an envious non-Amiga-owning friend. "Ooooh, Ahhhh", he said. Sound familiar? See this yourself, if you can find one. Awesome. Thanks to our very special VIPs for an outstanding demo and a lot of fun. Hope we see you again!

Somehow, in the afterglow, my TidBytes section seems more trivial, but it was interesting as ever. Seems McDuffs is dropping the Amiga, but is still trying to sell dusty floor models at full price. Hmmm. Montgomery Wards, on the other hand, was seen showing off an Amiga with a pretty demo display. One member found a bug in Broadcast Titler II, and got a rapid fix in the mail... always good news to be well supported. We have a new SIG starting up, to be called the Beginners SIG or some such. Look elsewhere in the newsletter for more info. On the other end of the scale, Karl Zettl ((214) 399-0474) is interested in forming an ADVANCED Users Group. Call him if you're interested, too. Do you use the Fast ROM option on your A3000, and have odd crashes and wierd problems with some major programs? Try turning it off, and see if things improve. Let us know what happens! Mark Henry introduced us to John Chang, new manager of the Irving Edge location, who has much Amiga experience and confesses to membership in Amiganoids Anonymous. (We seem to have several members in common.) Welcome, John! We also had a special visitor from Floppy Joe's in Plano — Tom Lima. Tom explained that they still rent some Amiga software (bought prior to December 1990), but all their newer stuff is for sale at a sizeable discount off retail. Here's the neat trick: they have a special "restocking program" which allows buyers to return software after a 3-day trial period, getting all of their money back except for a $5 or 10% restocking fee. They have a lot of IBM shareware, and may expand to Miac and Amiga libraries, and they rent games for Nintendo and other systems. They are looking forward to expanding their non game lineup, and proceeds from memberships, sales, etc. for the next couple of months will be directed towards Amiga products. Call them at 9858066 or drop by Parker &amp; Independence, near Blockbuster Video. More TidBytes: Amiga UNIX 2.1 is now purchasable, $995 for a 2-user system, $1195 for unlimited users. A "UFO sighting": a non-spray-painted gen-u-ine CDTV keyboard, and a mysterious internal 40-meg drive (not available for sale yet) at ImageWorld. Note from abroad: a computer art and animation contest in ITALY was soliciting entries from Amiga users and others, but the deadline will pass before this gets to you. Perhaps Mary Johnson will hear about the winning entries and share the news with us. Have you heard about all the latest Commodore promotions, like $500 off a 25mhz A3000, or free monitor with your A2000 (with 2.0!)? Check with your dealers! Pro Write has a neat contest... go in for a demo and get signed up for a drawing for a CDTV Odyssey package! By the way, did you know that you can trade in an old SuperDisk for an updated version at no additional cost? (SuperDisks are collections of related utilities, etc. deemed to be especially useful, maintained and occasionally updated with newer and better stuff, found in the Club Library.) Brett Hester's Self-Serve Fish Market was again operating in the back, a user-friendly Fish Disk Copier on his CDTV. Check it out!

We had over 50 members and guests present and participating, and we are happy to see you all! Next month we will probably see a ParNet presentation (a package that elegantly links multiple Amigas), and other interesting stuff still pending. With all the new hardware, software, upgrades, etc. coming at us, it can be difficult to pin down a demo. (Perhaps Mark Henry will try the audio digitizing demo again soon.) Seems you never know what, or who, will happen next at the Amiga North Dallas gathering! One certainty: great door prizes! The Edge brought us Vista, ROTOX, Amiga Power Magazine (with disk), and a special Amiga World issue. Metropolitan offered Championship Run, Purple Saturn Day, and Space Cutter. Floppy Joe's contributed a lifetime membership to their store. Then there were all the goodies from NewTek... a night to remember! See you next time.

## Amiga West Ben Clingerman

Our feature speaker for January was Kerry Batts. Kerry and Doug Gaudin demonstrated Kerry's soonto-be-released game from Merit Software Tom Landry's Legendary NFL Football. Kerry states that the title may change a little before its release. This fantastic new game will allow all of us armchair quarterbacks to realistically control a Pro Football Team. Kerry and Tom Landry have set up all the offensive and defensive formations for you to control - and these are all the plays used in the NFL. Tom Landry's NFL Football is a TELEGAME which means you may call up a friend to play against via modem. Or you can play against the computer. The game will come with Tom Landry's team line-up including Tony Dorsett, Roger Staubach, Robert Newhouse and others. The game has many windows that control the various aspects of the game such as a player's vital stats which include such things as injures, yards gained per carry, yards lost per carry, average tackles, assists, etc. You

could match up the Cowboys against Texas A&amp;M if for some reason you wanted to - or you could load stats of a player who hasn't played for your team to see how he does. Kerry, Tom Landry and Merit Software have a winner of game here. Thank you Kerry for sharing it with us — now how about that game with the Packers? If I just changed quarterbacks and added Tony Dorsett... Hummm.

At the February Amiga West Meeting we had to have our meeting out in the lobby at Texas Osteopathic College Of Medicine due to a new procedure on reserving the auditorium that no one had told any of us about. Ansoft sent door prizes for this month's meeting. Thank you, Jerry and Dave. John Belyeu won a Amiga coffeę mug and Nick Phiripes won a copy of 3-D Text Animator.

Jack Smith was to demonstrate CDTV but he was taken ill so our Vice President, Robert Carroll stepped right in and went over the system. The demonstration was mainly to familiarize everyone with the copying of information from CD to diskette. Robert had on hand the Fred Fish collection and let whoever wanted to, copy a program to diskette. 650 megs is sure a lot of information to have on one CD.

of diminishing support for our 8-bit machines. The latest Harv Harris Tax Survival program was briefly explained and demonstrated by yours truly. And there was a bit of discussion and demonstration of some GEOS fundamentals for those who are just getting into that realm of computing. Some of the members reported on their journey to Infomart for a Super Saturday visit with the members of SCOPE. This outing was in lieu of our chapter's normal Saturday workshop. There may be opportunities to take in this event again another time, so stay tuned to our chapter news and announcements. Speaking of the Saturday workshop, there will be a change in locations for the workshop for the months of March and April. Blake and Dorothy Brown will host the workshop at their home, 2009 Cypress Ct., Grand Prairie. Call them at 214-641-0424 if you need directions or further information. These workshops take place on the second Saturday of the month. At the March chapter meeting, we will see and discuss some of the features unique to the C128 system, and see some of the "must-have" applications if you are using the C128. Hope to see you there.

Even with a major problem we all pulled together to have a great meeting and learn new ways of using our computers. That's what we all joined the club for anyway, wasn't it? To meet people with the same conviction to the Commodore line of computers. See you next month!

## Arl/Grand Prairie Brad Dumler

Another interesting meeting was held at the Grand Prairie Public library in February. We gained another new member and learned that our chapter membership is holding up rather well in these times

## Fort Worth Mary Louise Hagemeyer

The Fort Worth Chapter had a moving meeting in February. We convened in the parking lot of the church on West Berry, found no one with a key to let us in, then drove many miles in a convoy to the Englewood United Methodist Church, which graciously provided a meeting room. We hope the firsttime visitors and prospective members will join us next month in our New Meeting Place at TCOM.

Joe Ostrokol discussed the new tax program, Bob Hoskins played some new songs on Stereo SID

Player, and Brenda Sessums demonstrated some of the good programs available on Loadstar disks. James Dunnam demonstrated BB Talker 64, the word processor that can read text aloud.

Now hear this: We will meet March 14, 1:30 p.m., at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Camp Bowie at Montgomery. Call John Sookma, 293-8891 for more details.

## H.E.B. Robun Wilson

At the February meeting, there was an online demonstration of BASIC programming. Three computers, two of which were C128's, were all used by members for an online lesson. JiffyDos was discussed also.

Many people have shown an interest in S.A.M, which is short way of saying "The Software Automated Mouth". We will be discussing the many uses of S.A.M. Your computer will talk to you with this program!!

The March meeting will be all about Bulletin Boards. We will be discussing the new MCCC Bulletin Board, Startext, and any other boards of interest (providing there is a password).

The March and April meetings will be at Jesse Carden's house which is located at 5309 Jerri Lane in Haltom City. The May and June meetings will be back at the Hurst Recreation Center. We can only reserve two months ahead for the center and sometimes they are really booked up for a long time. Please look at the back of your newsletter to make sure of the location. We look forward to seeing you at our meetings!!

Note: The July 4th meeting may be held on the 11th (the second Saturday in July). Watch for more info.
