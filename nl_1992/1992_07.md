## AmTRAC Trackball

The mouse of choice when there's no room for a mouse by John Malmstrom

Y ou say that you bought that tiny little computer desk 8 years ago to go with that spanking new C-64? And now you've got an Amiga 500 complete with expansion box, hard drive, and an external floppy, but it takes up most of the desk space so there's hardly any room for the mouse? Do you get the mouse tangled in its own tail every time you use it? Well, my friend, the AmTRAC trackball from MicroSpeed might just be the answer.

Thanks to the folks at MicroSpeed, an AmTRAC was made available to us for demonstration. In the last two months it finally made its way to all the Amiga chapter meetings where you may have had a chance to see how it worked and to try it out for yourself. If not, let me briefly tell you my impressions.

The AmTRAC is an opto-electronic trackball pointing device designed to be a direct replacement for the Amiga mouse. It has a 2.25" ball and is housed in an injection molded plastic case the same color as your keyboard. The case measures 3.75" by 6.75" and is 2.4" high at the center of the ball, sloping to the tabletop in front of the ball. The usual right and left buttons are provided along with a third button called the drag lock button. Installation is incredibly simple — unplug the mouse cable, plug in the AmTrac cable.

How did it work? Well, learning to use a trackball is just like learning to use a mouse. It's a matter of training your muscles to do what your brain wants. I've used a mouse for several hours a day for several years, so pointing, selecting, double-clicking, and dragging are so ingrained into my actions that I never think about them anymore. I thought that learning to use the AmTRAC would be a bit difficult. I had tried out trackballs before and found them to be awkward for me. Not so with the AmTRAC. This is probably due to what they call their "ergonomic design." For one thing, the case slopes from a height of 2.4" at the center of the ball to tabletop level at the front. This provides a comfortable wrist rest. Secondly, the right and left buttons surround the ball so that it is easy to move the ball (thus the pointer) with either the palm of your hand or the fingertips and click on the buttons at the same time. Being able to maintain contact with the ball and the buttons simultaneously makes it easier to position the pointer accurately to make a selection. With most trackballs the dragging operation is especially awkward. The AmTRAC drag lock button solves this. It performs the same function as clicking and holding a button down while moving the cursor. Simply click and release the drag lock button, perform the dragging operation, and click on any button to release the drag lock. It worked slick for me. After a few hours use I felt (almost) as comfortable with the AmTRAC as with the mouse. MicroSpeed suggests setting the mouse acceleration to its maximum, and I agree. At that setting, I was able to zip the pointer around the screen with ease, yet accurately position the pointer for delicate work. I mostly use my Amiga for desktop publishing, word processing, databases, telecommunications and, of course, games. AmTrac seemed to work equally well with all of them.

Will I change from mouse to AmTRAC? Probably not - at least not until the mouse dies - I'm just too comfortable with the trusty rodent. But, if you're cramped for desk space or are uncomfortable using a mouse, I can heartily recommend the AmTRAC. It's available at our local dealers, or is available directly from MicroSpeed at a substantial user group discount off the suggested retail price of $99. If you're interested, let me know, and I'll get an order blank to you. Or you might be lucky at this year's METCOM. We'll be giving away the demonstration AmTRAC as a door prize.

Commodore's new multiscan color monitor

## by Harold Williams

have been wanting to change to a monitor that I 1950 monitor bas Bees aralit ano the 300 walt 1950 monitor has been available since the 3000 was introduced, and of course there are several good monitors made by other companies. Now Commodore has released a new multiscan monitor, the 1960. I happened on a special deal at Ansoft that was too good to pass up. So, now I am the proud owner of a 1960. I also purchased Commodore's 2320 Display Enhancer card to eliminate interlace flicker. Now I am running virtually everything in interlaced mode and loving it!

The specs on the 1960 include 0.28 mm dot pitch, with 1024 X 768 image resolution. The screen measures 14 inches diagonally. The 1960 comes with a cable designed to connect to a 15-pin D-connector (like the connector on the 2320 display enhancer) and an adapter to connect to a 23-pin video port (the standard Amiga video port). There is also a nice tilt/swivel base that makes it very easy to adjust the viewing perspective. Fortunately, the tilt/swivel base can be removed. It adds about two inches of height to the monitor and that's about an inch and a half that won't fit into my computer desk.

All the controls are at the front of the monitor. The brightness and contrast controls are located at the right along with the on/off switch. There are five controls hidden under a panel on the left. These controls include vertical center, vertical size, horizontal phase (center), a manual/auto vertical size switch, and width add/normal switch. These last two switches greatly enhance the 1960's display. Most multisync monitors do not use all of the monitor's display area, but leave a black border around the display. The manual/auto vertical size switch along with the vertical size control allows the vertical display to use the full height of the monitor screen. The width add/normal switch adds a colored border (like an Amiga ought to have) on the left and right or leaves the normal black border (like lesser computers are accustomed to). When properly adjusted, the display uses the full screen and there are no strange wiggly lines at the top or zippered edges. Some monitors display a variety of such strange effects depending partly on the display enhancer used. The 1960 display is perfectly stable when used with the 2320 Display Enhancer, and I suspect it would be the same when used with other products.

## Postscript fonts

How PageStream owners can save space by Bill Raecke

n last month's MCCC News, 1 wrote an article about disadvantages they provide, and how Pagestream owners can save space by eliminating duplicates. This month I have similar news. It turns out there is a simple way to save space by eliminating unnecessary files from your Postscript Type 1 fonts.

There is one other file type to keep. It is optional, so it may not be there... or there may be many, each with a different number. Look for files ending in "abf". The "abf" used for screen displays. These files will make the display work much more quickly. The different sizes (indicated by

Some Postscript Type 1 fonts are distributed on our BBS and in our library with a lot of files that PageStream doesn't use. Since PageStream is the only DTP package on the Amiga currently supporting Postscript fonts, there isn't any reason to keep them around. They are files used for one purpose or another on other computers. All you have to do to save space is to locate those unnecessary files and delete them. But rather than tell you what to delete, Ill tell you what to keep. PageStream needs two files to be present for any Postscript Type 1 font: a file ending in ".afm" and a file ending in "pfb". The " afm" file (Adobe Font Metric) contains the character width and spacing information. The "pfb" file (Printer Font Binary) contains the actual font outlines. You need to be careful here. I have seen some fonts distributed without a suffix at the end of one of the file names. If one of the files doesn't have a suffix and you can't find both the "afm" and the "pfb" files, keep the one without the suffix. By default, it must be one of these two.

files (Adobe Binary Font) contain bitmapped information the different numbers in the file names) will be used at different magnification settings in PageStream.

To summarize, you must have a file ending in "pfb" and a file ending in "afm" — and you may also have one or more files ending in "abf". Anything other than those may be discarded. Usually they will be files ending in "pfm" or ".bma". The bad news is that". pfm" files are normally rather small... but remember, on the Amiga each file occupies a minimum of 1k no matter how small it is. By eliminating all the unnecessary files from my Postscript fonts I was able to reclaim 301,568 bytes of space on my hard drive.

## Spring Thing The Report

Lots of fun — if you like rain

## by Vice President, David Owens

he Spring event was a whopping success. I hav 1st 00 shal severe one a it sen and I hope I shall never see one like it again. When I showed up at the pavilion at around 11:15am, Ned Kelly was standing alone under the pavilion. Why was he alone you may ask? Just because it was cloudy, cool, windy, and lest I forget, rainy. But that didn't spoil our party spirit in the least. Ned and my family braved the elements to make this the best spring event ever. Ned had brought his party supplies and I had too. Only one thing was missing. The guy that was supposed to bring the brickettes and the matches. Well, we waited and waited and waited.

Genny White and family showed up but decided not to brave the elements and spent another 45 minutes driving back to north Dallas where they cooked their yummys over an open oven. Meanwhile, Ned &amp; I were about ready to pack things in, when Robyn Wilson and John Malmstrom drove up. Well, they were ready to party down, too. Ned &amp; I decided to give Harold Williams just a few more minutes before we left and low and behold, who should drive up right at the last minute, but Harold and Judy with all the cooking stuff (and 2 hamburgers from Whataburger). Well, Ned and John got the fire going, and Judy, Robyn, myself (David Owens), Ned and John stood around the fire with umbrellas and

cooked our burgers and hot- dogs. Well... except for Ned. He brought a Tbone steak. Boy did that look good grilled.

After we finished eating we took part in the planned activities. Megan won the baby duck counting contest and pointing out the most flying birds. She won a copy of Barney Bear Goes to School. Other door prizes included an Amiga Genlock won by Ned Kelly, a 105 meg Quantum hard drive won by John Malmstrom, an Amiga 500p with monitor won by Robyn Wilson, a Video Toaster won by Harold Williams and the grand prize of a $10,000 dollar (choose what you want) computer system won by Joanna Owens (my wife). NOT!!! Well, anyway, we had an interesting time freezing our hineys off and then we all split. Hope to see you there next year.

## Pinball Dreams

Just like I remember it by David Owens

of these electro-magnetic marvels. The flashing lights, the ringing bells and the ka-chunk of the score increasing at a incredibly slow rate. Well, it was incredibly slow for me. I'm talking about the first time I came in contact with a Pinball machine. I used to pump quarters into them by the truckloads before computers and video games were invented. Ah, the memories.

There are 4 different pinball simulations that you can play: Ignition, Steel Wheel, Beat-Box and Nightmare. Steel Wheel is more like the really old pinball machines and has nothing more than bumpers and targets. The others are more like the more recent machines I've seen with ramps and ball traps. Really nice to play. The only downside to this package is that it isn't hard drive installable, therefore it is very slow loading and you have to keep the disks fairly handy. The disks are also copy protected so you can't make backups. Other than that, I recommend that you run right out and get this game. It's Great!!!

If you long to re-live those past experiences or if you are interested in seeing what you missed out on, have I got a deal for you. 21st Century Entertainment has released a new pinball simulation. Why, you may ask, is this not a game? This goes beyond any pinball game I have ever played (and I have played them all). This game is so close to standing in front of a pinball machine that it is uncanny. Granted, when I first heard about the game, I was skeptical that it would much better than any other pinball game I have played on a computer. First off, the play area scrolls. You have three screen lengths of the pinball play area to navigate. At first I thought this would prove to be very difficult but the scrolling screens work so well, that after the first time or two you hardly notice. There are plenty of bumpers, targets, ramps and traps to add to your score and if you play with two or more people, you can win jackpot bonus points. Up to eight people can play any game and you control the pinball machine with the keyboard and/or the mouse. One of the really nice features is you can tilt the machine. You use the space bar to do this. But watch out because you can tilt the machine and lose your turn. The music can also be turned on and off, but I enjoyed having it on.

## Astrology for the Amiga

by Tim Gore he topic of astrology is a controversial one to be think of it as the stuff of witch doctors, air-heads and former First Ladies. These people often wish it would go the way of the dinosaurs. Their nasty insinuations imply that persons who claim adherence to astrology are either terminally gullible or they are Charlatans. The argument is a very old and passionate one which I must note but it is not the focus of this article so I will devote little space to it. Suffice it to say that there are indeed intelligent, credible people who adhere to the proposition that astrology is a legitimate study. These people deserve quality software for their study.

Mystic Software has a $25 offering which provides "birth charts" and interpretations but doesn't include other features an advanced astrologer looks for. For example it only offers one house system while Astrolabe's NOVA for the IBM and Mac offers 39. Most astrologers want either Placidus, Koch or Equal houses available. I

![Image](1992_07_artifacts/image_000004_c02f2afadc2384225036a9dc3866c379256dc14531d8d257d8c1e7c225f82da2.png)

have not seen the output quality of Mystic's offering so I cannot rate it for you.

The best I've found is a British firm named Astrocalc which does offer several Amiga astrology programs for the advanced astrologer. Astrocalo's approach is modular. This means that you may start with their basic "A1" program and for a small upgrade fee improve it until you have a program customized to your needs. The printouts need work before they equal Astrolabe's NOVA or Matrix's Blue Star (both for IBM and Mac), however they are very good quality and are certainly worth the price. 'Therein lies the rub." Since Astrocale is from England you have to pay in Pounds Sterling or Eurocheque.

For those interested, you may write Mystic Software 706 Richards Drive, Mountain Grove, MO 65711. You may write Astrocalc 67 Peascroft Road, Hemel Hempsted, Herts HP3 8ER. England. Astrolabe's address is Astrolabe, Box 28, Orleans, MA 02653.

Regrettably, professional quality astrological software is reserved for lesser computer systems than the Amiga. Astrolabe and Matrix Software are the two primary manufacturers of astrological software in the United States and both devote their development to the IBM and MacIntosh. Astrolabe does offer a "research" program which sells for $225 titled CCRS. CCRS is a port of an IBM program and the graphic output is technical but good if you are studying astrology scientifically as opposed to practicing it as a business or hobbyist. Matrix Software offers nothing for the Amiga.

## Amiga Library News

Public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke uarterback 5.01 patch In last month's newsletter I reviewed Quarterback 5.0. What I didn't realize at the time was that there was a fatal flaw in the program. Although everything might appear just fine during the backup process, it was not always possible to restore a backup made to floppies. That pretty much renders the backup useless. To solve the problem, Central Coast Software has issued a patch upgrading Quarterback 5.0 to Quarterback 5.01. If you use Quarterback you need to get this patch and make new backups of all your hard drive partitions with the new version.

Time for a short editorial comment. I find it pretty much inexcusable that Central Coast Software released a product that had a bug that serious. I find it even more inexcusable that they still haven't notified me, or, I suppose, any of their other registered users of the problem. Releasing a patch is fine, but it doesn't reach those who are either not active on BBS's or the major services, or those who are not members of good user groups where this kind of service is provided. It may be time to check out the competition more carefully.

Anyway, if you use Quarterback, be sure to get the upgrade patch on MCCC-A\_412.

## WB-Pies by Bill Raecke

Workbench. You need NickPrefs to use them. The correct palettes are included as well as an ARexx randomizing routine to select one at random at startup time. A couple of these are re dos of pictures included on earlier disks. I think the newer versions look better.

## Postscript Fonts

As always, there are a bunch of new Postscript fonts available for those of us who are PageStream users. On MCCC-A\_413 is a very nice display font called Slabface. And on MCCC-A\_417 are Harting, a font that looks like a well-worn typewriter; ShpFltNat, a font containing special characters for musical notation; International, which contains internationally recognized symbols; and Tabatha, a font that looks like something a 5-year old might write

Anyone getting tired of Workbench pictures yet? I have a hunch there are a few... but for those who like them, there are 8 more on MCCC-A\_ \_415. As before, these pictures are designed to run on a 16-color interlaced

![Image](1992_07_artifacts/image_000006_6118af4c712e59ddeac833988d50378613caa3a09195dcb655a47ab0d8839c70.png)

There are almost too many "mod" style music players to keep up with. I spent a few hours playing with this one and it really seems powerful. I'm not sure I can recommend it to the casual user because it seems a little on the complicated side... but if you want power and aren't afraid to read instructions you might want to give this one a try. Some of its features include the ability to point it at a directory and have it automatically play all the music it finds there and the ability to play selections in random sequence. You can play different tunes at different speeds and you can teach it to remember the specific speed for each tune so that next time it will correct itself automatically. Of course it handles all the various MOD, MED and Tracker formats. AmigaOS 2.0 is required. It's on MCCC-A\_417.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The Amiga By-The-Loop meeting for June was held at our normal meeting place, the North Richland Hills Community Center.

Our president, David Owens, started the evening's entertainment without his normal tongue, since he informed the gathered throng that MCCC sold floppy disks at 6 for a dollar! He very quickly corrected that error, put in his usual tongue, and proceeded with the evening's events. David reminded us that there is a subscription program for the library disks; however, at this time nobody is taking advantage of this service (see your local chapter librarian). The floor was then opened for questions and rumors. One member found his hard disk problem solved by calling on other members for their advice. Rumors and half truths pertained to 386SX BridgeBoard from Commodore in production and 1960 monitors replacing the old 1950's and UNIX is now a reality and you can buy it for any AMIGA equipped with an MMU.

A very interesting discussion followed based on conversations with various Commodore Reps, so you really should have been at the meeting!

Following this free-for-all David handed over the meeting to David Johnson of Ansoft Data Systems. David presented two pieces of software. The first was Pinball Dreams by 21st Century Entertainment. This is a first class GAME. Yes, game! Ansoft does apparently now sell some game software, but those games have to be something special. Pinball Dreams is one such game. If you have the chance, find someone who has a copy and ask to see it, then drive down to Ansoft and buy yourself a copy! It consists of four different tables each three screens high. The action is fast, furious and realistic.

Anyway, the second piece of software is Image Master from Black Belt systems. This is a package that is completely user configurable via ARexx. In fact, it relies on custom loaders to translate different graphics formats into various other formats similar to Art Department Professional. This is not the only thing that Image Master can do. David showed its morphing capabilities using a Porsche to a Camaro ("Yes, I know it should be the other way round, but it actually works better this way" ...David). He showed the point to point method of describing the morph. A cumbersome but very effective way of controlling the image. This package needs to be demonstrated to you so that you can fully appreciate the flexibility built into the software. Thank you, David for an excellent demonstration.

I should also mention that it was David Johnson's Wedding Anniversary on this Tuesday. So congratulations to both David and his wife. Also many thanks to David's wife for letting him out!!!

The evening ended with door prizes from Ansoft Data Systems. Bruce Nelson and Doug Gaudin (didn't he win last month?) won video rentals from Ansoft, and David Owens (fix???) and John Malmstrom won Color-Amiga-Mugs. Congratulations to all our winners and many thanks to Ansoft for their generosity.

The Loop chapter hopes to see you all at our next meeting in July when we will have a presentation given by INOVAtronics.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Happy Summer to all! Ill start this off with a Quote For Today. We were all discussing this-n-that and whether it would run on a "stock

Amiga"... seems there's hardly any such thing any more. Danny Barnett advised us that "Amiga" actually stands for "Another Modification Is Getting Around"! Seems true, with all the addons and gadgets we hear about! How 'bout a SEGA game interface, strongly rumored to be under development? (I hear that the SEGA games are developed on Amigas, so it shouldn't be too hard to believe.) Not a rumor, but a reality: there's a way to enter your own game world, not just imagine you're part of a 2-D adventure. At a "Dave &amp; Buster's" in town (various locations at different times) you can find an Amiga-based virtual reality game, said to be $4 for 4 minutes of play. Take on another human opponent in 3-D, in a battle complicated by the pesky pterodactyls ptrying to ptake you out! Call your nearest "Dave &amp; Buster's" for latest info on when and where the game is being run. Other virtual reality games were mentioned, too. Exciting! Sonia King from Metropolitan Computer had some assorted news for us, including a NewTek seminar coming up in August, and a new FAX modem and software for the Amiga that lists at $459. Also, we hear that the "Gold Service" extended warranty has been expanded to cover A500s, and can be picked up for around $49/year, even if you are not the original owner of the equipment. If your original warranty has expired, you'll have to have your system or peripheral checked out by a dealer before it can be covered. Great program! We then heard from Mark Henry on news from The Edge, which I imagine will be mentioned elsewhere in the newsletter. He then presented our Demo of the Month, during which I made seven pages of notes, so bear with me:

Mark Henry gave the How To Hook Up To A BBS lesson I've always wanted! He started out by explaining the mystery of the name "modem"... the device that

## CHAPTER NEWS

MODulates your computer's digital signals into audible tones phone lines can carry, and DEModulates the tones you receive back to digital signals. (OK, be honest... how many of you REALLY already knew that?) Another tidbyte: BAUD stands for "Bits AUDible" , or the rate at which characters come over the line, the "standard" being 2400 BAUD these days (a bit faster that you can read), which is the slowest thing on the market at present. A 2400 BAUD modem used to be considered incredibly fast, and cost around $250. Now they're as little as $75. Most modems are "Hayes compatible", which means they have a standard set of instructions they recognize (first established in Hayes brand modems). Now that you know all about modems, you need to connect one to your computer with a modem tions program is NComm (newest version in library), then Term2 and the shareware program JRComm (level 1.02A).

cable to your serial port. NOTE: A1000s require a specially-designed cable, as their configuration is not the same as other Amigas.

Once connected to the BBS of your choice, you will generally find options for four basic functions. First, you will find Bulletin Boards, where messages are "posted" for all to read, usually grouped by different areas of interest. Some messages may be "private E-Mail", only readable be those to whom it is specifically addressed. Second will be a "File Section" ", where text files, documentation, news, games, pictures and sound files, etc. may be found. If large, these files may be "archived" (compressed to save space and transmission time). The archiving programs LHA and PKZIP are most commonly used, and you can get a copy and decompress the files on your machine once you have them.

Now we need some software to talk to the modem and get data moving. There are many PD communications programs, and a purchased application is only $30-$50 (the benefits there being documentation and support). We have some in the library. Once you execute the communications program, it will likely offer you a "phone book" option, with a way to store phone numbers of BBSs you would like to access. After you select the phone number, the software will send word to the modem to call out, and hopefully the next thing you see will be a "Hello" logon screen from the BBS. In the Don't Ask Why Just Do It department, the most common parameters for local BBSs are "8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit". · Your software should have a place these answers go. Mark's favorite PD communica- several users can play simultaneously. Some BBSs are free, some charge a fee to help offset the costs of SYSOP (System Operator) time, hardware maintenance, phone bills, etc. Our own BBS is only a few bucks a year, and allows access to our extensive library of Public Domain software, as well as a large user base to help with problems and share news.

This brings us to "How Do I Get The Files on My Machine?", which seems very intimidating, but needn't be. There are several "protocols" established, like "XMODEM" "YMODEM", "ZMODEM" and "KERMIT". These each have their own way of verifying the correctness of the data over the line. If there is noise on the line, etc., the communications program will detect errors and "resend" the last chunk of data until it comes through OK. Your communications program may have different protocol options, and you need to match up with one the BBS can talk to. You can send your own files to the BBS (UPload), or ask for something from the BBS's library (DOWNload). The bigger the file,

Mark Henry's own Edge BBS runs on a PC at the store. Call 263-6816, or metro 9607017. Our own BBS is always listed in the newsletter on the "fine the longer the transmission time, which is something to keep in mind if you have a time limit or a long distance call. Mark says a 90 minute limit gives you just enough time to download a 400K file and check for messages.

print" page. Both lines are metro. There is also an Amiga SCOPE BBS, 288-1537, which charges $5 for access. Then there are the national networks like CompuServe, GEnie, and Portal (which has a lot of Amiga stuff). These charge varying fees for time used.

## CHAPTER NEWS

within our own BBS. Let me know at the meeting if you would be interested (I'1l pass a signup sheet or something) so we can figure how large a place it needs to be. I haven't even explored all the things it can do, myself, and it has changed software pretty recently, so we could use a brush-up even if we use it often. Mark certainly built up my confidence, though!

NEXT MONTH: We'll welcome Scott Lamb and his demo of VidDISC from Creotech, a multi-media application that runs on the CDTV. We may even see a mini-tour of the Amon Carter museum, which has been a part of their demo. Neat! Haven't forgotten our Door Prizes, provided this month by Metropolitan Computers: Bob Chancy won Cosmostruction, Bill Dryden won Air Strike USA, and John Cummings walked away with Botics. Forgive my spelling, please! I've been at Cub Scout Day Camp all week, and I left my brain under a rock somewhere. See you next month!

## Arl/Grand Prairie Brad Dumler

At the Arlington/Grand Prairie chapter meeting in June, our group saw a demonstration of a commercial C64 utility program called MATRIX.

Glen Herring had the honors of showing and telling about this, one of his latest acquisitions. The program allows some of the features of the C128 to be used while in C64 mode. It is not still being distributed, but it might be found in stores that deal in used software. Here is a good example of what wonderful things are still available for our 8-bit machines if we pay visits to some of the local electronics and pawn shops, and if we keep our eyes and ears open.

In upcoming meetings, our presentation topics will include C128 features and capabilities (July), word processing (August tentatively), and graphics September tentatively). As always, we hope to see you at the chapter meetings. Have a cool time until then.

## Fort Worth Mary Louise Hagemeyer

Our meeting place at TCOM was moved to a different building, causing us to play a game of mice-ina-maze trying to find an unlocked door and the right path through all the corridors to our reward. Our generous friends at TCOM have assured us that we will be back in our familiar room next month.

We enjoyed watching Budget Computer's video, "Introductory Telecomputing." At recent meetings there have been many questions from members about using modems and BBS's. This video goes through the process step by step, starting with connecting a non-CBM modem using an interface, then loading a terminal program and calling a BBS.

Next time we'll discuss printer programs, like Print Shop and

Newsroom. Bring samples of your work and problems you have encountered while printing. The meeting will be July 11, 1:30pm, in Room 540 at TCOM.

## H.E.B. Robyn Wilson

A discussion was held at the June Board of Directors meeting as to the future of the HEB Chapter of the MCCC. I, Robyn, as President of the Chapter, let the Board know of our diminishing membership and of the low number of officers currently taking part in the chapter. I asked for their opinion and then approval to disband the chapter. I am now taking steps to close our chapter. Phone calls have been made by now to our members and they have been advised of the change.

The people who have made the HEB Chapter a success for the last ten years have worked hard. They have enabled us to educate people in the use of the C64 and C128. I commend those members and the ones who upgraded their Commodore system and still came to the HEB Chapter and remained faithful.

their meetings. They will continue to educate you and others in how to use your C64 and C128. Look at the back page of the newsletter for locations and times of their meetings. Also remember that METCOM will be here in October. It is a good opportunity to buy 64/128 items.

All is not lost — please be sure that you have the utmost invitations from the Arlington/Grand Prairie and Fort Worth chapters to visit
