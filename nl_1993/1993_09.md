## BOOM BOX

## MUSK AS ENTERTANIMEIT BY WILLIE HUTT OF THE SACRAMENTO AMICA COMPUTER CLUB

oom Box is a music creation program that lends itself more to be an entertainment program than a serious music program. Boom Box comes on two floppy diskettes and is hard drive installable. It may also be run from floppies. The manual addresses both the Amiga and the IBM versions of the program and each version is easy to follow in the manual.

Boom Box has three different screens. When Boom Box comes up, it comes up with the Boom Box screen. When you play music, the speakers pulsate just like the real things and when you record a sound session, the little tape recorder reels move just like the real thing. To record something on the Boom Box screen, all that is required is to just hit record and then play on the Boom Box and the little cassette tape starts to move and you are recording. When Boom Box is loaded up and you have not loaded a different BOX file, Boom Box will start playing its default music file and wait for you to make an input. After making some good sound mixes that you like, they can be saved to disk.

The next screen is the Remix screen. The Remix screen is where you add echo and pitch shift, change tempo, and retrigger and loop measures. You can record all of these features on this screen and you can also insert your own samples and either raise or lower the volume just as you could in the Boom Box screen. The next screen is the Jam screen. With the Jam screen, you can access everything that is available in both the Remix and the Boom Box screens and you can change the music patterns in each. There are three sets of buttons on both the Jam and Remix screens. Only the Jam screen allows changes to be made to your sound files. The first set of buttons controls the drums, the second set of buttons controls the bass, and the third set of buttons controls the synth or keyboard. The fourth channel is for you to control the six sampled sounds.

Boom Box can use any IFF sound file. In addition to the ones that are provided on disk, they can be picked up from public domain disks, bulletin boards, Fred Fish, etc. There are two types of sound files used in Boom Box. The first set of files have a BOX extension on the file and can be purchased from Dr. T. The second type of sound file is called a Sound, and is a one-shot sample file. These sound samples will have been created with programs like ASound Elite and AudioMaster and are also found in the public domain.

Boom Box has strong support for keyboard equivalents to mouse and menu operations. I found controlling the FX and mixing sliders to be a lot more accurate and smooth using the keyboard instead of the mouse when small and gradual changes were needed in one of the mixes.

Boom Box, as I said in the beginning, is an entertainment piece of software that can provide hours of fun for those music lovers that don't want to spend a lot of time trying to learn to make music. Boom Box is easy to use and all ages will find it fun. Talked to Dr. T and asked about upgrades to the program. Was told that there will be some new sound files added from time to time. So, if you want to have some fun with music, then Boom Box is for you. If you are a musician and doing serious things with music like playing in a band or writing music, then Boom Box may not be for you. The only thing that I found wrong with Boom Box was its price. I feel that the price should come down a little. Remember, this is only my opinion. Your kids will love playing with the Boom Box.

## Computer Wars SupraTurbo 28

by Charles H. Ferguson &amp; Charles R Morris book review by Steven F. Nichols his book cleared away my personal cobwebs, my misconceptions and my ignorance; all in one fell swoop! Ever wonder how Intel and Microsoft came to occupy the lofty heights of the PC world. Outstanding design? Lofty vision? Great marketing? Not hardly! As a hardcore Amigaite, with work-related IBM clone exposure, I naturally dis' IBM and the Clone Sisters; as in, Disrespect, Disdain and Dismiss! Yet, this book manages to increase my dis' ratio. Applause, Applause!

The first 100 pages of this treatise is subtlely entitled, "The Fall of IBM"; owing to the fact that IBM was ensconced at the top of the computing world at one time. Straight from the dazzling debut of the System/360, IBM was king with the revolutionary new principle of compatibility and expandability. Instead of replacing outdated equipment with a new system, a customer in the 360 circle could add-on as needed. IBM could even emulate the 1400 software, so customers could easily transfer their old 1400 programs. Yet, IBM eventually became the dinosaur of the industry; but not before its revolutionary PC launched others to fame and riches.

"Winning in a Post-IBM World" graces the first page of Part II. This section covers the struggle between the "vertical manufacturing" prowess of Japan, and the "innovative expertise" of America. The book necessarily becomes drier in writing style as it moves from the past to the future. The book was published this year (1993), and I'm the first to have checked it out from my library. The authors stay in safe territory, as this section covers existing technologies that are recently released or are soon-to-be released; products that should shape the computing world in the near future.

Part III discusses "Prospects and Opportunities." A well thought-out review of possible strategies and scenarios that American and Japanese companies are likely to pursue in the future. The authors believe IBM will survive as a "right-sized" entity. Personally, I believe IBM lost it when Watson, Jr. retired and the MBA's took over. You know the type. 'Nuff said! Naturally, they also cover many of the premier players in this soon to be "World's Largest Industry." The computing future of the masses looks bright as the Clone Sisters move into territories pioneered by Commodore and Apple, even though the base is a rickety construct such as Intel's microprocessor and MS-DOS software. As one leading text put it, MS-DOS is "obsolete, primitive... a bad dream...dragged to a fame it never deserved." Scant comfort for better platforms; when IBM compatibles are over 80% of the US market.

the economical way to speed things up by Rodger Padgett, Compuserve

've been a beta tester for a device called the Most well informed or well read Amigoids know about it already. Amiga World has run the ad for it the last several months, even though Supra hasn't officially released it for sale.

Quite simply, the SupraTurbo is an inexpensive way to make your Amiga 500 or 2000 run faster than a stock Amiga 1200 and 2/3 as fast as the Amiga 3000. For about $200, you get a SupraTurbo 28 (500 or 2000 version - the only difference is the case the 500 version comes in). You also get a well written manual and a program called SupraTurbo.

Installation is easy. On the 500, you remove the expansion access panel on the side of the computer, if it isn't already. Remove the expansion pass-through on the ST28 case if you have a hard drive or memory expansion. The ST28 has to be closest to the computer. Install your other devices (HD or memory module) and then turn on the ST28 switch, then your machine.

It is just as easy to install on the 2000. You do have to install the on/off switch so it goes outside your case if you intend to use it. You could jumper the ST28 to leave it on, but I don't recommend that.

One word of caution, if you are using a GVP Series II A500-HD+ with memory installed., you have to make sure the ROM is version 3.14 or higher. Mine wasn't (I had the 3.07 ROM), so I called GVP and had them send me their FaastRom Upgrade kit. Until I got it, I was dead in the water if I wanted to use my hard drive while accelerated. I could use it in turbo mode as long as 1 was accessing memory or floppy. Since installing the new 4.14 ROM, I've been flying at 28.4 Mhz. ProPage is faster (it actually keeps up with my typing now.)

I haven't found anything that isn't compatible yet! I don't expect to. My system is an Amiga 500 with a fully populated Baseboard (4 megs of memory), B-Pal option on the Baseboard, 2.04 ROM with WB 2.1, a GVP SII Z500 + with 4 megs of memory and now the SupraTurbo 28.

All in all, I am very excited over the SupraTurbo 28. It is a fine product from a really caring company. Supra is definitely in it for the long haul with Amiga. If your dealer hasn't gotten it yet, ask them to order one. /

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke racker Music, anyone? We have the usual Taba Dog bis or te mont tre trie ned disks. My pick of the month is a terrific new version of Pachelbel's Canon in D that can be found on MCCC-A\_580.

While we're talking about audio, MCCC-A\_580 contains a selection of small sound samples. These are designed primarily to use as system sounds under AmigaOS 2.1 and greater but, of course, they can be used any way you see fit. There's some interesting stuff here.

And if you need something to play all those tracker tunes with, on MCCC-A\_579 you'll find a new player. Eagle Player is probably the most powerful tracker player I have run across...powerful in that it plays all the MOD and MED formats I have thrown at it. NO other player to date has been able to do that. Eagle Player has a couple of big drawbacks, however. The docs are written in German, so it's up to you to figure out how it works..of course the program itself is in English so that's not really too hard. Of more importance, however, is the fact that Eagle Player will play only one tune at a time. Scripting or the ability to play a directory of tunes is not provided for. But if you don't need those features then this is definitely one to take a look at.

Enough audio for a while. Mandelbrot programs are another way for you to while away a few hours — or (if you're like me) a large portion of your spare time. It's been a while since we had a new Mandelbrot exploration program and this one is well worth your time. It's called MandelMania 4.0. It has several things going for it, not the least of which is speed. This thing is FAST! For comparison I timed the basic Mandelbrot on my machine (a 68030 running at 33mhz). I made sure the screen modes were the same and the iterations setting was the same (32). Then timed MandelPAUG, the fastest Mandelbrot program I had to date and compared it to the new MandelMania. MandelPAUG took 11 seconds to complete the basic Mandelbrot MandelMania took just 4. Remarkable! Need more reason to check it out? How about the fact that it supports all the Amiga display modes, even the

new AGA options. Or how about the fact that it will work in overscan. Or how about the fact that it supports the Julia and Lyapunov sets as well and can even generate 3D pictures. You can scroll around using the cursor keys and you can build animations. All in all it's pretty complete. You'll need to check this one out. It's on MCCC-A\_581.

Want to play a game? This month sees the addition of Robouldix to our library. Robouldix is another Boulder Dash style game. This one is not a clone, but it is a VERY nice game with excellent graphics, entertaining music, and puzzles that will make you pull your hair out. The point, as with all Boulder Dash type games is to collect all the collectibles on the screen within the allotted time without getting trapped or squashed by falling boulders or killed by various monsters. The version included here is just a demo version, but it's fully playable. The full version is available from the authors, Patrik Grip-Jansson and Svante Berglund in Sweden, for $27. Look for this one on MCCC-A\_583.

## The Compression Kit

preview of a new C64 product by George Page his is a preliminary review of The Compression Kit, just released by Madman Software, inc. For more information, see the full review in either issue 4 or issue 5 of Volume 2 of CEE64 Alive! (not sure of publication issue at this time).

The CKit is a C64 backup/archival utility that allows you to file copy, copy whole disks ('41, "71 or '81), or copy full CMD native partitions (on any of CMD's large capacity drives or RAM devices). Alternately, it allows you to compress any of the preceding formats into one file of unlimited size, or you can select maximum file sizes in which the compressed data is stored (For flexibility in uploading or storage). It contains powerful error recovery and verify features that claim to make it more reliable than standard copiers and archivers. The CKit disk itself is un-protected, but uses a dongle plugged into joyport one as protection.

was handy, DEDIT 128 V7.0, at 141 blocks. Then, for full disk comparisons, I used an old Gazette disk that occupied 338 blocks. I also tried Fast Hack'm V6.04, which showed 398 blocks used (which was not actually true, due to hidden files). I used the more common pre-existing archivers on the same data sources as well, for comparison. The accompanying table shows the results. Times are in minutes &amp; seconds. File lengths are in Commodore blocks.

## Notes:

1. The *'s follow archival formats that would not function after de-archiving (due to the hidden files).
2. The Zipcode Il file utilities saved each source file as two files that totaled the given finished length.

For the purposes of this pre-review, I tested the compression routines only on the following data sources. First was a 115 block sequential file buffer dump from the FIDO CBM echo. Next I grabbed a small program that

3. All tests were done using a C128 (in 64 mode as appropriate), two 1571's, with no auxiliary fast loaders active, except ZIPCODE II, which was run on a C64 &amp; two 1541's, due to its DOS limitations. A 512K REU was used with LHA.
4. Software based fastloaders are generally incompatible,

however JiffyDOS or similar utilities will speed access up accordingly. Also, times would be faster using faster devices. For instance, the 115 block program file took only 1:11 to compress with verify from a RAMLink to an FD4000 drive using JiffyDOS.

The menus and layout of The Compression Kit were more user friendly than a number of other utilities. Its big drawback lies in the fact that at this time there are no stand-alone utilities to decompress archives made with the program. It also does not make use of a RAM expander, and will not work on GEOS files (but a full disk archiver will work). All I can say is compare the times and compression, and make your own decision. If you just have a C64, then this would be useful. However, using the faster 128 utilities would appear to be the way to go for 128 users, except for the CMD Native partition utilities and a few other considerations such as file length or type of program being archived, and the verifying/error checking functions.

## For New Users

general information to help you along from the Catman SYSOP Noodle Ranch after hours BBS

An "assign" is a bit of information, more or less, you're giving to your Amiga when it starts up. It tells it where to look for certain programs, certain files, etc.

And where are assigns made, you ask? They are made in the S: directory, in a file called "startupsequence" or "user-startup." Usually. So...let's say that we wanted to assign a logical device name called "Eat\_Me:" on your Amiga. Use a text editor and open up your "user-startup" file. Now, go to the area of the file that you see the word "assign." With me so far? OK... Now, point your mouse pointer at the end of the last line that starts with the word ASSIGN and hit RETURN. Let's say you had a program in a directory which you called "Stupid \_Programs." To assign "Eat \_Me:" in this instance, type:

ASSIGN Eat\_Me: dhO:Stupid\_Programs

Watch your spelling. Watch your spaces.

If you have program that JUST WON'T WORK for ANYTHING, try assigning it. It might work then. If it still doesn't work, either dump the sucker or find out why it isn't working. Your choice.

There are some programs that you must assign the volume name to the corresponding directory on your hard drive, in the startup-sequence (user-startup) or they just won't work, period. Live with it. It's not that bad.

## How do I get my amiga to make sounds or to talk?

Easy...First, the Amiga was made for sounds, eh. You can go out and buy all kinds of totally neato programs for generating or manipulating sounds. The Amiga comes with a "resident" program ("resident" meaning that it essentially "resides" with the basic system) called "SAY." If you ask me, "SAY" is relatively obnoxious. It will give you a "computer voice." Read the manual, dink around with it. I'm sure you'll begin to hate it as much as the rest of us soon.

As far as other sounds, here's where the fun starts. Let's say that you have a program file called "Scream. IFF." That's a "sound file" of a man screaming. How do you listen to it? How can you get your Amiga to play it for you! First, put the program SOUND into your c: directory. If it isn't there already, find a disk that has the SOUND program on it, open a CLI window and type: cd dio: (hit return)

## copy SOUND c: (hit return)

Presuming that the file "scream iff" is on that same

If you're working on a disk-drive system with NO harddrive, just type this instead: cd dfo: (hit return) copy SOUND RAM: (hit return)

disk, type: cd ram: (Hit return) sound df0:scream.iff

Brace yourself, you're going to hear a scream.

## How can I view pictures?

Again, there are different kinds of picture (or "pic") files. The standard Amiga can view iff, ham, llbm files, but you will need special viewing programs for sham, gif, tiff, pox, etc, pic files. 24 bit picture viewing will require the monitor and emulation software that will allow you to view the 24 bit pics (Ham.E, etc.). Again, play around with the system and you'll learn as you go along.

The same thing you did for hearing sounds holds true for seeing pictures. The only difference is that you are dealing with a viewing utility program instead of a sound utility program and the file you're dealing with is a picture, not a sound. Just follow the same steps as above, but instead of "PLAY", type M (for Mostra), and instead of scream.iff, type in the name of the picture file you want to view.

## How do I copy or save a file?

Easy. Let's say you have a file in RAM: named "SAVE\_ME" and you want to save it to your disk (dfo:). Just type:

cd ram: (hit return) copy SAVE\_ME dU: (hit return)

That's it. The system will copy the file onto your disk. d

Johnny Kitchens

The August meeting drifted from the normal by mixing the rumors and question answer session together. After mentioning METCOM, which comes to us in November, everything began flying. Someone asked why there were no Amiga clones. Maybe it's the same reason for no Mac clones - then again, maybe not. The topic to really stir things up was Brilliance. Apparently this long-awaited piece of software has really excited many with its apparent abilities, and disappointed just as many with the dongle protection. It appears they may lose some sales with this device. A rumor was next...about Sony distributing CDTV. That could be interesting!' A new dealer in Plano was mentioned next. Hopefully we'll hear more of them in the future. NewTek's Screamer was brought up, but apparently until we can see it, judgment will be pending. The latest in 24 bit cards for the Amiga were discussed. Retina, Merlin, and Picasso II give 2000, 2500, and 3000 owners a future to look forward to. A question on how to get high density floppies into the 500 was brought up. It's not as easy as other Amigas but not impossible. Someone told of their problems installing 2.1 and the resulting problem encountered with floppies, and a crazy happening with his Startup-Sequence. A little help hopefully cleared it up. Should one download to floppies if they have a hard drive? In this day and time, I don't think so! A problem with the Super DMAC chip in the 3000 that can cause problems with the hard drive was given some discussion. Someone asked what Commodore was doing lately. A concerted effort to kick Gould out was one suggestion. Someone asked for a printer driver for the HP.4 for use with PageStream. Mentioning this brought up a question of where is PageStream 3.0? Coming soon! Is there a PD program like Art Department Pro? That would be nice. Is there a way to convert one type of music file to another? Another nice thing to have! Someone asked about a program to list instruments in DMCS music files. Why, yes, there is one! CanDo was mentioned or should I say thoroughly discussed. With the latest version comes the end of being able to freely distribute the programs you create. A licensing fee is now required. Though the program has been improved in some exciting ways, the fee may hinder it. Hopefully the error of this will come to light.

For our main presentation, TypeSmith, a very powerful font editor, was presented by Bill Raecke. With this program an Amiga user can edit outline fonts or even create his own design. After showing the basic settings to get started, Bill showed us the creative process. You can't help but be amazed at how easy it is to create things with the Amiga. You should have been there! If you were there then you have an advantage over those who were absent. TypeSmith continues the Amiga's invasion of the desktop publishing world. Desktop publishing really has quite a following in the Amiga world and this addition certainly adds a new dimension to the fun.

We had a smallish crowd present in August... where was everybody? But the chat was interesting and the demo was cool and the less people there, the better my chances for a doorprize. (heh, heh!) Chapter alert: our librarian William Dockendorf is seeking new employment, and if he finds it out of the area, we'll need a new librarian ASAP! Can you devote some time filling this much valued position? William sits back there month after month and quietly fills your requests for club disks...not a flashy position but a vital one, as sharing data and software is one of the main benefits of our club. Consider our need and your availability! Our proposed move of the chapter meetings to the King of Glory Lutheran Church (near Preston &amp; LBJ is still pending, with the suggested meeting day set to the third TUESDAY of each month. Comments? Problems? Call Danny Barnett and discuss your opinions. We will possibly move in October, details at the meeting. On the subject of the next meeting, we are still hoping to hear about the latest CanDo update, but no commitment had been made as of this writing. Danny or Brett can tell you what's up as the date approaches. Here's an interesting "confirmed rumor": there's a new Amiga dealer in Plano! I found the place in Ruisseau Village near where Mervyns used to be, at Parker &amp; Central, and peeked in the window. Yup, there was an Amiga in there! They weren't open that Saturday, and I saw no "store hours" signs. Perhaps some of us can drop in during the week and see what they have. Another rumor: watch for a new version of ParNet coming, able to link IBM and Amiga system, said to be released recently. Dave Byrne had lots of interesting bits of information about New Stuff, like the "Amiga CD32" 32-bit CD machine coming out now in Europe, as competition for other CD game machines. Look for an announcement in the US on September 10th! Would be great to have it shipping by Christmas. Dave also has much enthusiasm and many details for "Retina" , a graphics board that has so many options I couldn't keep up with him. It emulates AGA so you can use the newest DPaint, and level 1.4 software has speeded

up scrolling. We'll get to see this package at the next meeting! Tom Brooks has a new BBS we are invited to visit. Call 272-9476, 24-hours a day, no time limits (yet). He's running CNet at 9600 BAUD - can anyone help him with setup? The themes at present are Amiga/IBM or Artificial Intelligence — Al for either! Brett Hester told us about INOVAtronics' newest CanDo, which has a gotcha: you (the programmer) must pay a $100 license fee for each product you distribute which uses the CanDo library, which will no longer be bound into your deck. He also relayed the news that NewTek has a new toaster accelerator, nicknamed "The Screamer", due out early next year. Rendering times are expected to go from hours to minutes, but the price is steep: $10,000. Prices not so steep: Danny Barnett is saying farewell to his A500 with 1 meg of

RAM, an external drive, monitor and a Nice Little Case, yours for just $350, and his AMAS sound sampler/midi interface (hardware, software, &amp; docs) is offered for $75. Geary Hughes had a GVP 40 mhz 030 accelerator board for your 2000, with 4 meg of RAM, available for $350. Check with him at (817) 4688234 or metro (817) 467-6768.

We have a one-time-only opportunity to get a group discount on the Terminus terminal package within the next month. This package has a BASIC-based scripting language, supports ARexx, and has several different terminal emulations including IBM. Console definition files can save your setups for several different BBSs or other connections. Terminus is normally $40, and the offer is for $10 off and no shipping/handling fee. If you are interested, call Dave Byrne (quickly!)

at 625-6615, and he will coordinate our group purchases.

Our presentation for the evening was "Brilliance Professional Paint and Animation," by Digital Creations, Inc. Brett Hester put this package swiftly through its paces. It runs on all Amigas, even an A500, requiring 2 meg of RAM (4 meg preferred) and a couple of floppies. Digital Creations brought us DCTV, and this looks a bit like it in some ways, such as "toolboxes" instead of pull-down menus. For example, you select an airbrush with the left mouse button, and the right mouse button on the same icon gives you access to the airbrush control options on a toolbox window. Brilliance has most of the features of DPaint, with the notable exception of the "spirograph tool". It DOES have a multi-level UNDO (for those who realize the mistake was

quite a while ago...), and a nifty "mirror" feature for making symmetrical designs. One of its most interesting tricks is "bezier curves" - plot 4 points and it calculates a curve to connect them, which you can then bend and stretch like the 2point curve we're more familiar with. The package has the anim brushes and the "move" function of DPaint. There were 30 functions on the main screen, and 15 different "pen tips." Brett pronounced the brush tools "incredible." One extra touch was "varied transparency" , so your anim brush image can gradually appear out of darkness. Neat effect! There's also morphing, and a very handy little title box that tells you what your mouse pointer is hovering over as you move over the buttons in the toolbox. Brilliance comes with a Very Nice Manual, and a "dongle" for copy protection: if you don't have this device plugged into your joystick port, you don't run the program. As an incentive to switch, they offer a substantial discount if you send in your old paint program! When Brett started talking about the corners of a circle, and confessed "I don't know how to STOP it yet... " , we knew it was time to wrap it up. Nice job, Brett!

Yep, doorprizes. Metropolitan Computers sent us Photolab (many hungered after that one!), Stellary, and Quadralien, and Dave Byrne offered Turbo Challenge 2 and Wrath of the Demon. We appreciate MCP and Dave for their generosity! See ya next month, same time &amp; place (for at least one more month.

## Fort Worth Brenda Sessums

Hello Hurst, Grand Prairie... need a Mapsco? Like to be in the new book? The Dunn Family is Missing" a new novel on the 64 (just kidding!). And remember, anyone with a Commodore fettish is openly welcome at our monthly meetings.

We had 13 people present at our last electric meeting. (No one was shocked, though.) John Burt demonstrated from the library, Disk #537 which had a nifty check book program. It had room for 820 transactions and was easy to use since it was menu driven. It does reports, has categories and disk utilities. There is room for memos and for making note of taxable items. There is also a 64 version for dollars only (it has no cents) on the same disk.

John also demonstrated a car comparison program for up to four different cars. It makes a really professional (sort of) printout that you could take to a dealer and see if he would meet that price! (This may not be necessary in 1994 if they set prices like they said they would. All car stickers would be non-negotiable. Do you really believe that? I don't. So just keep the program and some printing paper handy!)

Disk #730 had Checking for the 128 from Pegasus PD Software. There is a database program for sorting your shoes (if you have 300 like I do), or maybe even organizing your software disks! It prints out a report for expenditures by type. It has password protection (so you can

![Image](1993_09_artifacts/image_000006_f06bf7764e6ef0c78de1b9eb2b6b1de87bd4c43921ed3c40cc850b777d99c124.png)

There was a program called CSX-7, an unpacker for downloaded programs, and an offline reader for the 128. The offline reader for the 64 is called Quickie and requires a separate unpacker CSX0100 or 101. This can be found on System Control BBS (268-0024) or MCCC BBS (2684196). There is a dollar a month charge on MCCC.

do all your private organizations) and docs for the checkbook program. There is a lotto program, a Drink and Drive Rater, a sequential file reader, a draw and paint program with a color demo which has joystick control and a clear, easy interface. There is a note jotter (which is a quick word processor with printing capabilities).

There is a company called VTECK at 2223 Rebecca, Hatfield, PA, 19440, which has printer ribbons and re-inking sets. There is a GEOS shell done by Maurice Randall at P.O. Box 606, Charlette, MI 48813. The shell is $24.95 for Version 2.2.

How about starting a child or pet directory if one gets lost in your neighborhood? It could also include senior citizens and absent-minded middle-aged computer people. You could do it for your church or any organization you are affiliated with. Programs called Superbase or Superscript would work great for this. They can be purchased from CMD at 1-800-638-3263 for the 128.

By the way, don't bother going to North East Mall looking for Commodore software or support at Software Etc. any more. They have stopped carrying all of their Commodore items nationwide. We stopped by last week and the salesmen were rude and offensive about us asking about Commodore programs.

John, remember to bring Little Computer People to the September meeting at the regular spot. (Our November meeting will be in Room 406 at TCOM.)
