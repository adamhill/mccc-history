## Miracle

## the piano teaching system by Bernie Joiner, Catalina Commodore Computer Club

t certainly is a miracle that somebody has finall I managed to make learning to play the piano fun, but ·that's exactly what The Software Toolworks people have done with The Miracle Piano Teaching System presently on sale at various electronic stores for $399.95!

Here's what you get for your money... The 49-key Miracle keyboard with pressure-sensitive keys (built-in MIDI connections), 128 digitized instrument voices and sound effects, split keyboard option allowing different sounds to be played by right and left hands, built-in 4" stereo speakers, plug-in power adaptor, stereo earphones, foot pedal for sustain, cabling, manuals, and three disks.

Here's how you set it up... Just plug the keyboard into you Amiga's serial port, install the disks to your hard drive (hard drive is not required to run the program, however), turn on the power and boot-up!

Here's how it starts... There are a couple of manuals included in the package, but you can just start right in with the first screen and let the Miracle lead you through all the necessary steps.

Here's how it works.. The Miracle is broken down into six work areas, all of which are accessible via the main menu screen with a click of the mouse. The six areas are:

1. The Classroom
2. The Arcade
3. The Practice Room
4. The Performance Hail
5. Administration
6. The Studio

When you first enter the world of The Miracle Piano Teaching System conservatory you are escorted to Administration where you register your name and whether you're an ADULT or CHILD. Next you are carted off to The Classroom where you are given your first lesson via the electronic chalkboard. These lessons involve reading, listening, and playing. The Miracle is a very patient teacher. If you are having problems, it will lead you carefully back through the lesson until you are up to speed before allowing you to continue. Once you have finished your current lessons in The Classroom, you are then sent to The Arcade to bag some ducks, or to parachute, or play Aliens. These simple arcade games are The Miracle's fun way of teaching note and chord sightreading. It really is amazing how quickly I've been able to learn music notation with this method!

Now back to the classroom for some more lessons before being packed off to The Practice Room where you'll work on your current songlist. In The Practice Room you can work on your rhythm without worrying about the notes, or just the notes to a song without worrying about the rhythm. Once you've got a handle on the notes and rhythm, you're off to your first recital in The Performance Hall where you will play your newly learned song with The Miracle Orchestra. If all goes well with your recital, you are sent scurrying off to Administration to print out your first certificate of achievement. Then back to The Classroom for your next lesson!

The Studio is a seven track recording deck. When you're not busy taking lessons you can record your own compositions using any of the 128 instruments at your command.

The Miracle even has a Jukebox in The Arcade area where you can sit back and relax while listening to one of any of the 250 selections presently available in your songlist.

It's The Miracle, and it's fun and educational.

## Vektor Storm

a great new action game from INOVAgames reviewed by Harold Williams

NOVAtronics is well known for outstanding products entered into the game market with the introduction of Vektor Storm through their new game division, INOVAgames.

Vektor Storm is a fast paced game, very much like the old classic arcade game, Tempest. The graphics are of the vector variety, and consequently the action is amazingly fast. The game includes some very impressive stereophonic sound.

Vektor Storm has an introductory story about being lost in an anomaly of the space-time continuum (a black hole) and entering an alternate universe - but forget all that malarky. This is a straight-forward "shoot it if it moves...shoot it if it doesn't move" game. There are a variety of alien ships that attack, and you have opportunities for weapon upgrades, extra lives, etc. The interesting aspect of this game is the movement of your spaceship. Your ship is placed on a three dimensional grid, and you can only navigate along the outer edge. There are 25 lunique screens. Each with its own different grid pattern (one is upside down...uh, maybe you can't be

upside down in space, but it sure felt that way).

Vektor Storm comes with a small instruction guide. You only need to briefly glance through it. But they did leave out one important thing. During the game you are occasionally given a password (every five levels) that will let you restart the game at the current level. The instructions don't mention the password system and there is no obvious way to use the passwords once you have obtained them. But Ill let you in on the secret. To use a password, press the space bar on the opening animation screen (the one with the four geometric objects spinning about). You will then be asked for a password. Simply type it in and the game will "warp" to the correct level.

Vektor Storm can be played with either mouse, joystick or keyboard...and it is easily installed on a hard disk. Just drag the Vektor Storm drawer to your hard drive. (Isn't that the way it's supposed to be done on an Amiga?)

I really like this game. I wasn't sure I would when I first started playing it, but I quickly got hooked. It is simple, fast paced, unique.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

Y racker Music This month there is more than the usual amount of Tracker music added to the library. In all, there are nine disks which are entirely or partially full of music. As usual, much of it is not worth the time it takes to listen to it, but, also as usual, there are some real standout pieces as well. My picks of the month are ASDEGHJKL's Revenge on MCCC-A\_469; Scrambled Mind and Thesmorphia on MCCC-A\_470; Options 1 and Options 2 from MCCC-A\_472; Sea of Love on MCCCA 473; Equinoxe on MCCC-A\_475; and Rendez-vous on MCCC-A\_476;

## Pictures

This month there are some truly outstanding JPEG pics. JPEG pictures present something of a problem because they must be converted into HAM or 16-color hires to be viewed by most of us. (Of course anyone with the new AGA chipset on a Amiga 1200 or 4000 will have an easier time coming up with an acceptable image.) Because of this problem, I don't normally feature JPEG pictures in my writeups, but these images are so outstanding I needed to mention them here. There are three pictures on MCCC-A\_471: Heelstone is a picture of Stonehenge taken at sunrise; Mona is a digitization of the Mona Lisa; and Sopwith is an artist's rendering of a Sopwith Camel...the World War I bi-plane. And there is one more picture on MCCC-A\_475: Harvest is a digitized image of a sugar maple harvest compete with horse-drawn wagon.

## ViewTek by Thomas Krehbiel

Here is the answer to those pesky JPEG pictures — and to GIF pictures as well. ViewTek can view both those formats directly...no conversion required. And it handles all the other popular Amiga formats as well. It won't do as good a conversion as The Art Department Professional but ADPro is a little unwieldy to use as a picture viewing

Harvest — from MCCC-A 1\_475

## Soft-Logik Upgrades

There are a couple of upgrades available this month for owners of some of Soft-Logik's products. On MCCCA 473 is a patch to upgrade BME version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.2 — and on MCCC-A\_475 is a patch to upgrade PageLiner from version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.2.

## GPFax 2.21

While we're on the subject of upgrades, there is an upgrade to GPFax on MCCCA 478. This patch will take owners of GPFax to version 2.21. There are a number of improvements in this version as well as bug-fixes.

## Print Drivers

For owners of the new Hewlett Packard DeskJet 550C, MCCC-A \_478 contains a Workbench print driver. And for those fortunate enough to have one of Hewlett Packard's new Laserdet IV printers, there is a print driver for that one as well. The LaserJet IV can print at up to 600 dpi. It's on the top of my wish list. Think how much better this newsletter could look at twice the resolution!

300 dpi rather than the full 600 dpi, it produces a very clean output - and does it more quickly than the standard DeskJet printer driver.

## Lyapunovia by desper Juul

A few months ago in this column I featured a program that could produce mathematical drawings from the Lyapunov set. These pictures are different from Mandelbrots and are just as much fun to explore. But the problem with the earlier program was that it lacked a nice Amiga interface and it was SLOW (with a capital S 1. O W). In order to generate picture, you needed to enter coordinates and other picture information by hand and then wait long periods of time to see what you had come up with. Lyapunovia takes care of those problems. This program offers a simple point and click interface that we have become accustomed to on Mandelbrot programs. To zoom in, pick your location with the mouse and drag a box around the area to be zoomed in on. The speed is comparable to most Mandelbrot programs. There are load and save features for coordinates, pictures and palettes. Coordinates are saved

within the picture files as well so you may load in an existing picture as a starting point and then explore from there.

Speaking of settings, there are 27 coordinate files, 14 sample pictures and 16 palettes included with the distribution. This gives you some very nice starting places. If you like exploring mathematical spaces you'll love Lyapunovia. It can be found this month on MCCCA 474.

## Magic Menu by Martin Korndorfer

menus available on any

You should have upgraded to AmigaOS 2.0 by now...or perhaps even 2.1. Well, you probably noticed that everything looks better than it did with AmigaDOS 1.3 EXCEPT the menus. AmigaOS 2.0 kept the same old two-color menus...no 3-D effects, no fancy borders, no improvement at all. Well Magic Menu is on hand now to fix that shortcoming. Simply add Magic Menu to your WBStartup drawer and you'll have the spiffiest looking machine, anywhere.

Actually Magic Menu does more than just improve the appearance of your menus. It also adds a new type of menu and allows you to customize menu operation as well. The new type of menu is a pop-up menu. If you press your right mouse button, a menu strip appears under your mouse pointer - no matter where the pointer is on the screen. If your pointer is on the standard menu bar, the standard menus will appear (but with a 3D 100k), Anyway, this is how it works by default. From there you can customize the setup to your liking. You can turn off either menu type. In other words, you can disable the new documentation is in German. You have to try the options to figure out how they work. But trying things is half the fun isn't it? There is a configuration window (available through Exchange — Magic Menu is a commodity) that allows you to change the configuration on the fly and then save it so it operates that way the next time automatically. I don't think it could be much easier to use. I haven't felt a need for documentation. You ought to give this one a try. I've been using it for several weeks now and it has performed flawlessly. Look for it on MCCC-A\_475.

## Workbench Brushes

Well, I haven't converted any pictures for use as Workbench backgrounds this month — but you don't get off that easily. This month there are some brushes available that can be used in the same way. These are some Escher patterns which, when repeated using the Tile option, form an nice plane-filling pattern of the sort

This screen capture shows the Magic Menu control panel. One of the Escher style patterns is in the background.

![Image](1993_01_artifacts/image_000008_4a6583fbf0898276792306e357a004e877dbf24102f565c7e40ed42a9477da2f.png)

pop-up menus or you can disable the standard menus so that you get only the pop-up type even when your mouse is in the menu bar when you press the right mouse button. You can have your menus appear with either a single border or with a double border. You can have them operate as regular Amiga menus do (so that you must keep the button pressed until you get to the proper item and then release the button to select it) or you can have them operate as menus do on an IBM (where you activate the menu, release the button, and then click on your selection). There are a number of other options as well.

Escher is famous for. There are two patterns this month. They're both on MCCC-A\_476.

## ClipArt

Last month we had some belated Halloween clipart added to the library. This month it's Christmas clipart that gets added too late to matter this year. But even though it's too late to be used for Christmas 1992, Christmas 1993 is right around the corner. Collect it now, while you know where it is. It's on MCCC-A\_476 and MCCC-A 477.

There is one disadvantage to the program. The

## Computer Gezks

the care and feeding of same by Mark and Tracy Lautenschlager, geek and spouse from the PC Users Group of Boca Raton, Florida

K, let's suppose that the unthinkable has *grin a pore hat the yacht hate here. living with a bona fide "computer geek". At first, the shock of discovery leaves you cold and numb. Then you begin to look for help. A frantic search of the yellow pages reveals no "Geeks Anonymous", and phone calls to your family doctor yield only ridicule. What can you do?

Have no fear, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Armed with the proper rules of conduct, you can peacefully coexist with your computer geek. But there are a few things you must understand first.

Being a computer geek is not something your geek is likely to recover from. Computer geeks do not view their condition so much as something they "do" but rather as a "way of life". Attempting to change a computer geek is like trying to teach a pig to sing - it frustrates you, and it only amuses the pig. Accept that living with a computer geek requires a life-long commitment to things "computerish" and settle in for the long haul.

Next, don't feel bad if your computer geek tries to turn you into a computer geek also. If you resist this pressure, you're probably entirely normal. You see, it's an unwritten law that computer geeks must reproduce themselves. But for the uninitiated, there is nothing quite so terrible as an evening spent with people speaking entirely in acronyms. Be firm with your computer geek, tell him (or her) no, but then expect to lose him several evenings a month as he goes to his computer geek "inbreeding sessions"

Finally, remember that computer geeks are not bad people. And the next time your mother needs a lastminute plane reservation and your computer geek gets into the online airline guide at 3:00 in the morning to accommodate her, you'll feel pride that he's done something useful with the infernal machine. Be careful, though! Such thoughts as those are often the first fateful steps down the road toward your own "geekdom".

Now, on to the rules for the care and feeding of your computer geek.

## - Rule #1 -

Never expect your computer geek to tire of his computer. It still amazes my wife that I can come home from a day filled with working on computers and spend my evening playing with them. I have to admit, it is a unique situation. Let's face it, people who dig ditches for a living don't often come home and uproot the backyard for relaxation. But being a computer geek is not like building a shed, or waxing your pickup truck. Every day, there are new things to read about, different programs to try out. Being a computer geek is like having a permanent pass to

Epcot Center. You spend half of your time acquiring new things to play with, and the other half of your time in awe of the things you've acquired.

## — Rule #2 -

Never believe your computer geek when he tells you that the latest item of hardware or software is the "last thing he will ever need". This is a common lie that all computer geeks tell. And, after a while, we know it's a lie. Oh, at first we don't. We honestly think that whatever item we're contemplating purchasing is the "ultimate", the "be-all, end-all" of your computer existence. But we quickly discover that this erroneous belief is a direct result of not knowing what the devilishly clever minds running all of the world's hardware and software companies were going to invent for us to want next week.

In time, we even begin to admit it to ourselves. I'm violating a sacred computer geek trust in telling you this, but when one computer geek is telling another of the latest object of his desire, the conversation goes something like this. The excited beginning: "Pete! Have you seen that new 33 Mhz 68030? Man! I can't wait to get my hands on one of those. Now we're talking power! I can't even imagine going that fast." The jaded response, "Uh huh. This week."

So take heart. Even computer geeks, if they've been geeks for any length of time, don't believe that this is "it". Whatever "it" is, it hasn't been built yet. And when "it" is built, rest assured that it will be so expensive that the pursuit of "it" is likely to occupy your computer geek for years.

## — Rule #3 —

Don't touch the screen. Nothing annoys a computer geek more than having to squint at characters blurred by nasty, sticky, greasy fingerprints. Unless you are cruel and enjoy seeing your computer geek spend endless hours wiping at his monitor with paper towels and glass cleaner, avoid pointing out an area of the screen by laying your hands on it. As a corollary to this, never sneeze in the direction of your computer geek's monitor. That's why computer geeks all wear loose-fitting shirts (to haul over their face and double as "sneeze filters", of course).

## - Rule #4 -

Don't pick up the phone. This rule applies only to those computer geeks who own modems. (Of course, there is still some discussion by the CGOA, Computer Geeks Of America, as to whether or not someone without a modem truly qualifies as a bona fide geek.) If your geek has a modem, though, your phone is not your own. It doesn't

take more than once or twice of having you pick up the phone, only to hear an incredible squealing, scratching noise and equally incredible swearing from the other room, before you start asking "Are you on the phone?" each time you reach for it (even though you don't hear talking). Nothing annoys computer geeks more than SILN (Spouse Induced Line Noise) when they're connected to their favorite BBS. This, by the way, makes a second phone line in your home an excellent gift idea for your computer geek.

## - Rule #5 -

Don't look at the CompuServe or long distance phone bills. The question, "Whom do you know in Bumpkis, Washington? And why did you talk to him for three hours at 2:00 in the morning?" will almost always elicit the answer, "Bumpkis? I don't know anyone in Bumpkis." Showing him the number, however, will usually cause him to sheepishly admit that he was downloading 500K of "anatomically correct graphic images" to demonstrate his new graphic card to all his computer geek buddies.

(This is very dangerous behavior, however. It soon results in your computer geek's wanting to handle all the bills, so that you don't have to see them. This, in turn, results in your finances being committed to the computer - usually, the immediate precursor to financial ruin.)

## - Rule #6 -

If you handle the shopping, stock up on brain food. The diet of a computer geek is a rather specialized item. Without the proper amounts of sugar and caffeine, your computer geek cannot function. My suggestion is at least a twelve-pack of "Mountain Dew" and a case of "Twinkies" . An occasional pizza can be ordered for the protein value, but exercise caution to not allow the larder to run low on the aforementioned staples of your geek's diet. (Undernourished computer geeks have been known to go shopping for themselves. This usually results in their purchasing the entire candy aisle.)

## - Rule #7 -

Don't tell your friends, relatives, and co-workers that you live with a computer geek. First of all, most of them will not understand this. They'll run and look up "geek" in the dictionary and then they'll come back and say things like "Eeeew! Why would you want to live with one of those?" And, potentially much worse, those who do understand will want to come bother your computer geek for help and advice. This in turn allows him to turn all your friends, relatives, and co-workers into computer geeks also. Then you are truly alone.

## - Rule #8 -

Don't call the computer room a "den". Computer geeks don't have dens. If they do, they're not computer geeks. By definition, the amount of computer equipment in a computer geek's "ex den" will increase to the point of requiring water cooling. (I think that builders should all install "computer geek cooling systems" , which allow all of your home's air conditioning in one room. My wife and I are still hassling over the fact that, in order for the computer room to be comfortable, she has to use sled dogs and a parka to move around the living room.)

Temperature notwithstanding, part of surviving with your computer geek is to just write off one room of the house. Humor helps here. My computer room is known as "Silicon Central". Somehow, laughing at it seems to take away some of the sting. Buying silly signs for the door also helps, although visitors will then know you're living with a computer geek, even though you hide your geek and close the door to the computer room when they come over.

## — Rule #9 -

Never expect intelligent conversations while they're in front of their computers. This one still stymies my wife. She can walk into the computer room, see me hard at work zapping aliens or monsters, and expect to be able to carry on a normal conversation. Unless you're able to understand and interpret monosyllabic grunts, the best technique is to pull up a chair next to your computer geek and ask what he's doing. Eventually, the effort of explaining it to you will grow so great that he will stop and ask why you came in here in the first place.

My wife also notes that praying for power outages is acceptable behavior. Pulling the breaker yourself, however, is not. One too many times of this, and your computer geek will run screaming from the house in search of an expensive battery backup.

## - Rule #10 -

Never say silly things like, "It's me or that !#$% &amp;* computer!" We lose more good marriages and relationships this way. It's confidential, and besides, you really don't want to hear the answer.

I hope you find these rules of computer geek care useful. Following them will help you get along with your computer geek, I promise you. After ten years as a computer geek, I can speak with some authority on the subject. After four years as a married computer geek, I can speak about that subject too. And as soon as I bone up on my understanding of obsessive behavior patterns, Ill have the whole matter down pat.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga Central

## Johnny C. Kitchens

It seems that no matter how much you try, things never go as planned. The last meeting for Central of 1992 has to be one of those meetings. We had planned to have a meeting based on digitizing. Due to technical difficulties beyond our control it didn't come about. What we did get was well worth the time to see. INOVAtronies has a new game called Vektor Storm. While the game is new to them, many may find it a bit familiar. Looking all the world like an oldtime classic shoot-'em-up from the past, it features vector style graphics and it has all the fast paced action you could want from this type of game. The game can be installed on your hard drive and it even features a real "quit", allowing you to return to Workbench and continue with other things as needed. Harold Williams gave the presentation and admitted to having trouble getting very far in the game due to increasing difficulty in levels. After his presentation of this new game we gave one away as a door prize giving that person a chance to be one of the first to own this new piece of software.

Be at the next Amiga Central meeting and get DIGITIZED

Next, Harold brought out something for all of us to really get excited about. Having Harold in the club has many advantages for us. As many people may know, Harold is a beta tester for INOVAtronics, and that gives us many chances to see their latest software and hardware long before it becomes available sometimes. In this case we were privileged to see the all-new Directory OPUS 4.0. Many of the things that could be said about the original version can be said even more about this all new version. Configurability is the main word to describe this program, and 4.0 has even more of this. Trying to tell everything new or changed would probably require an extra edition of the newsletter. Hopefully my excitement will tempt you to take a look at the new features. For those that already own a current version, an upgrade will be offered. Prices are not definite, nor are all of the features. Things could be added and removed by the time you read this, and hopefully it will be out by then. The main thing I can say is that you should have been there to see it.

Next month, hopefully we will have the meeting we planned for December. We will have a digitizing setup brought in, and you can come and get yourself digitized. There are anyone's control...so I get a practice in at trying to do this. I enjoyed t allenge of my position in the cli for 1992, and 1993 should be even more so. We have a lot to look forward to in 1993. The excitement of new machines and new products to

go with them, along with the everadvancing technology, means a new wave of excitement like never before. So get ready for a technological ride that won't stop! I hope everyone had a great holiday season and I look forward to seeing you at the next club meeting.
