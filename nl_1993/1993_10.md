## METCOM 93

## it's economical it's door prizes it's free!

it's fun it's educational it's colossal it's stupendous

E veryone is talking about METCOM, but nobody has been able to explain what it is! It sure as heck isn't in Websters dictionary. So here is the official definition of METCOOM.

METCOM (n)

[fr. Am. METroplex COMmodore computer club] The largest MCCC organized Commodore event in the MCCC calendar. A day of education, presentations, dealers and our club areas. A day of family entertainment, flea markets and friends. A chance to win door prizes or to get thirteen months membership for the price of twelve. The opportunity to pick up that library disk that you keep meaning to get a hold of at the last meeting but forgot. The most important part is that METCOM is FREE !!

There now...everyone can now explain to their friends and neighbors exactly what METCOM is and how it can make their day.

This year METCOM is following a similar format to last years, particularly the classes that our Education officer Harold Williams has put together. However, we are arranging the timing a lot better. This year the classes will not start as soon as METCOM opens. Instead, there will be a period from 10:00AM to 10:30AM where the only thing open will be the FLEA MARKET.

The CLASSES that are scheduled are on PageStream, Hard Drive care and feeding, Amiga beginners and Video stuff. Fortunately they are outlined elsewhere in this newsletter. Harold has performed his usual wizadry and managed to cater to all our users' requests and tastes, so sign up for those classes early to ensure your place.

There will also be a series of DEMONSTRATIONS put on by our local dealers in a separate classroom. Admission to these is FREE! It's your chance to see the latest products on the market and to maybe learn a few things as well.

Of course, there are still all the normal features you have come to expect at METCOM. The Flea Market is always a favorite — the place to buy that piece of equipment that you really cannot afford but would like to have anyway. The chance to Sell that game you have played and played. David Owens is the head honcho for the flea market this year, so if you have any questions give him a call. He will be only too pleased to either give help or accept help! Elsewhere in this newsletter is more information on the flea market.

Dealers. As usual our local and not so local dealers will be at this year's METCOM. Metropolitan has signed up for a huge space, with our new dealer, Dataphile close behind. Ansoft and others have also signed up, so look out for those dealer bargains that always can be found.

Club Area. The club as always will have an area set aside for our own use. This year, as last, MCCC memberships will be available at "buy 12 months membership and receive an extra month FREE." The club librarians will have set up both the AMIGA and C64/C128 libraries.

Door Prizes. This year, as usual will feature door prize drawings throughout the day. The odds are much better at METCOM than in the Texas State Lottery and it doesn't cost anything to put your name in the hat.

The Competition. Remember, the MCCC is still receiving entries for our competition, so hurry up with those entries. The judges are waiting on tenterhooks to be totally impressed !!!

Now then, what have I forgotten....? Well, as I am writing this I cannot think of anything specific, so you will have to show up at this year's METCOM and tell me what it is.

Remember METCOM Is Free... On November 6th, from 10am to 5pm, at Arlington Convention Center, near Rangers Stadium. See Y'all There.

## the flea market

M ETCOM is coming up quickly and it's time to start going through all of your software and hardware, looking for those games that don't have the same zip they did when they were new and that hardware that you replaced when you bought that new piece to add to your growing collection of must have Amiga stuff. Well, now is the time to move all that stuff you don't need any more so you will have more money to buy more great NEW computer stuff, so you can sell it next year at the flea market at METCOM so you can buy more stuff... I think you get my drift.

I am in charge of the flea market this year and we are looking forward to a great day at METCOM. The flea market will open when the show opens at 10:00 am. If you have something you need to sell, there will be one representative from each chapter to take your merchandise. You will fill out a form listing the items you want to sell. There are two prices you can put on the form. The first column represents the price you are asking for the majority of the day. At 4:00 PM., if you have put a price in the second column, the item will be sold for that price. This will be the "I don't want to take this home, let someone else have it" price. The representative will give you instructions on how to fill out the form if you have any questions.

Now for the legal stuff. You must be a member of MCCC in order to sell items in the flea market. The cutoff date for turning in items for the flea market is October 30, or the discretion of the collector. Items turned into the flea market must be picked up by the December meeting for your chapter. All items not picked up or arranged to be picked up by that time will be given away as door prizes at the chapter meetings. Five percent of the sales of flea market merchandise (or a dollar, whichever is greater) will go to the club. You can not sell any item or group of items for less than a dollar. You can contact one of the following people about flea market questions or dropoff points for your items.

## the classes

nce again it is time for METCOM classes. MCCC's once a year extravaganza will happen on November 6th at the Arlington Convention Center. Along with all the other activities, we have planned five classes. David Owens will teach an AmigaDOS/Workbench class. This class is designed to introduce basic concepts of using the Amiga. David will demonstrate the use of several utilities that enhance and simplify the Amiga operating system. This class is perfect for the novice user. Harold Williams will teach a Hard Drive Basics class. This class will cover organizing and partitioning a hard drive, backup procedures, optimization, and data recovery. Harold will demonstrate both commercial and freely distributable software for working with a hard drive. Brett Hester will teach two classes, 2D Flying Logos and 3D Flying Logos. Both classes will demonstrate the entire process of generating a flying logo. The 2D class will be designed around DeluxePaint IV (Electronic Arts) and the 3D class will use LightWave (NewTek). These classes are perfect for the beginning animator or Amiga artist. Bill Raecke will teach a class on desktop publishing with PageStream (Soft-Logik). Bill will be demonstrating the techniques he uses for creating the MCCC News. Class topics will include font selection, effective use of clip art, and document creation and design. The PageStream class will consist of two 1 1/2 hour sessions. All other classes are one 1 1/2 hour session. Here is the schedule:

| 10:30 - 12:00   | AmigaDOS/Workbench   |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 10:30 - 12:00   | PageStream (Part 1)  |
| 1:00 - 2:30     | PageStream (Part 2)  |
| 1:00 - 2:30     | 2D Flying Logo       |
| 3:00 - 4:30     | 3D Flying Logo       |
| 3:00 - 4:30     | Hard Disk Basics     |

There is a small fee for each class. The fee for MCCC members is $10 for the PageStream class and $5 for other classes. The fees are doubled for non-members. Preregistered students will receive a disk full of utilities/files related to their class. Pre-registered PageStream students can order a special collection of over 100 PostScript fonts with printed sample sheets for $10. MCCC members can order the PostScript font collection separately for $15. Classes are limited to 16 students each. There is a registration form included in the newsletter. Don't miss this once a year opportunity! Register early to assure your place in the class. If you have questions about a class (or classes) contact Harold Williams at 817-4830537.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

SuperBuper SuperDuper by Sebastiano Vigna has been around for some time now. In case you never heard of it, SuperDuper is a floppy disk copy program. What makes it special is its speed. It can copy a floppy using two drives in less than 100 seconds. That includes verification. And it really flies when making simultaneous copies to multiple floppy drives. It's also possible to copy a floppy image into RAM and then make a bunch of copies really quickly. The FMS device (floppy simulation on the hard-drive) and RAD are also supported. As I said, SuperDuper has been around for some time. This version (3.0) sports an entirely new interface and now supports high density drives. It works only under Workbench 2.0 or greater. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_ 591.

## ReOrg

There's another excellent update on MCCC-A\_593. This one is to ReOrg. ReOrg by Holger Kruse is a tool that you can use on hard drives or floppies to make things run faster. The program eliminates the fragmentation that occurs on any disk over time as files are deleted, added or rewritten. Beyond that, the program is also smart about where files are placed on the disk. For instance, icon files are placed close together so that windows simply fly onto the Workbench. If you've ever wondered why the club Super Disks are so fast, this is it. Starting this month, ReOrg is being used to create the masters for all the club disks. It takes about the same amount of time to ReOrg a disk from FFO: to DFO: as it does to do a diskcopy and the results are astounding.

ReOrg is much faster than I expected. As a test, I decided to ReOrg one of the partitions on my hard drive. I thought this would be a rather lengthy process but, much to my surprise, ReOrg managed to process a 30 meg partition in just 3.5 minutes. Compared to the hour that it took to back the partition up to floppies, that was

As might be obvious by now from my comments, ReOrg can work in single disk mode or in a disk-to-disk mode. A word of caution is in order however. This in no way reflects on ReOrg, but if you are ReOrg'ing a disk in the single disk mode, be sure you have a backup first. If your system were to crash while the operation was in progress — or if you had a power failure - everything would be lost. Better safe than sorry.

## MagicMenus

I guess this is the month for updates. On MCCC-A\_596 is an update to version 1.27 of Martin Korndorfer's Magic Menus. In case you're not familiar with this little utility, it does two things. It provides popup menus and it makes the standard menus look a whole lot better by changing the color mapping and putting borders around them. I use it in my system all the time. This version fixed some compatibility problems I was having with Superbase (only the popup menus used to work).

## MultiPlayer

Also on MCCC-A\_596 is the latest version (1.32) of Multiplayer by Bryan Ford. Multiplayer is the finest, most full featured and most reliable mod and med music player around. Unlike most of the others, I haven't found anything that Multiplayer won't play properly. And it provides all the features anyone could want as well most importantly the ability to play a series of tunes from a script. If you don't currently use it, you need to check it out. If you use it already, be sure to get the update.

## PrintManager

And there's yet another good one on MCCC-A 596. Nicola Salmoria's has been upgraded to version 2.0. PrintManager is the slickest print spool utility I've seen for the Amiga. What's a print spooler? It's a little program that sits in the background waiting for you to print something. When you do, it grabs the output and sends it to disk instead. Then it proceeds to simultaneously print the document or picture or whatever from disk. Since you can write a file much more quickly to a hard drive than you can to the printer, this frees up your software so you can get on with other things.

This upgrade has a major new enhancement. In earlier versions, only output to the PRT: device could be captured. With this version, output to the PAR: device can be captured as well. In practical terms this means that PrintManager can be used with programs like PageStream which use their own custom drivers. The disadvantage is that only output to PAR: OR PRT: can be captured...not both at once. But the program is still a big timesaver and is something you probably ought to add to your system.

## Tracker Music

Enough of updates. Let's talk about brand new stuff. What better place to start than with some new music. The keepers for the month are "Shelley" on MCCC-A 596, "Heaven" and "Baroque\_Oldfield" on MCCC-A\_597.

## Mand2000

I saved the best for last. Last month I wrote about a new Mandelbrot exploration program that I was really impressed with. This month there's a new kid on the

block that has some features that simply knocked my socks off. Mand2000 by Cygnus Software is no faster than Mandelmania — at least not at drawing the initial Mandelbrot set — and it doesn't contain the Lyapunov set - but what it does is provide an unbeatable interface and all the power you could want behind that interface. Let me tell you about just a few of the features.

See a spot that looks interesting? Double click on it and Mand2000 zooms in on it. The program has a unique way of drawing the screen. It starts from the center horizontally and draws up and down from that line. But at first it draws just a rough approximation - every fourth pixel is calculated and multiplied for the display. Then it goes back and does every other pixel. Then it goes back and finishes up. The number of interations is adjustable, but the result is that you get a quick look at what the picture will look like when it is finished. And if you want to zoom in again, just double-click on the spot. You don't have to wait until the drawing is finished.

Is the picture a little off center? You can use the cursor keys to move it from side to side — or you can even click with the left mouse button and drag the picture to the location you want.

Ordinarily you want a Mandelbrot plot to be screen size (and, of course, Mand2000 supports ALL Amiga screen modes at any desired overscan), but sometimes it would be better to use a smaller version of the picture until you get things just the way you want them. Why? 'Cause it's faster! Mand2000 will operate in a re-sizable window if you like. In fact, you can have as many resizable windows open as you like, drawing as many different views of Mandelbrot or Julia sets simultaneously as you can handle.

There are lots of "good spots" built into the program that are simply selectable from a menu. And there are really nice color palettes built in as well. Of course the Mandelbrot information is saved with the pictures so that you can load them in and continue your exploration later — most Mandelbrot program do that - but you can also load pictures saved with other programs and continue in Mand2000.

Power? Mand2000 has the ability to magnify 10 to the power of 300 times. It also has a full ARexx interface, animation capability and even a morphing feature. If you enjoy this kind of thing, you'll want to pick this up for sure. As a matter of fact, you'll want to send off for the full-featured version. I did. Yep, sorry to say some features are disabled here — and there are little "factoid" windows that keep popping up telling you how great it is — but none of this is enough to spoil the fun. Check it out. It's on MCCC-A\_594.

## List Price

As this is a new product, I haven't seen a list price for it...I purchased it for $64 Canadian. [MODERATOR'S NOTE: I believe the list price in the USA is $79.95, with street prices approximately $45-55. Moonlighter offers a special price to owners of AmiBack, their backup program, and a "trade-in" price to owners of other disk tools programs. Contact Moonlighter for details. - Dani

## Special Hardware and Software Requirements 512K RAM required.

Kickstart 1.2 or higher.

In order to perform many operations on a hard drive, a SCSI drive is required, although the IDE drives in the Amiga 4000/4000T, 600, and 1200 will also work.

## Copy Protection: None.

## Machine Used for Testing

- 2MB Chip RAM, 4MB Fast RAM
- Amiga 1200 (KS 39.106, WB 39.29)
- Microbotics MBX 1200 (4MB Fast RAM &amp; 68882 math coprocessor)
- Maxtor 2.5" 120MB hard drive

## About AmiBack Tools

AmiBack Tools has a wide variety of utilities which can deal with most disk problems an Amiga owner will encounter. The product is packaged neatly in a white cardboard container with a full-colour cover.

Inside the package is a neatly printed manual, and one disk containing the Commodore Installer application and a ReadMe file with updates to the manual. Installing the program is easily accomplished by clicking the "Installer" icon and following the prompts. Installation takes approximately 1 minute.

## Program Options

The "REVIVER" option allows you to recover files quickly and easily which have been deleted from a drive, as long as they have not been overwritten nor wiped with the "ANTISEPTIC" option. The REVIVER is easy to use, and VERY fast, even on large drives. Files can be recovered by simply marking them, then clicking the "Revive Data" gadget. The program can identify duplicate files when reviving data, and notify the operator to rename or skip the file.

ANALYST" searches a drive for errors, and allows the operator easily to repair any errors found. Common errors such as "Drive Not Validated," "Key Already Set," and "CheckSum" are easily corrected here. This module operates quite quickly and can be set for "AUTO" or "Ask Repair" modes. The program can also check all information on the drive, or simply check the file headers.

"GENERAL PRACTITIONER" is the optimizing module, which rearranges your drive data more efficiently. Fragmented files are combined into a single unit, free space is combined, and directory access speeds are improved. This operation takes quite a while to complete (20-30 minutes on a 45MB partition); however, it dramatically speeds up file loading times and directory accesses. It is possible to turn on/off any of the optimization options, so you can (for example) tell the program to optimize files/free space/directories only in order to speed up the optimization process.

"911-RECOVERY" allows you to recover files from drives that, due to some problem, are no longer recognized as AmigaDOS devices. This option allows the user to recover files from the damaged device by storing them on floppies or any other accessible AmigaDOS device. This module has two modes of operation. In the "Recovery" mode, the program reads all data blocks from the damaged device, attempts to locate files on the drive, and presents you with a window with a list of the files. Then, you can indicate which files you want to recover. Files can be recovered onto another device, and may also be compressed if you are recovering to floppies. After you recover all of the files, the program is set to the "RESTORE" mode, the files are read back from the drive (only necessary with floppies), and the information can then be written to any valid AmigaDOS device.

LAB TEST" allows the operator to generate and store a "CRC" table for all files on any device. Your files may then be compared to the table entries at a later date to check for corruption due to natural or artificial means (viruses). It is easy to build database modules with this option, although it takes some time even on accelerated machines. After the database has been built, AmiBack Tools can reread the database and compare the files on the drive to the database file.

"ANTISEPTIC" is a security operation which allows the user to overwrite all empty space on the drive or the entire device with random information, so files cannot be recovered by any means. This operation is very fast, and an option is available to provide multiple "passes" to ensure that data is totally erased.

## Configuration Options

AmiBack Tools offers a wide variety of configuration options which allow the operator to set the look and feel of the program, as well as security and caching options. The security option allows the operator to restrict "write" access to the drive, so that a password must be given before any data is modified with the program. The Disk Cache improves optimization times in the "General Practitioner."

## Miscellaneous Features

As of version 1.02, the ARexx port is not installed; however, a note in the README file on the disk promises that a patch will be available in the future to include ARexx commands.

Included with the program is "AmiSched-I!", a very slick scheduling program which can allow you to run both AmiBack Tools and AmiBack (the HD backup program) on a scheduled basis without operator intervention. The interface is nicely done, and the program works well.

## Documentation

Documentation is contained in a 66-page manual, bound on the spine with a plastic (CERLOX) edge.

The documentation is nicely styled, with large arrows to mark important or dangerous operations. The manual also offers a section at the beginning called "In Case of Emergency." The documentation is written for all levels of users, from beginner to expert, although expert readers may find it slightly wordy.

## Likes and Dislikes

Likes: The program's functionality is excellent. The "REVIVER" (undeletes files) is amazingly fast, even on large drives. All of the other modules are easy to use and work well.

Dislikes: The disk optimizer seems rather slow. I still find "ReOrg" [on a Fish Disk] to be a MUCH faster optimizer, although it doesn't work with the new Directory-Cached Filing Systems of AmigaDOS 3.0 (and AmiBack Tools does).

My only other dislike is that the "Save Password"

option saves the password in the config file in "S:". I would much prefer having it write directly into the file to reduce the possibility of tampering. This would also be handy if you install it on an accessible computer at work: if the employees don't know the password, they're less likely to walk away with a copy.

## Comparison to Other Similar Products

AmiBack Tools performs many of the same operations that Quarterback Tools does (i.e., Undeleting files, Optimizing Drives, repairing errors, etc.). AmiBack's slick user interface and compatibility with new filing systems give it much more functionality than Quarterback Tools has. Quarterback Tools has not been updated (to my knowledge) since 1991, and has fallen far behind the other disk maintenance tools. [Editor's Note: Quarterback Tools has been upgraded as of this publication./

The new version of DiskSalv 2 from Dave Haynie is also quite similar to AmiBack Tools, and performs many of the same operations.

Bugs: None found.

## Vendor Support

Excellent! The author has released two freelydistributable patches already, and will likely continue to produce patches to correct bugs and add features as time progresses.

Warranty: None.

## Conclusions

AmiBack Tools is on the cutting edge of disk maintenance utilities. A slick user interface combined with a functional program make this utility a "must" for all Amiga owners.

I have no problems giving AmiBack Tools a 5-star rating (out of a total of 5), both for the program's functionality, and for Moonlighter Software's support for their products.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The September meeting went as planned, which is more than I can say for the newsletter - that was rather lacking the club meeting report. Still, we are back now and reporting as usual. The demon. stration this month was of PhonePak from GVP. A very thorough demo of all its ins and outs was given by Ned. More on this later.

The meeting started at 7:30 pm, with a slew of announcements. METCOM was by far the largest of these. November 6th is the date; Arlington Convention Center (near Rangers Stadium) is the place; 10:00 am to 5:00 pm is the time.

There then followed a question and answer session focused very strongly on Commodore and A4000 in particular. The new motherboard problem encountered if you install an A4091 in the expansion slot. The problem is apparently due to the new Buster chip. Other questions were based on PageStream color postscript printing and the now famous/infamous RDS program.

Now on to the presentation... Ned Kelly was gracious enough to give a very professional demonstration of GVP's PhonePak hardware/software. PhonePak is an integrated phone control system. It encompasses voice mail, fax control, call screening and several other features. Ned explained the facilities with hands-on practice. That is, he had to remember the correct numbers to enter on the phone to show off some of those neat features, particularly call screening. Ned astounded us with his ingenuity of hooking up an X10 system to his AMIGA and then showing how he had managed to get lights to turn on and off remotely when he entered the correct digits. Simply wild... Thanks, Ned for the excellent · demonstration of an amazing piece of equipment for the Amiga.

Now, here it is... What's The Loop Doing Next Month Section? The next Amiga-By-The-Loop presentation is to be given by me!!! WOW! I wonder what I shall do? Oh! yes, I remember something about upgrading Amigas with fatter AGNUS chips and generally giving an overview of the Amiga hardware.

Remember METCOM is coming up. See you there...

Well, that's it for this month. We hope to see you at our next meeting of the Amiga By-The-Loop.

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

In lieu of our usual excellent article from Johnny Kitchens, this month we'll just cut to the chase. Last month's presentation was an excellent look at the Retina graphics board. Jon Brdecka was the presenter — the board was his. And it sure was impressive to see his Workbench 2.0 machine acting like a 3.0 4000...256-color Workbench and all. You should'a been there. Thanks, Jon.

A special thanks goes to Commodore Country for donating two door-prizes for our September meeting. Yours truly won one of them...an action/maze game called Cytron by Psygnosis (and it's a lot of fun too). Ned Kelly was the other

lucky winner.

At our October meeting, ANSOFT Data Systems will be on hand to give us an up close and personal look at the latest paint program for the Amiga, Brilliance. Brilliance, from all reports I have heard so far, knocks Deluxe Paint right out of the lead. I'll be looking forward to getting a first-hand look at it. Be sure to join us.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Our September gathering was the last to be held in the very lovely Richardson Civic Center. Our October meeting will move (as has been discussed the last few meetings) to King of Glory Lutheran Church, on the north side of LBJ between Hillcrest and Preston. If you need more detailed directions, call Brett Hester, (214) 233-5493. For now, the meetings are to be on the 3rd THURSDAY every month. If you have a conflict with that schedule (as I do), contact Danny Barnett. That makes our next meeting on October 21st, 7:30 p.m. We'll have signs and/or people to point the way. The facility, I'm told, is comfortable and well provided with power outlets, and best of all, it's FREE.

Speaking of conflicts, November is traditionally our officernominating month. We hope our librarian William Dockendorf will find a new local job by then, but if not, we'll need someone to step in to fill the position he has so dedicatedly held these past terms. I, too, will need a successor, especially if the meetings remain on 3rd Thursdays. (Life has gotten complicated lately...) If you have ideas for new officers in any position (including yourself!), talk to us at the next meeting!

METCOM note: our chapter's flea-market collector will be Gus Reiter (713-7348). His job will be to gather, inventory, label, etc. any

hardware or software goodies you wish to offer for sale at METCOM. MCCC will get a small percentage of the sales price. If you have fleas to market, please decide on your asking and minimum acceptable prices and give Gus a call to coordinate delivery to him and pickup of any leftovers after the convention.

We met a special guest at the beginning of the meeting: Bruce Rutherford from the newest Amiga store in town, "DataPhile." I'm going to try to catch their Grand Opening tomorrow morning, as they are right around the corner from 'me in Plano, on Parker Road just west of Central (near where Mervyn's used to be and Burlington is now). Bruce brought a Star Micronix SJ144 color thermal printer to show off. Come up and check them out!

News bits: Dave Byrne had news about a UNIX for A3000s available now (source and object), a preliminary version expected to become the "UNIX standard" for the Amiga. Ask him for details if that's up your alley. Tom Brooks' new BBS (AI for either Amiga/IBM or Artificial Intelligence, he still hasn't made up his mind) will now answer up to 14.4K BAUD at 2728476. Give him a call! A new Directory Opus upgrade from 4.0 to

4.1 is available for $10. We heard about a few of its new features. Here's a special offer: Danny Barnett will replace the worn-out microswitches in your Amiga mouse and do some general mousekeeping for

## President of MCCC's Amiga North Dallas Chapter

For those who weren't able to attend our September meeting, I've got an important piece of news: The Amiga North Dallas chapter of MCCC will not be meeting at the Richardson Civic Center in October. Instead, our next meeting will be held at the King Of Glory Lutheran Church in Dallas on Thursday, October 21, starting at 7:30pm.

Naturally, change always brings problems, and this is no exception. Some people simply cannot make it to a Thursday meeting due to prior commitments. Despite its high visibility, some of us may have a little trouble finding King Of Glory the first time. One person expressed a wish to see the choice of location to be put to a vote, even though this has not been done by chapter presidents in the past. In all fairness, this may not be a perfect solution, but at the same time it doesn't have to be a permanent one, either.

This was not an easy decision to make. Richardson Civic Center is a great facility that has been very kind to us in the past, and I really hate to say goodbye to those folks. However, for the past few years, MCCC funds (your membership dues) have gone to help us acquire space at the Civic Center, and if someone is willing to provide space for free, that money could always be used for purposes more productive to the club, such as running METCOM and other activities, keeping our club BBS online, etc. And if you're going to pay membership fees, you want your money to work for you as much as it can. I'm hoping this change will make your dues work a little harder.

If you're able to make it to our October meeting, we'd love to hear any and all suggestions and feedback you might have. We can't benefit you if you don't let us know what your feelings are, and we want to make the transition to a new meeting location as painless as possible. Please be patient with us while we try to smooth out the rough spots.

And now for the directions: King Of Glory Lutheran Church is located at 6411 LBJ Freeway in Dallas, between Hillcrest and Preston. If you have a Dallas MAPSCO, the church is located on Map 15, grid P.

And to those who were interested in seeing the MONOXIDE demo by Vanish at the September meeting, I apologize for not being able to pull it off; I'll make sure you get to see it at the October meeting, and Ill even try to get a couple of others to make up for the delay.

Once again, the meeting will be on Thursday, October 21, at 7:30pm. We are going to make more of an effort to start the meetings on time from now on, so please try to be punctual. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to call either Brett Hester or myself. Our telephone numbers can be found on the inside back page of this newsletter.

Thanks to all of you, and we'll see you on October 21!

just $5.

On to our demo for the evening: "Retina" , a 24-bit video display board. Dave Byrne explained that there are currently four or five "acceptable" 24-bit boards, almost identical in specs and price. He listed "Retina", "Picasso II", "EGS2824" by GVP, and "Picolo" (please 'scuse any speling errers). A fifth, "Merlyn", is apparently not living up to its claims and has "lousy software" , according to Dave. The "Retina" board is about $699 with 4 meg of memory. A 2-meg board will run the same stuff, but 4 megs gives you double buffering for speed. A Workbench emulator runs on the "Retina" board, as well as many applications such as desktop publishing. Sorry, most games will NOT run, as they bypass the operating system calls. Resolution has improved over recent years — the new boards have cleaner images. They run faster than AGA, especially with faster scrolling. With "Retina" you get the board, two disks of software, and the XlPaint package. The prior release (which ran on 1.2) had a very poor manual, translated from German. The new manuals for both board and Paint are much improved. An application for setting up specifications

for different monitors handles most known types, but you can design your own if need be. There's also a screen blanker, a menu function, and a display program. Dave has used PageStream with his "Retina" board, and was very pleased not to have to wait around while the screen was redrawn when scrolling. The makers of TV Paint 2.0 have a version for the "Retina" board that is only $399, much less than their other versions. The most novel thing about TV Paint 2.0 is its scripting ability — it can record and replay your "brush strokes" as you draw. We got to watch a replay of a good artist's efforts taking a picture from a "pencil sketch" to a well-fleshed-out illustration. (There's a pun there, for those of you who saw the finished work.) It was fascinating! I bet a good artist could sell a "how to paint a picture" demo like those PBS art lesson shows using this package. Fascinating, Dave. Thanks!

Door Prizes: Warlock, Matrix Marauders, and an Interchange Forms In Flight Conversion Module (Read "blank disk" if you don't have that software). It was getting to be a very late evening — sorry if I missed anything major. See you at the new location in October - Brett and Danny will have something interesting to show us (but I'm not sure yet what it will be).

## Fort Worth

Brenda Sessums

G'day, mates! All kinds of exciting news and demos were waiting for us at the September meeting. For one, our chapter should be growing even bigger soon with the transfer of the Arlington/Grand Prairie Chapter members to our chapter. We extend a great big Texas welcome to our new members. We had 13 happy Commodore users show up at our September meeting, including one new member! Our president, Jo Lynn, was out on vacation and was very much missed.

Something we should mention here is that while anyone is welcome to our meetings, the focus of demos and tips at the Fort Worth Chapter are primarily given on the C-64 and C-128 computers. We say this primarily so the members of the disolved Amiga West Chapter won't expect demos with Amigas at our meeting. We would love to do it, and several members also have Amigas, but that isn't our charter. Chapters like Amiga By-The-Loop are a lot more helpful for Amiga users. Of course, if anyone has a Plus 4, Vic-20 or 16, or just want to meet some fun and helpful people, come on down!

And now to the demos. John Burk demonstrated an astronomy program on Disks #728 and #729. It graphically shows the major constel. lations, gives you a description of each, and labels the stars. A farm game for the 128 helped you plant your crops. Fast Copy 128 looked real easy to use. Diet 128 helped you count calories and fat. A nifty little program called Purge 128 allowed you to scratch single or multiple files.

A real helpful program called Comma Sense really showed you how important the proper usage of commas is. An example was that a king had sent a message to his military commander who was holding a prisoner. The message read: "Spare him not kill him." As you can see, the fate of the prisoner lies in where the comma is placed! "Spare him, not kill him." \_ the prisoner goes free. "Spare him not, kill him." — the prisoner dies. That program sounds like a must have!

Disk #350 had a 64 program with SID songs. These were sing-alongs and some even had words to make it a little easier. There was also a game from Germany called Pink. This was an animated sliding tile puzzle of the Pink Panther with authentic-sounding theme music, and a cursor that looked like the

Pink Panther himself. Computer Magic was a magic card game where you picked a card and the computer, with nothing up its sleeve, showed you which card you chose. The disk also contained a Listmaker, a DefCon game, and a Needle Graph. The last one helped you to create stitching patterns, save them and get a print out. (Another money maker to help pay for club dues!) John also demonstrated Home-Made, an inventory program for possessions. That one would be handy for personal records and insurance claims. Cops and Robbers was a game where you crack safes. If you get caught, a paddy wagon with a siren sounds, and off to jail you go.

Commodore Country out in Burleson has gotten some new games and joysticks for the 64 and 128 (as well as Amiga). They have become direct distributor for Psygnosis games, discounting them as much as half-price. They will also give club members a discount on other items, and do price matching.

For our new members, and those who have forgotten how to get here, just call one of the Fort Worth Chapter officers listed on the inside back cover of this newsletter for directions to the next meeting at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM). See ya there!

The deadline for the METCOM competition will be coming up soon (October 23). Some of the things you might create are music, digitized pictures, Koala art, games, or helpful programs. Of course, the competition isn't limited to this. Just use your imagination, and any Commodore computer. Have fun with it! One former member of the Amiga West chapter showed us some outstanding arts and crafts he created using the Amiga and a lot of creativity. His work was really great, and he had been selling his work at Scarborough Faire! You can turn in your work at the next meeting on October 9, or mail it to the club P.O. Box.
