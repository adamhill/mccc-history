## a summary of new features by Martin Taileffer

## Why 2.1? downloaded from GEnie

A lot of people have been trying to decide whether 2.1 was worth upgrading to. Here's a message , from Martin Vertex Taileffer, author of TurboText and a Commodore employee, that spells out the advantages.

I've seen many questions in this topic about what 2.1 is and why should anyone buy it. Here is a fairly detailed list of the enhancements:

Localization. The majority of the GUI-based system software can now run in any of 10 languages.

PostScript printing. A PostScript printer driver allows any Amiga application to print to PostScript printers.

CrossDOS. An integrated solution that enables any Amiga application to read and write MS-DOS format disks transparently. This is not merely throwing in the old CrossDOS software in the box. CrossDOs is fully integrated with the rest of the system.

Improved ASL. A new ASL library provides for the fastest file requester on the Amiga. It is now possible to delete files from within the file requester. The font requester now caches the font list for much better performance. There is a new ScreenMode requester that new applications are begining to use. Finally, all requesters are font sensitive, so they appear in the font you chose in preferences.

Improved Outline Fonts. 2.1 provides phase 2 of the Compugraphic Outline fonts (2.04 had phase 1). This offers better printing abilities for DTP software.

Sound preferences. It is now possible to attach any IFF sound or beep to the Intuition Display Beep() function. This means that whenever an application flashes the screen due to an error, it can now be made to make sound instead of, or in addition to, flashing the screen.

Improved Commodities. commodities.library and associated commodity programs consume much less RAM, and have much better performance. This means that using any commodity program has a much smaller impact on total system performance than in 2.04. The Blanker commodity now offers color cycling and spline animation as options. The FKey commodity now offers the ability to bind any of 8 commands to any key sequence that can be entered. Two of these commands are Run Program and Run ARexx Script, which means it is now possible to have any program or ARexx script executed from a hot key.

Improved keymap selection. The keymap used by the system is now picked from within the Input preferences instead of using the arcane SetMap command.

New display modes. A few new monitors are included with 2.1 that offer various ECS display modes including some 72Hz refresh modes, and the very nice 800x600 mode.

New driver scheme. Printer drivers, keymaps, monitors, and mount list entries can now be fully installed and removed by dragging icons from the Workbench.

Format GUI. Format now has a nice GUI when run from the Workbench. It allows easy selection of the disk format to use, such as FFS, or the International Mode file system, whether to do a quick format, the name of the disk, and whether to put a trashcan on the disk.

Clock. Enhanced Clock program supporting localized date formats. When used in analog mode, no longer consumes any chip RAM, whereas before it could suck up to 32K of chip RAM.

More stable than even 2.04. 2.1 includes many bug fixes and miscellaneous enhancements throughout the system. 2.1 and 3.0 are the most stable and reliable versions of the Amiga operating system released to date.

More RAM. Running 2.1 generally gives you more system RAM. The base system consumes less RAM than previous releases, and as you run more system software, you save more and more RAM.

Much better documentation. The documentation that comes with 2.1 has undergone a substantial upgrade from previous releases, and is generally clearer and more detailed.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

Y racker Music The big news this month is music. We have a lot of new scores for all of you music collectors out there...and I count myself among those. In all, there are 34 MOD and MED scores on 9 disks. My favorites among these are Boesen and Get Down from MCCCA \_487; Helix, Night Drizzle and Mockingbird on MCCC-A\_488; Preview II on MCCC-A\_499; TEchnoConcerto on MCCC-A\_500; Crystal Rain on MCCC-A 501; JordanJazz on MCCC-A\_502; and Rubicon on MCCC-A\_503. Of course, your tastes may be different than mine. Give them a listen.

## SetBuffers by Austex Software

But music isn't the only thing new this month. On MCCC-A 492 is one of those "must-have" and "how come

![Image](1993_03_artifacts/image_000005_833d7601fe53b8f4741d851df510bc566a6b3a69afb3cc1aa8de518c7ea59486.png)

nobody did this before" kind of utilities. It's called SetBuffers. It does just what it sounds like it does...it will set the buffer sizes for your disk drives. This is kind of what the Shell command "AddBuffers" does — but this is not a shell command. SetBuffers is an intuition driven utility. What's more, you can set buffer sizes for all your hard drive partitions as well as your floppies. Of course this provides nothing more that you can get by simply going to your hard drive utility, changing the buffer size and then rebooting...except, of course, that you don't have to re-boot. That means that if you are doing a lot of floppy work, you can bump up the buffer size on the fly and then bump it back down again when you are done — and you can do the same thing for hard drives. It means you can get maximum speed when you need it without wasting huge amounts of memory when you don't. It's convenient, it works like a charm, and everyone ought to have it.

## PageStream Updates from SoftLogik

On MCCC-A\_496 you'll find a complete set of "Drivers" for PageStream. These replace your entire "Drivers" drawer. Some of them are updates and some are the same as what you already have...but this is a quick and painless way to make sure you have the latest. On the same disk you'll find four print drivers for PageStream for Hewlett Packard printers. There are new drivers for the HP DeskJet 500C, the HP Desket 550C, the HP LaserJet, and the HP LaserJet IV.

## Fonts

We have a couple of new fonts this month. "Squire" is a Compugraphic font that can be used with PageStream, ProPage or even Workbench. "Ol' 54" is a Postscript font that can be used with PageStream. Both are worth adding to your collection.

Ol 54

## a new po compression scheme by Mike Wagman

ne of the greatest features of the Amiga is its music (among other things) without much involvement from the CPU. XPK puts the CPU back into the process. What is XPK? It is a packer library. How can it be used? As a archiver such as lharc; with a hard drive backup giving 40% + compression (42 and 44 in my case); or mounted over a device so that it will automatically pack/unpack all files on it.

On an unaccelerated Amiga the compression scheme I find most useful is called "nuke". "Nuke" compresses at approximately 10K per second and unpacks at about 55K per second. On an accelerated Amiga it is likely that floppy access is quicker, as the file crunches faster than it saves. Compression in many cases is comparable to lharc. The only bug I have found is that it occasionally gives a false "destination full" error, then goes ahead and saves it anyway.

I have compressed my mods (music) directory on my hard drive and saved about 33%. 3-d objects compress to 50-60%. This has allowed me to recover about 6 megs of my hard drive! My hard drive backup took 8 fewer disks. It will work with HD floppies for almost 2.8 megs to a disk. ABackup is the only HD backup program that works with XPK that I know of.

## MCCC Spring Classes

class info from Harold Williams he Metroplex Commodore Computer Club will offer interest to those wishing to create their own Amiga applications. The first class will be a complete introduction to the ARexx programming language. The class will cover virtually every aspect of ARexx, including the creation of stand-alone applications and the use of ARexx to control applications. ARexx is a part of the AmigaDOS 2.x and 3.x operating systems. It is available from William S. Hawes for AmigaDOS 1.x systems. The second class will feature the use of CanDo. This class will include a complete overview of the CanDo development system and examples of numerous real applications. CanDo is available from INOVAtronics.

Both classes will be held over a period of 4 weeks in three sessions, consisting of a total of nine hours of instruction. The first session will be held April 3rd, the second session April 17, and the third session on May 1. The classes will be held at the Arlington Convention Center, which is conveniently located on I-30 between Dallas and Fort Worth. The ARexx sessions will be held from 9:30 AM to 12:30 PM and the CanDo sessions will be from 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM. If you've always wanted to know how to get your Amiga to do truly amazing things, these classes are just the thing.

Registration is required. Forms were included in last month's newsletter, and forms will be available at all of the Amiga chapter meetings this month. The registration fee is $15 per class or $25 for both classes. Class size is limited, so register early! If you have questions, contact Harold Williams at 817-483-0537./

## Bill's Tomato Game

by John Gonzales from the Seacoast Area Amiga Users Group newsletter

'ey Dan, can you spell TOMATO? Well, I know Hat after playing Bals Tone to Caten ene Psygnosis, I can. In this game you take on the roll of Terry the tomato. Terry and Tracy have escaped the dreaded one way trip to the produce market and after some very nice graphics, animations and music on the opening screens, the tomatoes arrive back at the farm, safe and sound. Then Tracy is tomato-napped by Sammy the squirrel. Your mission is to move through ten worlds, each containing ten levels. The object of each screen is to move Terry from the springboard to a conveyor belt. Now this may sound easy, but in case you didn't notice, tomatoes don't have legs. So, to help you along, you have four tools. You can use fans, springboards, trampolines and blocks. You begin your efforts to bounce Terry around the screen using these tools. The springboard at the beginning of the screen will launch Terry straight up and fans can be placed at different levels to blow him sideways. In fact, if any moving obstacle in the screen touches a tool, it will be removed from the screen. This can be a real drag, literally. You will need to cycle through the toolbox and drag the tool back to where you want it. Now you have to find just the right place to put your trampolines, springboards and blocks. If you place a trampoline too high, you may not get the right amount of rebound and Terry will probably end up as a splat on the floor. If it is too low, he just splats on impact. Then you have to find the proper distance from the launch sight. If you happen to miss, you will see (and hear) poor Terry become homemade ketchup.

Now, the designers didn't want to make it too difficult so they have included a well written manual and it's full of humor. You will also be able to read the directions in four languages, provided you can read four languages. This way there can be no mistakes. But they didn't want it too simple, so they added a timer. Major bummer! This game will give you a password at the completion of each level which allows you to return to the last level you completed when you restart the game. I did find it difficult to shoot poor Terry into the air, knowing that there is a really good chance that he is going to end up as a mark on the floor. And, just to show you how much faith Terry has in you, he looks at you and gives you a big grin and a wink.

I was only able to finish two worlds and that was with help from my ten year old son. The graphics are top notch and the sound track, while it is nice, can be shut off. So if you have the patience of a saint and you enjoy a challenging and addictive game, look no further.

## We're Number 3!

by Jeff Sprague from The Sacramento Amiga Computer Club newsletter miga fanatics fight a constant battle. We rest ·most elegant and exciting home computer on the market, but we constantly face opposition from users of those "other machines". GULPs (Gullible Users of Lesser Platforms) attack on three battle fronts: Power, Software, and Support. I would like to address these issues.

A stock Amiga 500HD/600HD will outperform any MAC 16mhz or IBM 386 in a majority of practical applications and comparisons, and an A3000 will compete with the BEST of them and win. In a race with the new A4000, the Amiga will beat ANY PC or MAC to the finish line and still have time to grab a sandwich. Bill Gates, the president of software giant, Microsoft, reportedly said that it was impossible to create an effective multi-tasking operating system with 1 megabyte of memory, yet a stock A500 with 512K has been effectively multi-tasking for over six years; even while running Microsoft's own BASIC. The 500 can do in one meg what would require 4 megs in an inefficient PC. Power is not an issue, folks, Commodore programmers know what they're doing.

Software. While it's true that almost every major software house has ignored the Amiga, we are not lacking in software by any means. With programs such as Gold Disk's Professional Page/Calc/Draw family, SuperBase IV, Final Copy, SAS C, AMOS, and WordPerfect (ok, it's 4.1), we're set. Add to that list all the various 3D, rendering &amp; graphics programs, audio sampling &amp; editing software, and the whole bevy of audio/video hardware, the Amiga can accomplish just about anything a creative mind can conjure up.

Support. This is just a clever ploy by GULPs to cover up their "lemming-like) devotion to kludgey machines. It's true that Amiga users don't have "six guys at the office" or a next door neighbor who can solve all of their computer problems for them; most bookstores ignore us, and we certainly don't have a computer store on every block. Admittedly, this kind of "support" would be nice, but it certainly isn't necessary. In fact, a beneficial sideeffect is that most Amiga users are a lot more selfsufficient and computer-knowledgeable than the average PC user. We join user groups and take an active role in making the most of our machines. I will concede this one issue of "support" to the GULPS only when they admit Amiga users, as a whole, are much more computerliterate. Then the GULP will have to ask himself, "Would a computer-literate choose an inferior machine? Would an automobile designer buy a Yugo?

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The Loop meeting was brought to order by our President David Owens, who gently chided the 35 members to listen to his brief announcements before getting into the meat of the meeting.

The announcements for this month were centered mainly around the Educational courses mentioned in my report last month and prepared by Harold Williams. These classes are for ARexx and CanDo at the Arlington Convention Center. Everyone should have received notification of these classes in last month's newsletter. David also reminded everyone to look out for their membership expiration, which is a highlighted feature on your newsletter mailing label.

version. As usual, I will not attempt to convey the demonstration, since I do not have the space in this report. Anyway Jim did a fabulous job of presenting the package to all who were present. If you need to see the new version I would suggest you visit a dealer or check out someone in the club that has it. Jim also said that INOVAtronics is offering an upgrade policy for those of us with V3.xx. To upgrade, you can write or call INOVAtronics for more information. Amiga-by-the-Loop would like to extend our thanks to Jim for the excellent presentation on Directory OPUS V4.0.

The Q &amp; A session followed with topics ranging from the availability of Hi-Density floppies at $100 to HP550C printer drivers. At the end of the Q &amp; A session, we all sat back and watched a 15 minute Commodore Video on the use of Amigas in Multi-Media presentations. This tape features businesses that have successfully used Amigas in various ways to highlight either the companies themselves, products or other items like the courtroom graphics. This is a fascinating tape and even includes a voice-over by one of our own, Scott Lamb, who explains how easy it is to use CDTV as an integral part of interactive multimedia training.

The presentation for this month was given by Jim O'Flaherty from INOVAtronics. Jim introduced us to Directory OPUS 4.0. The first topic he explained was that the configuration for the new version has improved over the old!! Well, if you have the old 3.xx version and you thought that was configurable, you will be amazed at the added configurability of the new 4.0

Now, as premiered in last months report... WHAT'S THE LOOP DOING NEXT MONTH SECTION? Next months presentation will be a discussion and demonstration on CDROM stuff. Not just CDTV, but third party CD-ROM stuff as well. So plan to attend our March festivities.

Well, that's it for this month. We hope to see you at our next meeting of the Amiga By-The-Loop.

## Amiga Central Johnny Kitchens

With the February meeting of the Central Chapter came a valuable lesson in chain of command. As neither the President nor VicePresident could attend, I was, you could say, left holding the bag. Getting up before a live audience definitely speeds up my metabolism. Other than that though, the meeting went amazingly well. My humble gratitude goes to Scott Lamb for assuming control of the meeting and providing us with thought provoking insights into the world of Amiga. Scott was one of the priviledged people allowed to attend DevCon and see, hear, and read about the future of the Amiga as it is developing. Unfortunately he could only tell us some of what he knew. Even if that was a small part of his knowledge it gave us plenty to think about and to look forward to. The largest piece of news was about the DSP chip coming from Commodore. DSP stands for Digital Signal Processor, and that means a lot! The chip will be a AT&amp;T 32 bit processor, and its capabilities are enormous. It will give the Amiga the ability to digitize sounds far in excess of anything we've had or have at the moment. Adam Hill, who also attended the DevCon event, explained that the chip could become a V.32 modem. All that is needed is the programming. Image digitizing could reach new heights with this new chip. The SCSI 2 card Commodore promised was shown, but no price or delivery date was announced. In a word, it's fast and the 4000 users' first hardware update should be something to look forward to.

Next Scott showed us a video made by Creotech which showed off the capabilities of CDTV. All I can say is you should have been there. If this could be shown to some CD-I dealers they might reconsider what they are carrying. Next, we saw a video from Commodore highlighting many professional uses for the Amiga. They liked Scott's tape so much that they incorporated parts of it into their tape. The tape was very professional and made me wonder why their advertising lacks some of the techniques used in the video.

I would like to extend two final thanks to some people who helped make the meeting better. Ansoft, who brought all those hard-to-find magazines to the meeting. (It was after the meeting was over that I realized that I forgot to get one that I wanted. All I can say is, please bring them next month.) Jeff Persyn, who brought a 1200 to the meeting for everyone to look at. It takes a lot to pack up your pride and joy and take it somewhere for a bunch of people to look at. It was the first one I've seen and it really is thought provoking to imagine all that power placed into a

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Ahem...long time no write! Well, actually, I wrote, I just didn't get it to you. Back in December, I slept through the December newsletter deadline, which had been moved up because of the holidays. I can't find my notes...maybe Santa borrowed them, because we sure managed to have a lot of fun that month, and , everybody took home presents! We had at least ten Amigas of various types around for playing, and all kinds of games, old and new. Several people brought software and stuff for the flea market, and believe me those fleas were hoppin'. Those last-minute "clearance sales" looked like the after Christmas rush at the local discount shop, and some who brought stuff just didn't want to haul it back home, so there was a "door prize" for nearly everyone there! I could have told you who brought what, and who won which, and what we saw and played with, but like I said, I lost my notes. I'll keep looking, because there were some special things to tell you about, and thanks to be said. Watch this space.

One thing we accomplished in December was the election of chapter officers for 1993: All of us but Henry Ribron were able to return another year. The weird, wacky, and wonderful Danny Barnett will be our Fearless Leader this year, with Brett Hester returning as President in charge of Vice, Me as your Secretary, William Dockendorf as Librarian, and Gus Reiter as Treasurer. Danny

January rumors/news bits: there's an A4000 Power Up Program in the works; Fred Fish may be closing shop due to lack of subscriptions (so much new stuff that it's too expensive for plain folks to keep up?); the Project D disk cataloger/copier by Ben Fuller may be updated by the author since many people are using it and it's been a while; two new magazines are out, sez Forrest McKinney: Desktop Video World ("about 1/3 Amiga") and Amiga Info; there's a new Playmation (3D modeling and animation) upgrade coming for the Amiga; there's a new AmigaVision Professional coming out with AGA chip support; there's a fine ("giftware") VT terminal emulator for 2.0 and 2.1 out now, called Term version 2.5; and John Chang sez there's a high-density floppy drive now available for around $100 for your 3000 machine (or on A2000 as DFO: only) - ask for details at Metropolitan.

For our January presentation, we welcomed back the very enthusiastic and knowledgable Jim O'Flaherty of INOVAtronics, with the latest Directory Opus to show us. He began by asking how many of us know "what Directory Opus are?" We gently corrected his grammar, but he said it's now so big it's an "are"! He showed us the pretty new box, and "Vanna Hester" displayed the flashy manual. Jim is a great guy, and he has a great product, but talksveryfast and hasagreatdealmoretosaythanIcankee pupwith. I'll try to summarize my five pages of notes on the wondrous Opus, and forgive me if I get anything muddled. At first glance, Directory Opus is a where-is-it, whatis it file manipulating disk directory tool, like the fine product SID. As a matter of fact, Jim said they looked at all the nice things that SID did that the old Opus didn't, and put 'em in. Then they started the fancy stuff, the kind of features you aren't surprised to see coming from the makers of CanDo. We saw a split screen, with Workbench on top and the Opus windows below...grab an icon from above and drag it onto the Opus screen and Opus will, well, DO it. Whatever it is. Like if it's a disk icon, drop it into the directory display box and voila!, there's the disk's contents. (I loved the directory tree option, by the way.) You can custom design multiple banks of buttons, and each button can be tied to a list of commands. Picture a button called "backup" (decorate it with your favorite colors, fonts, etc.), which is tied to the set of commands you would execute to copy your favorite stuff to safety. Click it, and it does it, from within Opus. And if you happened to be looking at a disk you updated, the screen data will change if the directory changes while Opus is watching. And you can decide what you want to see about the files: custom select file type, size, dates, etc. and sort by whatever appeals to you for display. Opus can play assorted music formats, display AGA video, recognize various archive types, etc., etc. For those of us totally lost, there's a contextsensitive HELP function. Every once in a while, Jim would stop to breathe, and ask "You follow?" and quite a few guys out there would be enthusiastically nodding their heads and going "Yeah, yeah!!!" I take that as a positive review, even though I got a bit dizzy with all the technicalities. If you have an older version of Opus, upgrades are $40 (plus $5 S&amp;H) for 3.40 or 3.41, or $50 for an older version. You get the whole ($100 retail) package, with the new 275 page manual, too. Did you get a new registration card assigning serial numbers to your older product?

## CHAPTER NEWS

Be sure to send those cards in and keep up with the serial numbers. Things you have set up under level 3.41 will still look the same...you can activate the new features as you need them. Now I'LL pause for breath and mention that the author of Directory Opus, Jonathan Potter, was visiting from Australia and sat quietly incognito through all the fireworks. I hope he was pleased by the excitement his product created! We also got a peek at the GigaMem virtual memory system (needs an 020 ,030, or 040 with an MMU). They ran it at a show using a BIG hard disk, and the workbench line read "Available Memory 700 meg...". Now THAT ought to hold a few good-sized programs!

Tiger Road (combined with a CDTV keyring from Forrest McKinney) won by Ned Kelly, a second copy of Tiger Road for Bob Harris, Quadralien for Gus Reiter, and Nitro for Todd Murray. Danny Barnett gave us a copy of Aztec C (3.6A), which went to Steve Nichols.

Then came the February meeting...and for the first time (I think!) I managed to completely leave MCCC off my calendar and I missed the show. Apologies, all. I DEPINITELY have it on the schedule for March! Reliable Sources tell me there was a good crowd (55 people) in attendance, and there was the usual lively idea swap going on. Everyone is anxious to see Babylon 5 (forget the plot...get on with the numbers...in case you have an Amiga with a lucky chip set. And there were rumors of yet more Amiga machines to come: perhaps Commodore will eventually run out of numbers, but there are still frontiers to explore and even fancier graphics to invent.

I'm really aggravated that I missed Henry Ribron's PageStream presentation...I'd been looking forward to it! I'm told he passed out a nifty two-page leaflet to all, containing general how-to info, font samples, clip art, etc. Then he proceeded to give a tutorial on exactly how he created the leaflet! A lot of interest was generated on how to use "tags"... you can "tag" a part of your document as a heading, main body, footnote, etc., then design custom canned formats for that type of text. Then if you want to change the font on all the body areas in the whole document, you change the tag and all the text rearranges itself in those areas that are that type of thing, without affecting unrelated parts of the document.

sophistication and greatly enhanced their usefulness. Other features also make this program a handy tool for just about everyone to have when they power up.

President Danny B. forgot to bring the Door Prizes that Metropolitan had to offer, but we'll forgive him if he'll bring us all pizza next month. (Just kidding, Danny!) Fortunately, our own Commodore Product Demonstrator (Henry) brought us a "4000 Reasons" T-shirt, a Commodore water bottle, and some A4000 buttons; and Treasurer Gus Reiter brought his own treasure, including Red Storm Rising, Germ Crazy, and others. Thanks for sharing, guys!

There: three months worth in one swell fopp. Whew! See you in March!

Our cozy little group had another interesting meeting in February. The subject of the program was a mini-review of a shareware C128 utility program called The Servant version 4.84, and a demonstration of the process of "burning" this program onto an EPROM. I obtained The Servant off of the GEnie network a few months ago and found it worthwhile to have it permanently embedded into my C128 system via the empty internal ROM socket. It is written by a very creative fellow from Norway named A. H. Jonassen. The program is a collection of useful disk tools such as disk &amp; file copiers, a directory editor, a directory printer, a file scratcher &amp; unscratcher, a disk formatter, an autoboot sector maker &amp; editor, etc. Most of these operations can be found within various other utility programs, but Mr. Jonassen has given them a little more

The Servant was created to be placed on an EPROM and is capable of occupying at least three different ROM locations. The program comes with mass quantities of text information for creating the EPROM and using the program. Despite the author's language difference, the text files are very good and helpful to beginners as well as to advanced users. There isn't room in this report to go into any more detail about all the terrific things that this program does, but I believe that if you get hold of The Servant on disk you too will want to have it sitting there on a chip in your system. The author asks for $10 US currency to register your use of his program from an EPROM. He will copy his program onto an EPROM for you for $5 plus $4 postage but you must send him the EPROM to be used.

For the other part of the presentation, I used a Promenade Model C1 EPROM programmer and PROMOS 2.0 software from JasonRanheim Company to copy a

customized version of The Servant onto a 27C256L-12 EPROM (32K), just like the one I'm now using in my C128 machine. It's a little tricky working with the EPROM burner if you don't do it very often, so I came prepared with a step-by-step recipe so I wouldn't mess up too badly. The hardware and software worked like they were supposed to, and the result was hopefully successful. Big, big thanks to Glen Herring for letting me use his EPROM burning equipment.

Our main officers were unable to attend the February meeting, so we weren't able to announce the topic for the March chapter meeting. It's bound to be another one you won't want to miss. See you there.

We had a nice turn-out of 16 at our February 14th meeting, and demos of seven really great disks loaded with programs.

For the Commodore 128, there were several programs on Disk #753 that were a lot of fun: USA Quiz, a copy program, a sequential file reader, and Sidplayer 17.50 (which lets you play 12 hours of music!). There was also Pen Pal, an address program and label maker on Disk #123. Disk #733 delighted everyone with Valentine and birthday songs and an animated graphic display.

For the Commodore 64, there was a Tax program on Disk #92, bringing us inline with this popular Yuppie necessity. Stephen Burt showed us a commercial program called Levitian, a great arcade-style space game. Two other fun games we were treated to were Bottleneck and Planet.

A possible money maker (depending on how you play your cards - pun intended) was on Disk #348: Tarot Card Reader. It was a lot of fun. Maybe you could run this program with a 900 number?
