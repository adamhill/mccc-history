## The Real World

the grass isn't always greener by Todd J. Petit, NOCK

"Well, go out and get one," she urged. "How much

Time for culture shock, part two. "I can get one for $100 but that, uh, won't make this program sound any better. It doesn't support a sound card." That took another several minutes to explain.

"T there's something wrong with this computer." I looked up from the latest issue of do they cost?" AmigaWorld with surprise. My wife's new IBM-compatible PC was only a few days old - something was broken already?

"Well, just listen to it," she said. She was running a program called Math Talk, an educational program that promised (among other things) to use speech in its lessons. She answered the math problem on the screen and then, through its teeny-weeny, IBM-style onboard speaker, the computer produced a scratchy, tinny version of "Good job!" My wife looked up at me expectantly.

"What's wrong with it?" I asked, visions of the trouble involved in returning it to the dealer darting chaotically through my mind. As I recalled, the monitor was darned heavy.

"Yeah, so?" I responded, a little slow to catch on. That had sounded about right for an IBM machine. Better than average maybe.

"You can barely hear it!" she exclaimed. "And it sounds terrible!"

Suddenly, the clouds parted - I'd forgotten that my wife had never heard an IBM try to talk before! She was used to the Amiga, a machine with stereo sound and programs with true voice-quality digitized speech. It was culture shock, plain and simple.

She was incredulous. "Are you serious? That's pathetic! How can they sell it like that?"

"All IBM's sound that way," I explained.

How indeed? I wondered how many other first-time PC users out there were having similar reactions upon finding out that their brand new $1500 computer sounded more like the hand-held Pong game in their closet than the Seta console in their living room. Knowing how bad PC sound is, it had always been my intention to get a sound card for the IBM. My wife didn't understand that when I mentioned it before the purchase of the computer itself, but she did now.

It wasn't my wife's fault that she was confused. She's a very bright lady with an Associate's degree in Computer Science who runs our Amiga like a champ. She knows what computers can and cannot do. I believe it was her experience with the Amiga (and our first computer, an Atari 800) that led to her being taken aback by the IBM's poor sound capabilities. Both the Amiga and the Atari have great sound, and we had gotten that Atari nearly 10 years ago!

But Macs and Amigas are kindred spirits, both GUIbased, Motorola-powered machines with as much in common as there is in difference. Comparing Amigas to PC's however... well, that's a whole different story. Here are just a few things I've noticed:

A little time with the "industry leader" will go a long way towards making you appreciate what you have in an Amiga. I deal with PC's MacIntoshes, an IBM mainframe, and (of course) my Amiga on a daily basis. I believe that I have a fair idea of what each machine is like — and my humble Amiga compares darn well to the competition. For instance, my stock A500 runs circles around the 68020-powered Mac that I use for word processing at my office. Mac screen updates are slow, and the thing is incredibly disk-bound.

- People complain about CHIP RAM on the Amiga. At Memory Blocks, and video RAM on a PC and your scheme will die a quick death. Nothing above 640K on a PC is auto-configured and there are whole books on

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke nother eighteen MCCC disks this month. Seems

## Workbench Backgrounds

Might as well start out here. I've been busy again...preparing more backgrounds for my Workbench. As usual, these are 640 x 400, 16-color pics. Most are artwork by Patrick Nagel but there are a couple of scenic shots as well. I actually have a lot more Nagel pics installed on my system than I put on the club disks, so if anyone is interested in more let me know. In the meantime, you'll find this sampler on MCCC-A\_558.

## StatRam by Richard Waspe and Nicola Salmoria

Years ago many of us were using VDO: as the recoverable RAM disk of choice. Then Commodore came out with the RAD: device and many of us stopped using VDO:. For those who may be unfamiliar with the concept of a recoverable RAM device, it is a disk device in RAM much like the RAM: device — except that after a crash or a reboot for other reasons, the contents of the device will still be there. Under the best of circumstances, it should survive anything but a power outage.

Commodore's RAD: device was an improvement over the older VDO: in a couple of ways: it was able to utilize the much faster Fast File System, it could be set up as an image of a floppy disk, and it was a part of AmigaDOS... not an add-on. But it had a couple of disadvantages as well. With RAD: you have to allocate a specified section of memory which is then unusable by anything else in your system whether there is anything actually in RAD: or not. And RAD: looses its contents on a system crash much more often than VDO: ever did.

All this is just background. The new device is called StatRam and it builds a device which, by default, is called SDO:. The device can be called something else if you prefer. What SDO: does is combine the best of the RAD: and VDO: worlds. With SDO: you can choose your file system. The Old File System is still OK, but you can use the Fast File System or the International File System, or even the 3.0 only Directory Cache File System if you like. You can set the disk size to be any size you like (within the memory limits of your Amiga), but the device will only actually use what it needs to hold its contents. To regain SDO: memory, all you need do delete some of the contents...and unlike VDO:, the memory is made available to the system immediately. To put icing on the cake, SDO: seems to be just as stable as VDO: was. I haven't lost anything 1 put in it yet. The only disadvantage as compared to using RAD: is that SDO: cannot be formatted to look like a floppy. But if what you need is a floppy lookalike you ought to be using FFO: on your hard-drive anyway. No need taking up memory for that! Naturally, SDO: is for AmigaOS 2.0 and greater only. Look for it on MCCC-A\_564.

## Tracker Music

As usual, there's a new selection of music again this month. In all, you'll find eighteen tunes on four disks. My favorites for the month are Alpha and Omega, Coloris, Empty Spaces, Empty Spaces 2, and Koyaanisqatsi on MCCC-A\_ 559; Bloodonther, Daisy Chain 2, and Darkness and Light on MCCC-A\_560; Eye, Street Jungle, and Theme-Dream on MCCC-A\_561; and The Wall Part 2 on MCCC-A\_512.

## OctaMED2 by Teijo Kinnunen

But what if you want to compose music... not just listen to it? Well, there are two solutions this month. The first of these is ProTracker 03.10 on MCCC-A\_564. The second is OctaMED2 on MCCC-A \_567. By far, my favorite is OctaMED2. This was a commercial product that has now been released for general distribution because it has been obsoleted by a newer OctaMED. But this one is still very useful. With it you can compose to your heart's content. It will handle the normal Amiga 4-channel sound and will even push your computer to 8-channel sound with some loss of sound quality. There is full MIDI support, and the musical notation can be displayed in either standard notation or the scrolling notation normally seen in "Tracker" music programs. You can build synthetic instruments or import and manipulate sampled sounds. Lots of features. Why do I like it better than ProTracker? Two reasons: it displays properly in NTSC video and it comes with full documentation ready to be printed out. If you have an interest in composing on the Amiga, here's a great place to start.

## Postscript Fonts

What would a month be without some more Postscript fonts for me to fill up my hard drives with. There are some nice ones this month. Look for Davy's Dingbats on MCCC-A\_570; and Averoigne, Hermetic, Jurassic Phartk, MiniPics, Stymie, and Theodoric on MCCC-A\_571.

## ARoach by Stephan Winterstein

In the mood for something totally useless and disgusting? Well, here's just the thing for you. ARoach is a little game/graphic hack that sets a bunch of roaches scurrying around on your Workbench. Just what you needed, right? They like to hide under windows. When you move the window, they go running around looking for a new place to hide. The game part comes in if you enable

the SQUISH mode. If you turn this on, you can squish them with your mouse pointer. If you run it and don't see anything, it's because they've all hidden under your Workbench window. Resize that window and watch them run for cover. Like I said, totally useless. But actually, I have a cat that's fascinated with it. She tries to catch them herself. It's even better than chasing the mouse pointer around! It's a wonder I ever get anything done. Look for ARoach on MCCC-A 562.

## IguanaLoan by Richard MeGowen

IguanaLoan is a simple program to do loan calculations. Nothing fancy here. It won't do an amortization chart, but what it will do is give you a quick way to calculate the payments for a loan given an amount, a duration and an interest rate — or it will calculate the Amount of the loan or the Duration or the Interest Rate given the other variables. What makes it worth mentioning is that it is so quick and easy to use, and that it has a good-looking 2.0 style interface that adjusts properly to the size of the font you are using (something that all the others seem to ignore). It's on MCCC-A\_564.

## Kastle Kumquat by Daniel Leyden

Kastle Kumquat is another of the gotta-have-it games. This one is an action/maze game. Your goal is to negotiate a number of mazes, collecting pulsing blue globes that you will find there. You need to collect them all. There's not a lot of speed required... the hazards are, for the most part, predictable. The skill is in finding your way through the maze to begin with and it being coordinated enough to execute some of the moves that are required of you. Just because the hazards are predictable doesn't mean that they're easy to get through. I've had a lot of fun with this one, even though I don't think I've gotten very far. I've managed to solve several of the mazes but I have the feeling that this is a big game. I have only one complaint — each time I get killed the game restarts at the beginning. This gets tedious after a while. It needs a game save feature. Nonetheless, this is still a keeper. PAL mode is required. It's on MCCC-A - 564.

## Targis by David Ashley

Here's another nice one. Targis is another action/maze game. This one is a little heavier on the action. Remember the game Lode Runner? Well, Targis is a lot like Lode Runner. You are set loose on a screen where your task is to collect all the objects you find there. Of course there are "bad guys" who can kill with their touch. Your only weapon is the ability to dig pits to drop through or to catch bad guys in. When you collect all the objects on a screen, an escape route will appear for you to make your getaway. Targis was a commercial product for quite some time, but now it has been released as shareware. You'll find this one on MCCC-A\_566.

## RDS by Ben Charles Sutter

RDS is short for Random Dot Stereogram. A random dot stereogram is a picture that is produced in a certain way so that, if you look at it correctly, will appear to be three-dimensional. RDS will take any picture and perform the necessary magic on it. After that it's up to you to see to the 3D image it generates. A word of caution...although pictures can be made to appear three dimensional, that's not to say that the 3D image will make any sense. What the program will do is to make the lower color registers appear to be farther away. On a 16-color screen, the colors are numbered 0 to 15. Color number O will be the farthest away and color number 15 will be the closest. This has nothing whatever to do with the actual

![Image](1993_08_artifacts/image_000003_f9d13f5fd13e48afa0f90a5ed61b347cd41b034a86491920a53bb913ea8f62ef.png)

color that is being displayed, so it's not difficult to generate a picture where objects are all disconnected. But it's an interesting program nonetheless.

What you need to do to see the picture is to focus your eyes on a point twice as far away as the actual picture. Give it a little time and it will come into view. I have spent the last couple of years trying to see these images and have been unsuccessful until today. I brought a RDS image up on my computer monitor, held a flashlight next to my head, and focused on that for about 5 minutes. Success! If you have problems seeing the accompanying picture, bring one up on your computer monitor and give that a try. You'll find RDS on MCCC-A\_566. -

the subject of getting it configured correctly. Also, what's best for DOS is not necessarily what's best for Windows — but you're running them on the same system!

- While we're on memory, those claims that you need a minimum of 4MB to run Windows are true. If you want it to run in a fashion so that it compares favorable with Workbench, you'd better make that 8MB and have at least a 40Mhz 386 machine. Windows doesn't have the power or the ease of use of Workbench (it just has better marketing.)
- Commodore can be criticized for many things, but not for pushing the IFF standard. There's a whole cottage industry in the PC world built around converting files from one format to another. Got a picture on the Amiga? You can be sure it's IFF. On an IBM it could be PCX, TIF, GIF, or a dozen other formats. The same goes for sound formats, music, text, etc. It can drive you crazy.
- PC's are voracious in their appetite for hard disk space. This is a computer where games can take several megs of storage each, a word processor can weigh in at over 10MB, and a C compiler can eat up 35MB of disk space!
- A bigger name doesn't necessarily mean better software. I would put PageStream and Directory Opus up against anything in the IBM world. True, there are some areas where the Amiga doesn't have the powerhouse software that IBMs do, but this usually affects the professional Amiga user more than the home user.

No one can argue that the Amiga will ever enjoy the huge acceptance that IBM compatibles enjoy. The Amiga owner (and particularly AGA-equipped machine owners) can rest assured, however, that they own a machine that can be just as powerful as any other manufacturer's machines, but which, in addition, is also a great deal friendlier. The situation reminds me of the Beta/VHS format wars of video cassette recorders. Beta is technically superior but, due to marketing, VHS emerged as the industry standard. The Amiga, in many ways, can be thought of as the Beta tape standard of the computer industry.

"Why do we need separate speakers? Our Amiga monitor has speakers."

"Well..."

The June 5, 1993 meeting of the Board of Directors was called to order by President Owens at 10:20 a.m. Vice President Pete Goad reported on the annual picnic that was not well attended but fun was had by those present. There was a discussion about MetCom, to be held at Arlington Convention Center Nov 6, 1993 and a meeting to be held June 22 at 7:30 p.m. at Pete's house to assign jobs. The BBS committee reported that a new A3000T has been purchased and installed and the A2000 that was operating the board is now for sale. It will be sold to the first reasonable offer. The first asking price has been set at $750. The computer has a 68020 card and other goodies. The next Board of Directors' Meeting will be Thursday, July 1 at 7:30 p.m.

A motion was made by Bill Raecke and seconded by John Malmstrom to dissolve the Arlington/Grand Prairie Chapter for being in violation of the constitution: insufficient officers (2) and insufficient membership (6). As per constitution rules, the motion was tabled until the next meeting.

A motion to adjourn was made by Moss and Kelly. Carried.

The July 1, 1993 Board of Directors' meeting was called to order at 7:15 p.m. by President David Owens. Pete Goad reported that there would not be a large presentation room at MetCom. There was a discussion about the fact that someone needs to be in charge of the Flea Market at MetCom.

Old business: Remove from table the motion to dissolve the Arlington/Grand Prairie Chapter. No objection from floor on motion by Raecke. The motion carried unanimously and members were transferred to the Ft Worth Chapter.

A motion to adjourn was made by Kelly, seconded by Moss at 8:00 p.m. with the next regular meeting to be held on August 5 at 7:15 p.m. J

New business: A motion was made by Eddie Monjay and seconded by Moss that the Amiga West Chapter be dissolved for lack of interest from the membership as officers were the only ones in attendance. The motion carried and members were assigned by zip code to the 3 other Amiga Chapters.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The July meeting was a huge success, despite the All-Star game on TV. The demonstration this month was an example of "Amiga in action" given to us by Scott Lamb, but more on this later.

David started the meeting, then stopped the meeting, then started it again and this time actually continued it! The reason he did that was known only to him, but it is possible that several members were already trying to view the RDS (Random Dot Stereo) pictures that Harold had brought with him.

The meeting started, as I said before, with David welcoming those members who showed up from the now demised Amiga West chapter, and we all extend a big welcome to them and also to our new members. The information section then began, with information regarding the upcoming MetCom competition (see elsewhere in the newsletter). Then David quickly Demo'd the RDS output and also the new ViewTek V1.05. The Q &amp; A session centered around modem problems related to high speed transmissions and the other type of PC.

Now on to the demo. Scott Lamb brought along a slightly enhanced CDTV (it had a DCTV neatly fitted in the video slot! to show a "proof of concept CD" based around geographical information for Education. This was a program that was to enable Elementary school children to find their way around the world, at the same time learning different geographical properties of the region/country of interest. Scott admitted that they had only partially completed the CD for the proof of concept and showed off the Swiss part, as that was the part the programming team finished. As usual, it is really tough to explain the pictorial, video and audio portions of the presentation, so next time you see Scott you might want to ask him about this CD. The Loop chapter would like to thank Scott very much for a very in depth and educational look at the Amiga in action. Thanks Scott.

Now, as premiered in last months report...

## WHAT'S THE LOOP DOING NEXT MONTH SECTION?

The next Amiga-By-The-Loop presentation is going to be Brett Hester demonstrating Scanning techniques. I was reliably informed that the President and VicePresident would almost guarantee this. Unfortunately I will not be able to make it to the next meeting so David will substitute for me. However I will be at the September meeting. Remember MetCom is coming up so get those thinking caps on for the competition!

Well, that's it for this month. We hope to see you at our next meeting of the Amiga By-The-Loop.

## Amiga Central Johnny Kitchens

The July meeting offered our chapter something it gets occasionally. An early meeting and problems. Strangely enough, the two went hand in hand. Our meeting, which occurs on the third Thursday, gets its earliest shot at the month when the first day of the month occurs on Thursday. So the thought that the third Thursday can be the next day after a second Wednesday can throw things off, as it did here. A quick call reminded our presenter of the date, and the meeting proceeded as usual.

We started off with the announcement, or a reminder of the upcoming METCOM event, and the newly planned contest. Full details of the contest will be forthcoming, but it will add a new dimension to the annual event.

Our question, answer, and rumor part of the meeting led off with a story of how someone had shown some IBM users his ordinary everyday Amiga, and having them comment on how impressive it is. Amiga users must remember that not all IBM users are using the latest stuff. So even the most plain Amiga looks far superior to their setup. A question on the Power-Up program on the 4000 was asked. Apparently still in force, but is it a good deal? Where's the 4091 was next. Still under wraps apparently. A question on whether a fast IDE drive could be installed in an Amiga or not was asked. Get an AGA machine was one answer. Strangely enough there are several IDE controllers available. The rumor on the CD-32 was discussed. Apparently a 1200 with a CD-ROM drive in it is being prepared. This could be the rumored CDTV II or it could be the game machine long rumored to be coming. A question on an easy way to change greyscale to color was requested. A few suggestions were made, but none were easy. An easy way to switch to PAL mode was requested.

Hmmm, maybe I should add request to the name of this part of the meeting. There was a question on how to get Lemmings Il running on a hard drive. Apparently a patch is needed for some controllers. Having been inspired by a previous request, someone asked how to get PAL on the 4000. It's simple on the 4000 — or maybe I should say 3.0. Hold both mouse buttons down and select it on the screen that comes up. Now if Commodore will offer this to all the other Amiga models. When will the Toaster update be available? Apparently it is ready now. A question on how well does the Retina work came up. Fortunately we had a new member there who had one. His description of its operation brought quite a few wows out, maybe we can get him to demo it for us. Welcome

## CHAPTER NEWS

to the club, Jon Brdecka. Our last question was on whether or not GVP was still supporting the Amiga. Some recent ads have people wondering. I'm sure that the change that the AGA machines have brought out and the change in the Amiga market has things in a mess for them. Once they get things straighten out, they'll be giving us the stuff of dreams again.

With our previously mentioned mix up on dates, our presenter was a little unprepared [Editor's note: A LOT unprepared] for the intended show, so an alternate route was taken. A recent art form has been sweeping the malls, stores, and shops everywhere. It's called Random Dot Stereography. No sooner does it show up than a piece of software for the Amiga comes up that can create them on the Amiga. These pictures have a problem that they share with certain forms of art work. You either see it or you don't - plus you can look at them and still not see them. It requires the right way to look at them, but once you see it, you are hooked and want to see more. We had printed images on hand which more than a few people just stared at. Harold Williams used an art program to draw up three simple objects on the screen and then convert them with RDS. It was a fast and simple procedure...then we had an image on the monitor. People found this image a little easier to see and several new converts to the world of RDS were inducted. They are addictive! While people were studying the images,

plenty of opportunities to see the Amiga do its thing. Our local friends, INOVAtronics, say their new OPUS is out, with many fixes and some new features - around $10 to upgrade. Also new is the latest CanDo - it now uses standard file requesters and has many new features, and is said to be easier to use. (Look forward to a CanDo update presentation in the near future, perhaps at the August meeting!) Rumor: the CDTV has been cancelled, but may be resurrected in a new model in the future. Did anyone see the recent Time magazine, all about the future? It was chock full of IBM ads, but in a picture of Arthur C. Clarke, taken at his home in Sri Lanka, he sits before his A3000 with an "Amiga Power" sticker in full view. Ha! Proposal from Danny B.: let's get Ross Perot to take over Commodore and see what happens. Hmm. A word from the Art SIG that meets on Sundays in Plano: their August meeting will be a how-to-put-your-anims-to-tape several meetings in the future. How to start a Virus Checker from the Startup-Sequence came up. With Commodore not wanting the StartupSequence fooled with this could open the door for a few early starting viruses. Finally a demonstration of the latest must-have PD software was given. All I can say is if you haven't picked up DiskSalv 2.0, do it now. You'll be better prepared for that disaster you hope you never have to face in the future.

Our July meeting was indeed the "Capture Your World" workshop as promised in June. The meeting was long, but my notes will be shorter than usual, as most of our time was spent digitizing things! We did have a little bit of news, though. A report on the recently concluded Image World show indicated that all

we returned to a mini question session. Terminus 2.0 was discussed. This long-awaited replacement to JR-Comm finally made its debut, and it should generate questions for our local dealers went, and Amigas were much in evidence showing off Toasters, SCALA, etc. NewTek didn't make it, we were told, but people in the video industry had

lesson, and the 2nd Sunday in September all are welcome to come show off videos you have done. Speaking of showing off videos, somebuddy PLEEZ do something neat to show off at the Dallas Video Festival coming up in November! The deadline for submitting entries is 8/2.

News about us: the Amiga North Dallas chapter's officers are considering moving the meeting location. Under consideration is the King of Glory Lutheran Church in the Preston/LBJ area. They have a nice large facility with lots of electrical outlets, and best of all, it's FREE! (Our meeting rooms at the Richardson Civic Center are very nice, but very expensive.) We'd have to move the

## CHAPTER NEWS

regular time to 3rd Tuesdays. Any comments? Any other suggestions? Danny Barnett, our president, is open to your ideas. Here's a little tidbyte: there's a program on the BBS called RDS to make 3D Cyberoptic Stereograms. Sounds very neat. Check it out on the BBS for more information. Brett Hester sez there's a company looking for people with Toaster/Art Department/Lightwave/DPaint experience. If that's you, see him. If you HAVE a job and want to spend a little hard-earned cash, Ned Kelly's A2000 is down to just $500 - any takers? Rumor from Usenet: September 1st will be International Amiga T-Shirt Day — wear your shirt proudly! We had a few questions from the multitude at the meeting, about SCSI tape drives, XWindows simulators, etc. Things got a bit technical, and I tend to just sit there and blink when the tech types get going. When those alphabets start flying, I just sit back and watch...I get lost when the rest of the words are missing, if YKWIM. We did the doorprizes early, so those who didn't want to get digitized could depart. Metropolitan Computer Products sent us Renegade and Quadralien - thanks again, generous dealer friends!

On to the fun: I now have a nice picture of my puppy "Bit Bucket" to send to my Amiga-owning brother, thanks to Brett's Epson 300C scanner; and I have both of my sons' voices on disk for posterity, thanks to Dave Byrne's audio equipment. Sadly, there were problems with the camera, so we couldn't capture live video. Maybe another time! The first and most interesting photo scanned was a picture of a tintype of someone's Great Grandfather, a dignified, bearded old gent who died in 1902. Brett used Art Department to get the best possible copy, playing with the resolution, contrast, brightness, etc. At first, we could see the hairs in his beard, but due to memory limitations on the destination machine, he had to cut it back to 16 shades of gray instead of 256. It was still a sight to see, though. How would Thomas Dixon react if he knew he'd been reduced to a 259K file, a hundred years after his photo was taken? Thanks to Brett for all his hardware, skill, and time, to Kevin DeRita for bringing his A4000 Toaster system, and Paul Neal for helping with the setup. IA little hint: the scanner will only work on a 4000 if you disable the memory caches before you do any scanning.J

School starts in Plano on 8/10, so I'd better warm up my Spelling List program on our Amiga. Good luck to all of you returning to school! See ya next month!

## Fort Worth Brenda Sessums

Konnichi Wa, Fort Worth!!! More fun abounds on our July 1 meeting. We had 10 regulars and two irregulars (I mean visitors). Jo Lynn went to the MCCC Bored of Directors meeting (pun intended). She learned that Amiga West is now no more. Their members will be distributed to the other Amiga chapters based on ZIP codes. [Editor's note: as noted elsewhere, the Arlington /Grand Prairie chapter has also been dissolved and its members transferred to the Fort Worth chapter.]

They asked where we wanted to be located at METCOM and we say (drum roll) in the very middle. We were the first and always the best. After all, the C64 started the MCCC, so they should show due respect for the little computer that could - and does!

Now to the meeting itself. Phil Heberer (sorry about the spelling last month!) gave us a stimulating demonstration on GEOS. He showed us printer drivers for Commodorespecific printers (they are called nine pin, but they are actually seven pin). Use the 1525 emulation or the Epson driver to run GEOS.

There was also a fun demonstration of the Incredible Musical Keyboard by Sight and Sound Music Software Incorporated. The overlay resembles a real piano keyboard, but it only fits the old-style C-64 case (rounded edges). We played Bach, Jazz and lots of other stuff. The specs for the keyboard say that it "transforms your Commodore 64 into an amazing musical instrument" ", and that even if you don't have any experience playing a piano, you'll be playing "exciting music within minutes" (how exciting and within how many minutes they didn't say). Several pieces of software let you create piano, guitar and synthesizer sounds. Music Processor and the Kawasaki Synthesizer were demonstrated and had some great music and instruments on them.

Another piece of software that was on the demo disk was 3001 a Sound Odyssey. It had a introduction that sounded like RoboCop.

Phil also showed us Commodore Netword, a C-64/C-128 specific magazine from Australia. It is much more than just a newsletter.

Loadstar has a NEW newsletter, a good one too! It discussed some of the problems QLink has been having. Also, they have put out a definitive catalog on Loadstar disks for C64 and the quarterly disk magazine for the 128. It is really nice to see what is on each of the disks before even loading one up. Commodore Country recently got a copy of this catalog on "loan" and they have quite a few copies of Loadstar back issues for sale. They also got in a copy of Little Computer People, and guess who bought it?

Y'all be there in August for more fun!!!
