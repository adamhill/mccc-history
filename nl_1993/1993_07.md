## METCOM

Yes, METCOM...coming the first week of November

Hooray, I hear you all cry — time for another visit to the good old FLEA market. But wait, that is not all...

What sort of a competition I hear you ask? Well, it is a competition that is open to all members who can generate original work on any Commodore computer.

![Image](1993_07_artifacts/image_000001_8477c89b5e70ed583826d8fed088c74813ab07a4024dfffb7992a864c3380ba6.png)

For example, Pictures, Animations, Sounds, Music, Utilities, Games... in fact anything you can think of.

The competition is FREE and open to all members and families of the MCCC. The three winners will have their entries exhibited at METCOM for all to see or experience.

In next month's newsletter, there will be an official entry form with the complete rules and deadlines, so get those thinking caps on and start creating on your Commodore Computer.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke t's been a busy month. In all there are 19 new MCCC 1 tomatio and an absona a to me sta be of animation and an unknown (at this time) number of new AmigaLibDisks from Fred Fish. Everything from Clipart to "must have" utilities. Let's get on with it.

## Desert Dreams by Kefrens

This is the animation I mentioned. It's on two disks labeled Desert Dreams. It requires a 68020 or greater processor and 1 meg of memory. It also requires that you be able to boot your machine in PAL mode — a trick that's easily accomplished with the little program called BootPal available from the library or from the BBS. I know..that's a lot of requirements for an animation, but it's worth it. This is one that will totally knock your socks off. The animation is smooth - and in many cases simply amazing — and the music fits the action beautifully. Show this one to all your PC and MAC owning friends and show them what a real computer can do.

## Interference

And Desert Dreams isn't the only outstanding animation. Interference isn't quite as mind-blowing as Desert Dreams, but I can only say that after having seen them both. There are some things here that will knock your socks right off. You'll want

to get this one as well...and it's a little more forgiving since in

68000. It has another advantage too

because it can be installed on a hard

drive. This one's on MCCC-A

549.

## Postscript Fonts

There are 10 selections on 3 disks. My picks on these include LK on MCCC-A \_537; Anette, Annika and Sleezy Bar Blues on MCCC-A \_ 538; and Nicole on MCCC-A. \_ 539.

## Amiga Boulder Dash by Jeff Bevis

But sometimes boulders

Anyone remember the game Boulder Dash from their C64 days? I sure do! For my money Boulder Dash is the best game I ever played on the C64...and there were some great games. But I don't have to long for the good old days any more. Now I can play Boulder Dash on my Amiga. And it's about time. For those who haven't played, a brief explanation. You control a miner character who is set loose in an underground area. Your character's job is to collect all the diamonds he can — a certain number of them will be required for each level - within the required time allotted and without getting squished or otherwise killed. You see, as your character digs his way toward the diamonds, he will be digging around and under boulders which, when the dirt supporting them is dug away, crash down squashing whatever happens to be below. If that happens to be your character, you get to start over. You'll also find that boulders can serve as obstacles that can block your passage if you're not careful about where you let them fall. You can move a single boulder, but only if the opposite side is free of other objects or dirt.

## EXPLOSION MEMPHIS DiSPLAY

Blippo

Most month's disks contain some Postscript fonts. Although we skipped a month or two, this month should get us back on track. You'll find a total of 21 fonts on 3 separate disks. My favorites? Look for Agate and Becker on MCCC-A\_536; Dynamo, Explosion and Quicksilver on MCCC-\_547; and Borders1, Borders2, Memphis Display, Pstarbet and Blippo on MCCC-A 548.

Amiga Boulder Dash is a faithful re-creation of the original right down to the entertaining music (but with better graphics, of course). And there is even a level editor so that you can design your own mazes. You'll want to add this one to your collection for sure. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_541.

## Wabes by Chris Richards

Amiga Boulder Dash not enough? Well, there's more to be found on MCCC-A\_550. Wabes is a new version of Pacman. I find this one to be very entertaining. The graphics are excellent and the sound effects are delightful. Wait 'til you hear the sound that goes with the granting of an extra life! This one is a little slower-moving than some Pacman style games I've seen — and the ghosts are a little dumber as well - but for someone who plays as I do, those are advantages.

## GroupInfo by Nicolas Dade

This is one of those gotta-get-it utilities I mentioned at the outset. GroupInfo works kind of like the Information tool on Workbench — but with one big difference...it will update multiple icons at one time. In other words, if, for example, you get a bunch of ReadMe files from the MCCC disks that have the default tool set to :c/PPMore and you want to change them all to fit your own system - perhaps to Sys:Utilities/MuchMore - you can select them all, activate GroupInfo,

DiskSalv2 window — Select recovery options

DiskSalv2 window — Select deleted files to recover

![Image](1993_07_artifacts/image_000004_60a67a969c54228453ea0cb7a5cf002e780940f5f615e2d10e4beca269dd80e4.png)

change the default tool, press the Execute button, and all your icons will be updated. It's simple, fast, and a lot easier than doing them one at a time by using Information. I've been using it quite a bit in preparing the MCCC disks and it works like a charm. Look for it on MCCC-A 1542!

## ToolManager by Stefan Becker

Speaking of gotta-get-it utilities, there probably is no more indispensable addition to a hard-drive based system than Tool Manager. Tool Manager isn't new, but this update - version 2.1 — adds some new features. Probably the handiest of these is the ability to drop a tool icon directly on the main Tool Manager window. Tool Manager then asks whether you want to add an executable or an executable and menu item or executable and...well, you get the idea. It's kind of a shortcut, and it makes things a lot easier to set up. If you use Tool Manager, be sure to get the update. If you don't use Tool Manager, it's time you added it to your system. This month, you'll find it on two disks: MCCC-A\_546 and MCCC-A\_547. On the first disk are the executables and documentation as well as a large collection of brushes and icons to use with the program. On the second disk is the source code. For most of us, that means the first disk is what we want. Tool Manager is distributed in archived form due to space limitations.

## DiskSalv2 by Dave Haynie

GroupInfo provides a way to update multiple icons at once

![Image](1993_07_artifacts/image_000005_39cce2341619ea41168705aedbdb05743091a6b45a025613327719223605c9b3.png)

Years ago, Dave Haynie gave us DiskSalu. It was the best and most reliable way to recover data from a damaged hard drive and to recover deleted files. It has remained so through the intervening years, but it has suffered from the lack of a reasonable interface. The program needed to be run from the CLI and has been extremely difficult to use. But no more. DiskSalv2 provides the same power that was available in the original DiskSalu, but now that power is available through a beautifully-done Intuition interface. Did I say the same power as the original? Sorry. There is more power here than the original. Need to recover a damaged disk in place? You got it! Need to be told what files you have deleted so that you can choose which ones to restore? You got it! And the deleted files are displayed complete with their directories. Just point and click. It's an indispensable utility. If you get nothing else this month, get this one! It's on MCCC-A\_554.

## Mostra by Sebastiano Vigna

For some time now Mostra has been the most powerful picture viewing utility available. This is version 2.0 and now has complete AGA support, localization, clipboard support, display database access, autoscoll capabilities and lots more. Basically, it does it all. This falls into the gotta-get-it category as well. If you don't currently use Mostra, now is the time to start. If you do, as I expect most do, get this update on MCCC-A\_554.

## ClipArt

There never seems to be an end to the flow of clipart. And for those of us who need it, I'm grateful. On MCCC-A 544 is some sample EPS clipart from Soft-Logik's huge collection. This is released as a teaser to tempt you to buy the collection, but whether you do or not, the teasers are worth having. On MCCC-A\_545 are a couple of EPS roses as well as a large selection of IFF clipart from the large PD "Grin" collection. And on MCCC-A\_548 is a collection of IFF clipart of things like police cars, school buses, tractors, and the like.

## Workbench Backgrounds

Several sets from me this month. On MCCC-A\_552 are a set of textures. These are fabric, wood, wallpaper, and the like. A little different than my normal pictures, but I think they look pretty good. On MCCC-A \_553 are more in a similar vein. These are mostly stone — marble and granite - with a like this are on MCCC-A\_554, but on this disk are some of my more normal pictures. There's a picture of a kitten and another of a sea anemone. These two are outstanding. As with all of my Workbench pics, these are all 640 x 400 pics in 16-colors.

Harold Williams couldn't stay out of the action this month either. Harold has a different Workbench setup than I do. He is unwilling to give up huge amounts of memory to a 16-color background picture, so his backgrounds are based on 4-colors...and they are brushes that can be "tiled" to provide a full background while using very little memory. These are really nice. Check 'em out on MCCC. A 550.

## PC's In The Office

from Jim Meyer downloaded from GEnie

Heh heh heh heh heh heh... We're in the process of configuring an Intel PC (486-based) at work to serve as a kind of multi-platform machine. Since we have DOSbased products, Windows-based products, OS/2-based products, and now Unix-based products, we had to throw a LOT of stuff at the machine. (The Unix is accomplished by running the machine as an X-station.)

Our techs have now spent two weeks resolving all the addressing conflicts, memory conflicts, and wonderful things like that, and the machine still locks up when you do certain things. We will probably have a list of things NOT to do posted nearby.

Of course, if the thing were an Amiga, all you'd do would be load the software, pop the cards in, turn the thing on, and run. I guess that'd put too many techs out of work, though...

The PC is what the C64 would have been if business had adopted it. 14 Zillion different ways to do the same thing, and no single standard for any of them. Can you see any other industry putting up with this?

Customer: "I can't play my Led Zeppelin CD!"

Tech: "Well, no. Not with the Orbitron III speakers. You have to use the Maltimus speakers or the EarBlaster headphones."

Customer: "Yeah, but I tried the EarBlaster headphones first. They worked fine for the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash tape I played before."

Tech: "What?? You didn't say you had a CS&amp;N tape installed! You have to remove that first, and play the first four minutes of "Bohemian Rhapsody" before loading the Led Zeppelin CD!"

Customer: "(sigh) OK. Now, what if I want to play some Pat Metheny?"

Tech: "With or without Lyle Maze?"

Customer: "Well, both!"

Tech: "(sigh) That's an unsupported mode. You can play Metheny without Maze if you're using the Umeboshi tape player with a Sturm&amp;Drang tape, or with the Hibachi CD player. But if you want to play Metheny with Maze, you have to have a Boston Pops tape playing at the same time. Oh... One more thing. MAKE SURE that you DO NOT have Showtime on, with Elayne Boozler, or HBO when anything with Chuck Norris is playing."

Customer: "&lt;: thud:.&gt;"

## There're HOW Many?

from John Benn

Y here are roughly 5 million Amigas world-wide: U.K.: 1.5 million

Germany: 1.4 million

Italy: 700,000

France: 275,000

Scandinavia: 90,000

Benelux: 45,000

Rest of Europe: 35,000

North America: 600,000

Rest of World: 400,000

There are only around 4.3 million Amiga users (many own multiple Amigas, I own 2). These numbers are looking better every month. The A1200 is selling at a rate of 60,000 units a month in the U.K. and seems to be selling rather well over here in North America as well. I think you'll see the total hit about 6 million by the end of the year if not 6.5 million. It really is a great time to be an

Amiga owner :)

## What is JPEG?

everything you never wanted to know and didn't ask from the June 8 issue of Amiga Report (a GEnie publication)

JPEG stands for the "Joint Photographic Experts Group." This is a group of experts who defined a standard compression scheme for still images, commonly called JPEG Compression.

## Overview

JPEG Compression consists of a series of reasonably complex mathematical operations. These include: color space conversion, discrete cosine transforms, quantization, and entropy coding. After these steps you end up with an image which takes fewer bits to store than you started out with.

However, when you decompress a JPEG compressed image, you end up with an image that is not quite the same as the original (which is why JPEG Compression is referred to as "lossy").

## Is lossy compression bad?

You might well ask why anyone would want to compress an image using a lossy technique. Compression ratios for lossy compression are much better than for lossless compression and the loss is generally very small. And, in fact, every operation of converting an image is lossy (the original photographic or electronic process which captured the image was lossy, scanning or digitizing the image was lossy, displaying the image on a monitor is lossy, and printing the image is lossy).

## Details

JPEG compression involves the following steps:

Step 1 - The image is converted to a color space with separate luminance and chrominance channels. This is done because the human eye is far more sensitive to the luminance before the perceived image quality suffers. This step isn't specified in the JPEG draft (it doesn't discuss color space at all), but is standard practice.

Step 2 - The luminance and chrominance information are separately transformed to the frequency domain using a discrete cosine transform acting on 8x8 pixel blocks. To reduce the amount of data which needs to be compressed the chrominance information may be sub-sampled first.

Step 3 - The transformed data is quantized (so some information is thrown away). The samples representing higher frequencies are generally quantized using larger steps than those representing low frequencies. The quality level you specify is used to scale a set of quantization values which have been found to cause the quantized data to all have approximately equal importance visually. A lower quality number will cause larger quantization steps to be used, and hence increase the compression ratio and decrease the image quality.

Step 4 — The quantized data is compressed using an entropy coder. Huffman and Arithmetic coding are allowed by the draft JPEG standard; only Huffman coding is allowed by the JFIF standard. Huffman coding can either be done with a set of fixed tables or custom tables can be generated for an image.

## JPEG Interchange Format

This data corresponds to the JPEG Interchange Format and is ready to be stored in a file. Unfortunately the JPEG Interchange Format does not include enough information to actually be able to convert the file back to an image. Specifically, the color space used and the aspect ratio or resolution of the image are not included. Until recently there was no standard way of putting this information in a JPEG file.

## JFIF

On March 1, 1991 representatives of several JPEG hardware and software developers (including C-Cube, Radius, NeXT, Storm Tech, the PD JPEG group, and Sun) met at C-Cube and established the JPEG File Interchange Format (JPIP).

## Thought Sor The Month

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The June meeting went more or less as planned. Well at least the demonstration happened this month! It really was a case of having to, since David, our President, would actually be giving th e demo/comparison of Amiga WordProcessors.

obligatory pictures etc. David also touched on some of the other Word Processors that are around, most notably WordPerfect and Excellence. A general discussion and a hands on checkout brought the meeting to a close.

The meeting begin in earnest at 7:30 pm, I believe, I have no idea if it actually did, since I was still trying to get to the meeting. However at 8:00pm (when I finally arrived) the meeting was in full swing and David was answering questions. The most interesting of these were the financial problems that Commodore is facing. Suffice to say that I think everyone has read or heard that information so on to better stuff.

The brighter news on the other side of things, is that the A4091 SCSI-2 controller is supposed to be shipping, the A1200HD is no longer being made (Commodore apparently cannot compete with the third party vendors for installing the IDE hard drives). They are still manufacturing A1200's though. Commodore also stopped manufacturing the A600 for the U.S. market, but you can still get one from one of the big mail order places. Other interesting things for those of you with GVP accelerators is a $2000 video board for that 32-bit slot on the GVP accelerator boards. A bit pricey I hear you say, but the specifications are really impressive!

Eventually we came to the long awaited Word-Processor shake down. David, armed with his new A3000, had copies of ProWrite and Final Copy 2 loaded and ready for action. These being the two most popular and currently available packages for the Amiga, which was the criteria he used. David went through the two packages showing off their good and bad points for all to see. He even included printed matter with

Thanks, David, for the excellent critique and demonstration of two of the most popular Amiga Word-Processors.

Now, as premiered in last months report...the WHAT'S THE LOOP DOING NEXT MONTH? section.

The next Amiga-By-The-Loop presentation is at the time of writing unknown, which is shameful, really, on my part for not finding out! However, I do know that full details of the METCOM Competition will be available at the next meeting!

Well, that's it for this month. We hope to see you at our next meeting of the Amiga By-The-Loop.

## Amiga Central

Johnny Kitchens

June has its advantages for our club meetings. School is over and reruns are in progress. While "Cheers" nearly choked our May meeting out, our June meeting looked truly overflowing. Still, I wonder where everyone else was. This meeting, as usual, started off with its question and answer session, and with the larger than usual turnout there were more than usual to work with. There was a question on Intuition. What is it? Never realized that it was such a tough question. Can you answer that one simply? Last month a question about updating WordPerfect came up. This month that person told us that the help he got actually worked. He called for the update as instructed, and he got it. Another question was on ARexx. How do you get it and how do you use it? This brought up several answers from buy 2.0 or 2.1, to buy ARexx itself. Buying ARexx itself has the advantage of getting the buyer a manual, which would help with the second part of the question. A question on how to use Postscript fonts with Final Copy 2 came up. Apparently it needs the file with PFB at the end. Someone asked how files make it from the BBS to the club disks. Everyone got a laugh from that answer. Someone had problems with setting up JRComm. I believe we straightened that problem out very well. Have you ever wondered how to photograph or videotape a TV screen? Someone at the meeting wondered just that and several good answers were offered. A plea for help came from Pete Goad. He's asking for help with METCOM. If you have a little free time and can lend a hand give Pete a call. A reminder of GVP day at Metropolitan was given. That's a worthy thing to attend, but for obvious reasons I've wished in the past that I was the only one there.

From there we moved into our rumor time, and as it has been the past few months the rumors are few and far between. The A4091 is available! This is the SCSI 2 hard drive controller that the 4000 people have been impatiently waiting for since the 4000 arrived. With it comes news that the super Buster chip will have to be updated as well. The A4091 gives the Amiga 4000 super speed for its hard drives. This will be a new world in many ways for hard drive controllers. Take, for instance, the 50 pin high density D. Sub external connector it has. Try and find that just anyplace! It's only here recently that some computer stores have begun to know what Im talking about when I say scuzzy. Another rumor was the availability of the 1200 for $399 and the 4000 for $1900 mail order. Maybe Commodore has noticed that their prices are a tad high compared to the competition.

## CHAPTER NEWS

Our presentation of the month came to us via Brett Hester. If you haven't attended a presentation from Brett you are truly missing out. To say he goes all out is an understatement. For this one he brought a 4000, a 2500, a CDTV, and enough accessories to fill up a cart to demonstrate an Epson 24 bit flat bed scanner. Using Art Department Scanner Control Brett proceeded to scan images, and the results were amazing. Seeing this thing in operation was amazing in itself. First, it scans the whole image, then you select a portion if you so desire and the scanner rescans that portion allowing you to fill the screen with that portion. Time and time again the results looked photo quality. Only gold appeared to have a problem. Several gold colored objects turned out green on the screen. We wondered why, 'but no conclusion was reached. Several people brought pictures to be digitized. The results were, as before, dazzling. If you weren't at the meeting you missed out. All of that equipment running together was worth the trip, though I'm still wondering what part the CDTV played in the operation.

member to alert them to the change, and those who still came last month looking for the "Digitize Your World" celebration had Brett Hester's setup available for their digitizing needs after the meeting. We will definitely be having the promised special event at the July meeting - bring your pictures, sounds, videos, etc. to be captured to disk. We'll try to be sure everyone gets a chance at their favorite media. Instead of the digitizing stuff, in June we were treated to a look at Toaster 4000: more on that below. I'm glad I made it back, after a few months' absence — all our officers were present and accounted for, and it was great to be on the scene again. Next month will also be "Bring a Friend Month"...so bring someone along to join the fun! If your friend has any ideas for demos or presentations, please introduce them to Brett — he always welcomes any suggestions on what you would like to see at your meetings.

Coming in July? A demonstration and explanation of typeSMITH, the new font editing tool from Soft-Logik. This is your chance to see it work first hand. Be there!

With the closing of the June meeting 50% of this year's meeting have come and gone. Seems like yesterday that I noticed that 25% had gone. Wait a little longer and the whole year will be gone.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Well, I finally had the scoop on what our meeting would be about in June...and they had to postpone it! Our President Danny Barnett tried to call every Amiga North Dallas

Here are the June tidbytes: Watch for the Dallas Video Festival, coming November 11-14, at the Dallas Museum of Art. They are still accepting submissions of your Amiga artistry (deadline 8/2) if you have something to show off.

Weird Peripheral of the Month Department: Danny Barnett has interfaced an old Nintendo Power Glove to an Amiga as a mouse pointer! He constructed the interface cable himself, and has access to PD software to calibrate and interface the device. You can configure it in various ways, like the thumb motion for the right mouse button and the fingers for the left. Might be a . REALLY interesting way to run some games. However, if you have an itch you might accidentally format your hard drive...

We discussed the gloomy news from Commodore - stocks and the present USA employee count terribly low, and rumors about USA closing down and Commodore Europe going international. Worrisome. Brighter notes: "Babylon 5" seems to have been picked up as a series; rumors describe a games console developed in Europe; Amigas were used (only in pre-production) in "Jurassic Park." [AWESOME critters!] Someone was searching for support for the Excellence product — any help out there? Ned Kelly had an A2000 for sale with add-ons, only $600. If you're interested, see if it's still at large by the time you read this. There was also a copy of the latest Lemmings for sale — check in at the next meeting to see if it's gone. A couple of our members had taken advantage of a special MCCCMember Deal on Caligari 2, and their software had come in. (Yet another Advantage of Membership!) Our Shareware pick-of-the-month was Term, a terminal communications program.

Dave Marshall was the star of the evening, with his presentation of the latest and greatest Toaster 4000. The new Toaster runs only on a 4000. The hardware will run on lesser systems, but the software's best features use the AGA chip set. What we saw was "beta software" - the actual release is pending — but the new features are wonderful. I liked the addition of sound effects to transitions, like a ripping-page effect, or a flash of lightening with appropriate thunderclap. They've added transparency as an option, and make flamboyant new use of color. They offer AGA-based animations as transitions, like "Kikibell" — youknow who appearing with her Tinkerbell wand to "poof" the scene change into being. There's a 3-D "entering Warp Drive" transition that's a work of art. There are 9 banks of 32 separate effects to choose from. The character generator has been updated, too. In exploring "Lightwave 3D", we saw a 5-meg animation of a shiny little toaster. No cutesy cartoon here — she was made of shiny chrome and you could

## CHAPTER NEWS

count the crumbs on her toast. We were told that 16 meg of RAM can store about 6 seconds of full animation. Lo-res images passed through anti-aliasing (to smooth curves, etc.) came out looking great. Awesome, Dave - thanks!

John liked and demonstrated was called Private Eye. It is much like Clue, but it is easier to play. Disk #527 has a program called Car Costs, as well as 12 other games.

Yep, more doorprizes: our good friends at Metropolitan Computing brought us This Game is No Pushover and Robocop 3, and an exceedingly generous Anonymous Donor offered the Panorama fractal landscape package, a My Paint Coloring Book of The African Rainforest [that's the one I wanted to leave with. *sigh*], and a 600 Color Clip Art package. We offer our thanks again to those who share their goodies and make our meetings more fun. Looking forward to next month! Last but not least, Danny Barnett had a new Eurodemo called Interface to show those stragglers remaining after the prizes were gone. It was impressive, of course: I was particularly intrigued by bouncing cubes with running animations playing on various faces of each cube. How???? Beyond me. Come join us in July for more surprises and excitement!

Hello, Incredible Commodore Universe!

In June we had a newsletter from San Antonio. There was also a Software Support International catalog that was passed around. It has both new and used software. To appropriate one for yourself, call 1800-356-1179. One of the programs that our Vice President, John Burke demonstrated was as follows: Financial Cookbook — 43 formulas for financial what ifs by Electronic Arts. (Software Support International has it. Mr. Hebert I have yours.) Another program that

Disks O'Plenty Inc. has shareware. You can write them at 8362 Pines Blvd, Suite 270, Pembroke Pines, Fl 33024. Their number is (305) 963-7750. There is a monthly on disk magazine called Cee-64 Alive. It had a great opening screen and a nice menu. It also had an article on the all new C-64 called the Dark 64. For more information on this new 64 (or the magazine) contact a Fort Worth Chapter member.

Brenda Sessums brought a nifty little 4-color plotter that we got to play with at the meeting. It was very accurate, although the printouts are limited to a 4" piece of paper.

Now we take a little trip in a time machine and wind up in May! Here's what happened with the two meetings we had last month: We had 15 members attend both meetings during May. John Burke started off the regular meeting with a monitor problem. He had embarrassed the monitor and it turned red! He then demonstrated the Luscher Profile. It is a weird program, but fun! It is a personality profile by color. We also had the King James Version of the New Testament, The Bible. This is available on Disk #734 for the C-64, and #727 for the C-128. Disk #835 was also demonstrated by John. It had a geography game, a bartender's helper, dominoes, and algebra to mention just a few. Submitted by James Dunnam for our gaming pleasure were the most frequently used letters in the English language: "ETAOIN SHRDLU." John demonstrated Stereo Player 9.1. It is compatible with most SIDPlayer music.

Our special meeting on May 11 went great! We had guest speakers from Commodore Country (Brad Jackson and Bobby Ward) gave us some demonstrations and some insight on some of the products they carry (as well as some custom products they were working on). They have the only authorized Commodore bench-testing station in this area. By the way, they do repairs and diagnostics on all Commodore machines (C-64, C-128 and Amigas) and are just darnright friendly and helpful. Also, they have these machines for sale, too, with better warranties than Commodore had on the brand new ones! These guys get business from over 3000 happy Commodore owners in the Metroplex alone. They also get business delivered by UPS from all over the U.S. They also have some great software for all of these Commodore formats for rent and for sale. Oooh, you should have seen the nifty joysticks Brad showed us. One was a an aircraft yoke with an artificial horizon gadget in the center that would be great for the flight simulator games. Another one was a helicopter joystick that had a flip-up safety switch on the ordinance (fire) button. That one would be great for Gunship! One that Bobby, CC's technician, showed was a set of infrared remote controller pads that could be used on the C-64, C-128, Amiga or Genesis. It was pretty sharp, too.

Commodore Country is located in Burleson, and they are the largest CMD dealer in the country. Be sure to call before you go to get eeesy directions and just follow the neon pink Commodore Country signs. Give 'em a call at (817) 295-7658. Remember, they let you try it before you buy it. So get out there and try it!

Effective this month, the Amiga West Chapter has discontinued meeting. Members affiliated with that chapter are welcome at any chapter meeting they choose. Let us know which chapter to transfer your affiliation to.
