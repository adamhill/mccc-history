## W.O.C.

## World Of Commodore report by Matt Guthrie from the South Bay Computer Groups newsletter

irst off, let me state that I thought long and hard about which newsgroup to post this in. Not all of it is directly hardware related, but I wanted a big audience, and I refuse to subscribe to advocacy, so I chose hardware. I thought about announce, but I couldn't find Dan Zerkle's email address, and all the articles have expired at our site, so I couldn't look it up. It he wants to post this, or if Dan Barrett wants to post this to comp.sys.amiga, reviews, it's not a problem.

I only attended Saturday, and only attended the two seminars by CBM: one about Commodore's plans, and the second about the FMV card for the CD32. I took detailed notes at the first one, but left my notebook in the car when we went for lunch, and didn't have it for the second one.

## Jim Dionne

The first seminar was by Jim Dionne, president of C=US, and Lew Eggebrecht, VP Engineering for C=, Jim started out by recapping C='s performance over the last year. Obviously it wasn't good, but he gave some good reasons. First of all, 80% of C='s business is in Europe, and the worldwide recession hit Europe hard last year, as it did the US in 90-91. The dollar rose against the British pound and the Deutsche mark, so that meant less money for C= (because most of their business is in non-US currencies). European PC margins finally began eroding as they did in the US a couple of years ago. Due to this, C= had large inventory writedowns and other accounting losses. Jim stressed that most of the loss was not an operating loss, and intimated that the company is still healthy operating wise.

He then explained the company's reorganization plan. C= will de-emphasize PC's and concentrate on Amigas, since that's their area of expertise. Like most companies, they are reducing staff, consolidating, and streamlining their operations to reduce costs.

A few major changes will be:

1. Changing the current policy of a distribution center in each country to having 2 or 3 major distribution centers for all of Europe.
2. Consolidating manufacturing to their new plant in the Phillipines.
3. Their new and exciting products.

Specific to the US, Jim said:

1. C= will no longer sell direct to dealers; they'll sell to a few regional distributors only. This will allow them to streamline paperwork, accounting, etc.
2. They've outsourced their service program. Jim admitted that C='s service has had problems, and outsourcing it to a company that only focuses on service will improve it.
3. C= will emphasize the 4000 in the video and animation markets. The 1200 is a tough sell against 386/486 systems, and while not abandoning the line, they're not going to put much behind it.

## Some other notes:

1. C= will really stress the CD32, not just as a game machine, but for kiosk and corporate training &amp; presentation systems.
2. The 4000T will be out before year-end. Features include 2 video slots, SCSI on the motherboard, 5 23 slots, and 5 drive bays.
3. The CD32 will be introduced on a limited scale in the US in November. (One of the main reasons is C= can't

build enough to satisfy the projected demand. The Phillipines plant is producing 20,000 each week.) The full-scale media blitz will begin withe the January CES show in Las Vegas. MSRP will be under $400 for the base unit.

4. The CD32 will be sold "everywhere Sega is sold." That means Wal-Mart and similar stores. Jim said they were considering some new advertising ideas, and specifically mentioned 30-minute info-mercials as a distinct possibility.

5. The CD32-compatible drives for AGA Amiga will be available after the introduction of the FMV card for the CD32 in November.
6. The cost of a CD32 + FMV card will be less than a 3DO system.

## Lew Eggebrecht

Lew Eggebrecht's talk was composed of 2 parts: the CD32 and the status of development projects at C=.

The CD32 project began at the same time as the 1200. C= learned a lot from CDTV, one of the most important of which was if you advertise it as being able to do all this stuff (as CDTV was), consumers get confused. So, with CD32, they designed another highly expandable system, but aren't going to tell consumers, "By the way, your CD32 can do that and that and that, too.") Also, C= spent a lot of time asking customers, developers, etc., what they wanted, and Lew thinks they've done it.

Since it's being billed as a games machine, it has to be competitive with Sega. At it's intro price of f299UK, it's less than the Sega CD unit, and approximately 15X more performant.

Here are some technical specs:

- AGA chipset, Motorola 68EC020, 2MB RAM (Chip), 1 MB ROM (ADOS 3.1).
- Sony CD mechanism with C= microcode (2X multisession-capable) (that means it can read PhotoCD's but no Kodak license yet).
- 1KB EEprom for hi-score tables, bootmarks, etc.
- 4 voice Amiga stereo, 16-bit CD stereo, stereo line out, headphone jack with volume control.
- RF out (built-in modulator), composite out, S-Video out (Lew said that S-Video out gives dramatic video improvement).
- With the AGA chipset, every pixel can be a different

color at standard TV resolutions. (I suppose that's not the case if you're using S-Video.)

- Aux port with 2 serial ports, compatible with the Amiga keyboard.

Lew finished his talk by discussing some of the ongoing projects at C=.

AAA Chipset: First pass of silicon has been completed and they had the OS up and running, , "blitting around 24bit objets" and such. Second silicon pass is scheduled for this month. C= expects to have a full-functioning AAA Amiga system by 1Q94. Systems could be shipped by 3Q94, unless multiple more silicon passes are required.

4000 Tower: Production of this system has been delayed by the rampup of CD32. There was a system (open to view) at he Commodore booth with a big sticker saying something like, "This product has not yet received FCC approval — Not for Sale." As I stated in part 1, they expect it to ship by year end.

4091 SCSI-2 card: My notes get sketchy. Something about "negotiations with 3rd parties not yet completed." C= is restarting production and the 4091 should be available in 6-8 weeks.

DSP board: Project put on hold by CD32. Will be restarted after Jan. 1.

CD add-on for AGA Amigas: Will ship before year end, maybe slightly after Christmas.

RTG: Will be coupled with new AAA system, mid-late next year.

Networking: This was a little distressing. C= is willing to give their networking technology away to a 3rd party, basically for free. Seems like they have no networking expertise left in-house and are counting on someone else to take up the slack. If I only had a few hundred thousand to start my own company...

AmigaDOS 3.1: Available 6-8 weeks. First release will be for A4000, later for older machines, but it will have a different nomenclature (it won't be called AmigaDOS 3.1).

RISC: First, Lew rhetorically asked, "Why RISK?" He answered himself by saying that would add graphics acceleration, i.e., realtime 3D rendering, and multiple OS support like Windows NT and UNIX. He said that C= has not made a final decision yet, and listed some of the choices, with pros and cons. He did say that the Alpha was probably beyond C='s price point, and hinted that PARISC (by Hewlett-Packard) looks attractive due to their good multimedia support. (My bet is this is the one C= picks.)

He stressed that C= will continue to support the Motorola line and AmigaDOS, and that anything for RISC would be in addition to AmigaDOS. Target for an Amiga RISC system is 1995.

Regarding the Motorola line, Lew said he met with execs at Motorola last week, and support of the 68060 is assured, and Motorola even said they will continue to provide stuff beyond the 68060.

Well, this article is getting a little long, but rather than break it into four parts, I'll just forge ahead and talk about the FMV card.

## Jeff Porter

The second seminar was by Jeff Porter and???? (whoops, I've forgotten his name) from C= International. Let me first say that Jeff Porter is absolutely hilarious and I'd really enjoy working for him (yeah, right, like that's ever gonna' happen).

As I said in part one, I didn't take notes at this, so there's a lot I've forgotten. What I do remember are the demos of the board. I can sum up my impressions in 3 words: ABSOLUTELY FREAKIN' AMAZING. They had a demo CD with 3 music videos on it: Bon Jovi's "Blaze of Glory," one by Enya, land Seal's "Killer." They had a projectionTV setup, and I'm serious, you could not tell it wasn't broadcast. Full-screen, full-motion video. The presenters pointed out artifacts like the sun reflecting off Jon Bon Jovi's guitar, but it was REALLY nit-picky. You have to know what you're looking for, and probably have to have the original next to it to differentiate.

The interface for the VideoCD is very similar to the CDTV audio CD interface. It's a little cleaner though, and the : compact disc digital audio" logo is a nice touch.

They spent some time talking about MPEG and VideoCD technology, which bored most everyone. The demos were the thing, and they were mind-blowing.

Some final thoughts. There have been a lot of threads about C= is doomed, C= can't do anything right, etc. (and I don't mean just on advocacy, because I don't read that one). Well, from what I saw at WOCA, C= is doing some things right. It seemed very clear to me that they're betting the farm on CD32 (Jim Dionne said they expect it to be the next C64, which sold 17 million units). If you guys want to save C=, buy a CD32 and tell your friends (not just your Amiga friends) to buy one as well. Stop whining about, "will it plug into my 1200/4000/3000?" Buy it replace your Nintendo. Invite your friends over after you get one so they can see all the cool games you have, then tell them it's less than the Sega CD system, and WAY less than 3DO. Try doing something constructive to help, rather than whining all the time. J

## METCOM

it's over for another year by Okley Moss etCom 93 has passed and it was a nice Thank goodness don't have to put on such a show every week.

We had 357 guest and members that signed in at the desk. There were 102 members and they brought 42 members of their family for a total of 144. That left 213 guests attending - and from that number 11 signed up as new members or as renewing members whose membership had lapsed.

35 guests said they saw the ad in the newspaper or Thrifty Nickel. Several saw it carried on other bulletin boards and one saw it on StarText. 6 had picked up a flyer from Metropolitan. One also saw it on Paragon cable. Our newsletter exchange program let 6 people read about us and come from San Antonio and Abilene to attend. People came from such distant places as Mineral Wells, Killeen, Denton, Sequin and even Mineral Spring, Arkansas.

We received 46 membership renewals. We now have 34 whose membership expires in 1995...the latest is September. 8 reapplications and 10 new members (7 Amiga and 3 C-64/128) were received

Lessons were well attended and the computer set up to call the BBS was in operation for a good period of time. This was handled by David Davidson. The dealers seemed to be rather helpful and good natured and people commented that they seemed to want to help rather than just stand around.

Thanks to all the helpers in the flea market, and with the library and registration table, and with the membership sign up. The instructors also deserve a nice round of applause since they not only had to be in attendance and not visit around but had to prepare their lessons and supplies in advance. I would rate it as a successful computer show. If there are any suggestions for the next year on how to improve, please come forward and we will put you in charge. Kidding, of course, but we would like to have any constructive help in the planning of next year's show.

## Window on the World

telecommunicating with your C64 or C128 by Phil Heberer have a window on the world, almost literally. By 1 a catomi network like Fiane, can see an International network like Fidonet, I can "see" half way around the world. I've held conversations fairly regularly with individuals as far away as Australia. I've developed a network of new friends that spans three continents. So, how is this possible, you ask? Well, it's relatively easy, and anyone with a computer and a modem can participate. There are several networks available that share or pass on information. Internet and Fidonet are probably the best known, but there are others as well. For purposes of this article, I will be referring to f'idonet, since that's the only one for the moment to which I have local access (and it's FREE!).

If you've been to any of our Ft. Worth Chapter meetings of the MCCC, you've probably heard me harping about not getting the full benefit of your computer if you're not "connected." Getting started in telecommunications need not be expensive. If you already have a C64/128, you already have the major component. With the advent of ever-faster modem speeds, cost on lower-speed modems is quickly coming down, especially in the used market. If you don't have a modem, even the 300 baud VICModem will get you on-line, and one of those can be had for $5 or less these days. For resonable speed and better use of limited time on some BBS systems, a 2400 baud modem is recommended. The Aprotek Minimodem 24C seems to be good choice for a direct-connect modem for the Commodore 8-bit machines. If you ever plan on using a faster modem than a 2400 baud on a C64/128, Id recommend you invest in a SwiftLink RS-232 interface manufactured by Creative Micro Designs, which can then be connected with any of the high-speed modems available today.

Now that you know what hardware you'll need, how about software? Here again there are many choices. For the Commodore 128, Desterm V2.0 (a shareware program) and Dialogue V2.2d (a commercial program) seem to be the most popular choices. For the C64, NovaTerm V9.4, a shareware program by Nick Rossi seems to be the most popular choice, especially with its ability to handle 80-col color ANSI screens so prevalent on many BBSs these days. If you deal exclusively with Commodore 8-bit BBSs (a rarity these days!), one of the many Commodore colorgraphics terminal programs like ProTerm or MultiTerm might be more useful. [Desterm and NovaTerm are available in the MCCC Disk Library.]

Now that you have the hardware and software required, and get connected, what do you do next? My favorite pastime is reading the Commodore-specific Fidonet echos. There are users of every level of ability in the Fido "community," and they are all willing to help if you have a problem. For local access in the Fort Worth area to this plethora of information, try calling Metroplex Mailbox BBS at Metro (817) 268-1422. There are also several Fido boards in the Dallas region, but I don't have those numbers handy. Metroplex Mailbox is a very busy BBS, with an average of 50-60 callers per day on a single telephone line, but persistence will pay off (and an automatic redialer in most of the terminal programs mentioned will help!).

To make best use of your allocated time, and to give other users equal access, you should look into acquiring an off-line reader (OLR). Fortunately for the C64/128 users, we have not been left out. QWKRR V3.5 is available for the 128 users, and QWKie V1.0 is available for C64 users (both programs are shareware, and are available on line or in the MCCC Disk Library). You will also want to pick up CSX01.SDA and UNZIP101.SFX while you're at it. These are the unpackers you might need for the QWK mail packets you will download. Here is a list of the packers/unpackers our equipment is compatible with:

| IBM name (mode)                                                        | CBM name                                                          | Mode                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| LHArc 2.xx (LH-5,6) PKPak 3.61/LHArc 1.13 PKZIP 1.xx (or just ZIP) ARJ | PMAUTOE.COM CSX01.S UNZIP BVUNZIP UNZIP.COM CPMUNARJ.ARK 128 CP/M | 128 CP/M 64 or 128 64 128 128 CP/M |

As you can see, the C64 doesn't have very many options, but fortunately the Sysop of Metroplex Mailbox is compassionate and has installed LHArc113 as a packer for the Commodore users. [If you do log-on, you might thank the Sysop for keeping the Fido echos accessible for us. Not all sysops have been so generous or caring about the "old" technology our machines represent.] Once you have downloaded your QWK mail packet, extracted it with either CSX01 or UNZIP101, and loaded and run your OLR, you are ready to view the world at your leisure.

I have over-simplified a few things here, but if you have any problems feel free to contact me at (817) 8478232. You can also leave me E-mail on the MCCC BBS or on Metroplex Mailbox. I'd be happy to assist in any way possible to get you on-line with your own window on the world. You will be astounded at the amount of information available.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke iskSalv2 by Dave Haynie A month or two ago, I featured a program called DiskSalu2. DiskSalu2 is the best way I know of to repair broken disks, recover deleted files, etc. The shareware fee is only $10, which makes it one of the best bargains to be found anywhere. Not a whole lot has changed here, but some bugs have been squashed for this release (revision 11.28). Also included is some information on the upcoming DiskSalv3 which will be a commercial product. It's all on MCCC-A\_619.

## ToolsDaemon by Nico Francois

While we're on the subject of upgrades, a new version (2.1) of ToolsDaemon is also included on this month's disks. ToolsDaemon, for those who are unfamiliar with the program, is a small utility that allows you to add menus to the Workbench. This means that you can activate PageStream or Term or DiskSalv2 or any other program of your choice just by pulling down a menu and selecting an item. This eliminates the endless opening of widow after window to get to your most often used software. This version kills a few bugs, improves the interface even more, and adds a few new features. It's on MCCC-A\_617.

## Galactoid by Clay Hellman

For all you old (or not so old) Galaga fans out there, there is another Galaga style game available this month. It's called Galactoid, it's on MCCC-A\_619, and it's a whole lot of fun. In order to successfully run it you need to have never used Commodore's CPU program. Other than that it seems to run with any configuration. Check it out.

## Pictures

Another keeper is Van Gogh's "Starry Night" on MCCC-A \_ 617. It's a nice digitization. A 24-bit JPEG version is included as well as a 16-color conversion done by me and Art Department Professional.

For all you picture collectors, this month's disks feature a new version of that old favorite "Butterfly Fish" (or Buttfish as BBS users are likely to remember it as). This one is still designed for non-AGA machines but is very detailed and lifelike — much more so that the earlier version we've had kicking around for the last few years. You'll need Mostra to view it (included on the disk). It's on MCCC-A 619.

And for fans of Patrick Nagel, here are some more additions for your collection. There are several on MCCC-A\_615... more on MCCC-A\_616 — eight in all.

## Workbench Pics

I've been at it again. On MCCC-A 616, for the strong of heart, are five more pictures that I have modified to serve as backdrops on a 16-color, 640 x 400 Workbench. Everything from a newer, better Astronaut pic to a special version of Van Gogh's "Starry Night" to the a Chicago harbor to a nice digitized pic of a group of penguins. I hope you enjoy them.

## WBTris by Ralf Pieper

What would a month be without a new Tetris game? It does sometimes seem as if this game would max out at some point and that there would be no more implementations possible, but the fact is it remains one of the most addictive games around and so I guess we should expect people to continue to provide us with what they consider to be the best version. It so happens that WBTris - this month's addition - is one of the better Tetris implementations. It plays in a window right on the Workbench — it works on screens of any number of colors - the action is smooth - the controls are easy to master - it multitasks well - and it automatically goes into Pause when another window is activated. Even more important, it allows me to play for quite some time before becoming too fast to keep up with. Be sure to check this one out. It's on MCCC-A 1618.

## Shadow of the Beast Ill

a Usenet Review by Rob Morton

B RIEF DESCRIPTION Shadow of the Beast 3 (known for the rest of this article as Beast 3) is a side scrolling action game with puzzles, just to keep the mind working.

## AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

Name:

Address:

Psygnosis

29 Saint Mary's Court Brookline, MA 02146 USA

South Harrington Street Sefton Street

Liverpool, United Kingdom L3 4BQ

## LIST PRICE

Probably around $50.00.

## COPY PROTECTION

Oh yeah. This game has disk based copy protection. I make backups of all my software using hardware copiers, and compared to other Psygnosis games this was milder.

## MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

A500, 1 Meg RAM, Kickstart 2.04

A2000, 3 Megs of RAM, Kickstart 1.3

A1000, 512K RAM, Kickstart 1.2

## REVIEW

Well, I hated the original Shadow Of The Beast, because it was just an arcade game with great graphics. Beast 2 had average graphics, with puzzles, but without using cheats it was way too hard. Beast 3 on the other hand seems to have the graphics and the puzzles. The puzzles start out easy and progressively get more difficult. It is the type of game that you can get better and the movements, so the levels that are hard at first become easier to do later.

By getting easier with skill, it makes the game possible to complete, but makes the game not have as much replayability. You can see everything there is to see pretty quickly. I am not saying that it has no enjoyment after solving it, because I still enjoy playing it now, but I do not play it anywhere nearly as much as before.

Controlling your character is very easy. It is all joystick control except for switching between items, and that does not have to be done in the heat of battle. I think by the time they got to the third Beast game, rsygnosıs learned all of the tricks to programming a well controlled character while maintaining graphics speed and sound.

## DOCUMENTATION

The manual is very well organized. It starts out with the story of what you have done so far, and what is still left to do. After this they explain the controls very well. That is about all the documentation, but it is also all that is needed.

## LIKES AND DISLIKES

Well if it is not too obvious by now, I liked this game. It was fun. There are not that many games that I like; actually, when my computer is on I rarely play games. For some reason, I just enjoyed this one. I am not the most skilled player for strategy, and am not that quick on shooters, and I found this game well made for my gameplaying ability. I love graphics, and this game has them. Some of the backgrounds were astonishing. I also liked the music. It did not get annoying like some games do.

The main thing I did not like was that it had disk based copy protection. This is an outdated concept that needs to be done away with. I will not buy a game that has it (my roommate owns Beast 3). It is also completely useless (I made backups of this game fairly easily). It should also be hard drive installable. The last thing that many people would probably like is for the game to be slightly harder and maybe longer. Longer I would like but not really harder.

For all future games, I hope Psygnosis either learns that people have hard drives, or starts puttings its games on CD-ROM discs. This would make the games bigger, and left on one disk. I really hate disk swapping.

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

This game has the graphics of Shadow of the Beast, and the puzzles from Shadow of the Beast 2. It is perfectly detailed. There are no other games that have held my attention long enough to finish them, so I would have to say it is one of the best games I have played.

## BUGS

None that I have found.

## VENDOR SUPPORT

I never needed to talk to Psygnosis for anything.

## WARRANTY

The warranty is that they guarantee the disks work, and are free from any viruses.

## CONCLUSIONS

Johnny Kitchens

The holiday seasons are rapidly approaching as I write this, and by the time you read it one of those holidays will already be passed. Hope you had a good one and an even better one to come!

Our meeting started off with the customary officers' election. Getting a little slow here as there are no competitors for the positions. The advantage of this setup is that those that are elected are responsible and capable people who know what they are doing. The next part was to announce chapter officers who will be voted on next month. A similar situation here — just one person to vote on for each position. At least we keep stirring them around a little.

Our ever popular question and answer session started out with a question on how well METCOM went. A very thorough overview of the event was presented. I was there and didn't realize so much had happened! Next someone asked what was the latest on CD-32. We can only hope it's great! Also, will we see it before Christmas? Someone popped a question on the availability of 2.0 and 2.1. Apparently they are getting hard to find. This led to 3.1. Apparently due out soon, this new OS promises a lot of improvement to keep us moving for a few more years. A question on how to hook up a printer and scanner to a switch box. Did seem like it was hard after hearing the answer. The next two questions involved getting NickPrefs and SuperDark up and running. It's all in the installation. Monitor selection was the next topic. Apparently with all the new graphic settings being made available to the Amiga, monitors are in need of updating. Face it — the 1080 or 1084 monitors just aren't going to cut it. Maybe an article on how to select monitors was mentioned. Any volunteers!

Our main presentation involved two new products that have certainly excited everyone. Picasso II and Emplant were the featured topics. Apparently there is a lot of interest in these two wonder cards as I noticed our meeting being about the best attended meeting of the year. Jon Brdecka supplied us with the presentation again. If you missed his previous appearance, he showed us Retina. The Picasso II is one of the all new 24-bit graphic cards that offers new resolutions and colors not previously available directly to the Amiga. The Picasso II sets new speed standards for these new generation of cards, with its on-board blitter offering an advantage over the Retina. Its Cirrus Logic graphic chip will also show up on the GVP Spectrum and DKB Picollo card. Their performance should be similar. The Picasso II call to fame is the Retargatable Graphics capability. This is not the same as Commodore has talked about in the past, but a setup that allows you to direct many programs to use the card for their output. Anything that can't use the card is simply passed through. This eliminates the complication of the Retina card which needed two monitors or a switch of cables. The Picasso Il's display was great and the images shown were rock steady and brilliant. Another advantage of the Picasso II is that it is recommended for the Emplant card, the other part of our presentation.

The Emplant and Picasso II combination provide the Amiga with a Macintosh emulation that blows Macintosh LC II away. Jon's 3000 has a 28mhz 68040 accelerator card in it that helps in this respect, but the combination of the two cards really shines when emulating the Mac. I realized that emulating the Mac isn't for everyone, but it certainly offers another mode of operation on the Amiga which further expands its usefulness.

Carried to its extreme, the Emplant allows the Amiga to emulate the Mac which could emulate the IBM, which of course would be the end of the emulation trail. Utilities Unlimited, creator of the Emplant, promise modules that allow 486, Quadra, Sega Genesis, Nintendo SNES, Atari computers, and much, much more in the future. I'm sure all of this hinges on the success of the present setup. The software has gone through many revisions, and even the Mac OS is going through a rewrite to help the emulation. Time will tell if it's successful in reaching all of their goals. As it stands, the Amiga has one more card to enhance its performance and one more to expand its horizons.

Next month we look at another fascinating card...GVP's Phone Pak, which offers a new way to use the Amiga. Come on out and take a look - I'm sure it will give you something to think about in December.

## Amiga North Dallas

Genny White

Hey, where was everybody last month? I found my way to our new location and saw only about 20 diehards had made it with me. Come on, guys, it's easy... Get to the LBJ service road westbound, just past the Preston Road Exit. You can't miss the King of Glory church - lovely arches out front. Turn into the parking lot (2nd entrance is "in"), go around back and all the way around to the northeast corner. There's the door to their Sanctuary. We're just down the stairs you'll find to the left of the door. I was surprised that coming down 75 from Plano didn't take much longer than it did to exit at Arapaho in days gone by. You'll want to join us in December — our traditional Fun and Games meeting! Bring your friends, your Amiga and your favorite game software to share.

## CHAPTER NEWS

Bring munchies, too! Be sure to bring all the cables, power cords, etc. you'll need. We'll find a table and a wall plug for you. See you on 2rd Tuesday!

News Bytes: Alex Dominguez has an A500 with a new 1084 monitor, 3 external drives, lots of extras and 200 games and applications for sale, asking $850. Call him at 466-0048. Brett sez NewTek was in town at Accent Audio and Video, showing off 4000 stuff. Metropolitan is having another Amiga Day celebration in December - this may not reach you in time but we're all on their mailing list so hope you went by. (Yet another benefit of membership in a club with connections with great dealers. Metropolitan Computer Products has been supportive and generous with its help, information, support and goodies for all the years Amiga North Dallas has been around. Thanks, friends.) Gus Reiter still has Stuff left over from the flea market at MetCom. PLEEZ come collect your stuff, if you had items in his keeping. We will have a mini flea-market at the December meeting, but each one will be responsible for handling his/her own items for sale.

hiding so you wouldn't get nominated for something? We voted to unanimously accept the slate of Club officers as nominated, then we TRIED to hold nominations for our chapter. One by one, the resisting current staff were dragged to the altar of Community Service and forced with hot coals and threats of reincarnation as a Lemming to sign up for another year. Danny Barnett will return as President (whimper), Brett Hester will be Vice President (if no one else will do it...whining and pleading "Don't Blame Me!" all the way), William Dockendorf will remain at his lonely library station, and good ol' Gus Reiter will be back as Treasurer (we promised he could sit where he could see the demo next year). I, however, have other things to do. I have made other plans. I have planned my Last Newsletter Farewell. I have accepted renomination. (*sigh*) Somehow, I couldn't stand to see a grown President cry. OK, Danny, it's unanimous. We're Back. (Seriously, folks, we welcome any additional nominations for any position. Formal election will be at the December meeting.)

Rumor department: Microbotics in Richardson may be developing products for the CD32. Fact: Disctronics up here in Plano is making video CDs for the CD32 with full-motion video, using the "White Book" CD storage standard. Weird note: Compton is claiming patent rights on the concept of interactive CDs, I guess as their encyclopedia was a trend-starter. Hmmm. Diagnosis: Persons having problems connecting to the BBS at 14.4 may have his modem locked at a particular baud rate, or may have an error-correction mod e incompatibility. Tom Brooks will assist; you can visit his "AI" (Amiga/IBM or Artificial Intelligence) BBS at 272-9476 or 276-7697.

Our presentation for the month was The Edge text processor, by INOVAtronics. The product was less than 2 weeks old, but sounds promising. It only runs on 2.04 and up. RexxMast must be in your startup sequence, as it is "90% ARexx." It comes with a very small manual, but there's 300K of on-line AmigaGuide help files at your fingertips. There's a keyboard tour of built-in commands, and you can reprogram the keys for your choice of functions (using an optional user keyboard file, so you don't wipe the defaults). There is a multipledictionary capability. The Edge doesn't presently come with its own dictionary, but you can import other dictionaries, and there are some special-function ones, like a "c" language set. You can save your

Yep, we had a few door prizes: Danny Barnett brought us copies of Captain Blood and DPaint II (well, it paints - you don't HAVE to have the very latest version of something to have fun!), Kenny Teo offered Warlock, and an anonymous donor

Edge environment in different icons for different uses, like for "c" programming and newsletter writing. You can define new menu options, and record keyboard macros and even EDIT them for perfection. I liked several of the nifty editing features, like the split views. You can open multiple windows into the same piece of text, as many as you can fit on the screen. (Hey, open up 64 windows and see your text as a fly would! Novel idea...) Make a change in one window and it happens in all views as you type. Great for cutting and pasting within a document without hopping all over the place. It also let you select (for cutting, copying, etc.) text in a VERTICAL format, i.e. the 1st 20 columns on the screen, not just line-by-line or wordby-word horizontally. And for those of us who realize too late the mistake we made several minutes ago, there's a variable UNDO buffer, limited only by your memory size, to back you out sequentially of everything you've done one step at a time. Ever search for the word "oh" and find it in "John?" Edge has you covered - just tell it you're only looking for whole words, and "John" will no longer show up. Down at the bottom of the screen there was the usual line/page/column data, but there's also the ASCII value of the character you're on, and the number of changes you've made to this file. Tonight's version was "1.706", and upgrades may be coming soon as the new software tries its wings. Members were offered a substantial discount on any copies bought at the meeting. No, we couldn't have one as a door prize, but one was given away at MetCom. Normally, The Edge lists for $99.95.

## Brenda Sessums

Goede morgen, 8-bitters! You probably noticed that last month's newsletter had plenty of Metcom info and ads, but no chapter news. So this month we'll cover both October and November meetings. Now hold on tight - here we go!

At the October meeting, Jo Lynn discussed the MCCC Board of Directors' meeting and our chapter's placement at the METCOM in November. She made sure that we didn't get a closet like we did last year (and a bit cramped it was!). Jo Lynn told them we wanted to be in the middle of the room with high visibility. Also, we needed to keep our program format open to whatever those interested in 64s and 128s were interested in.

It was election time again, and nominations went basically like they did last year, with a little change in the player roster: President — Jo Lynn Lynville; Vice President — John Burt; Secretary - Brenda

The C64 and 128 are alive and well with C64 Alive - a disk magazine introduced by Phil. He said they have a special price for a club subscription. Two ways were discussed to finance the subscriptions - we could either take up a collection of a couple of dollars from chapter members, or we could use some of the booty in our club treasury. We'll probably have to put the payment method to a vote, but everyone seemed in agreement that we wanted the club membership to this lively disk magazine.

Sessums; Treasurer - John Sookma; and Librarian — Phil Heberer. (They were all elected to these offices officially at our exciting November meeting.)

## CHAPTER NEWS

If you have a modem and want to check out a great BBS, Phil said to try out Metroplex Mailbox at 2681442! It is run out of Bedford by Sysop Kyle Hearn and has SIGs for 64s as well as Amigas, PCs, Atari STs, and Macs. A great feature is FidoNet, which lets you trade information with other users world wide!

the cat) running the whole time. Our chapter's officers and club members answered a lot of questions and everyone had a great time. Programs which showed the sound and graphics capabilities of the 64s and 128s really helped draw crowds.

John Burt gave us a great demo of "Skipper Jim's Hurricane Chart", a hurricane tracking program on Disk #158. One of the sample files was Hurricane Hector. It displayed excellent graphics and wind velocity stats as the storm moved across a map of the coast and eastern seaboard. John even entered in several hurricanes of recent history, demonstrating that you could track a hurricane with latitude, longitude and wind data supplied by the National Weather Service (great for tracking future hurricanes!).

John also demonstrated several educational programs on Disk #329. He gave us a crash course in reading braille and multimeters (no, not braille multimeters!). Braille is a system of raised dots the blind use to read books and operate elevators, to name just a few uses. A multimeter has several scales that can be difficult to read — but this program clears it up and makes it a lot easier! A micrometer program helps you to use a micrometer for measuring a object's thickness. A Disk Clean Aide helped in using your disk cleaner. It comes complete with instructions.

METCOM 8-Bit News...We were in the middle of the action at this year's METCOM in Arlington. Commodore Country was behind us in this meet, literally. They had some great show specials, as did Metropolitan and some others. The MCCC flea market items were a little pricey, but on the positive side, there was never a shortage of people interested in our computer setup and demonstrations. We had two 128Ds and Brenda's Baby (the SX-64, not

Jo Lynn welcomed everyone, including five new faces (two of which joined during this meeting). Our friends out at Commodore Country told them about our club and all the FREE software you get from being a member of our chapter. Plus all the help on software and hardware problems and questions. If you are reading this, you need to be a member, too! Well, enough on the impromptu membership drive.

"Cowboys of the Silver Screen" greeted the 16 happy attendees of November's meeting. Mike Sessums was running this from the latest issue of Loadstar on his SX-64 and Brenda's "new" Texas Instruments Color Monitor. This program showed you a graphic of the film stars and then their movie stats. Some of the greats included Hoot Gibson, John Wayne, and Hopalong Cassidy.

Jo Lynn said that at the Board of Director's meeting came a suggestion to choose a new chapter name incorporating 64/128 to reflect who the club is for. New names were discussed (sort of), including "Itty Bitty 8-Bitters", "Itty 8-Bitter's Users Group", , "Micro 8 Users Group", and "Metro C64/128", to name a few. We might want to remember the Plus 4, Vic 20 and C16 users, too. Whatever name we all decide on, it should reflect that we are the only C64/128 user's group the MCCC has in the entire Central Texas area. (Oooh, that sounds important, doesn't it!)

There was a real feeding frenzy on the club library this month. Hopefully, we will be better organized for library copying at the next meeting. Also, maybe members will be understanding with those making copies for them. Some of us are a little new at the process. Boy do we miss Stephen Burt!

We got more information on the "C-64 Alive" disk-based magazine membership. Phil said that if the chapter decides on the membership, we will get two disks and a newsletter starting in January.

Phil gave us a quick rundown on area BBSs that support 64s and 128s, and how to use our computers on IBM boards, too! The SwiftLink RS232 interface lets you connect a standard 2400 Baud or higher modem to your 64 or 128. Phil said he is preparing an article on modems for the newsletter and hopefully, it will be in this issue or in the next issue of the newsletter. To save time while on the BBS of your choice, Phil said to get an off-line mail reader like Quickie (for the 64) or QWKER (for the 128). As for a modem program for the 64, he says that Novaterm 9.4 is great. It gives you 80 column text and ANSI color graphics (used on IBM boards). Whatever you need to know about equipment, BBS connections, software, terminology, and the like, Phil's your man to contact.

Commodore Country has gotten some excellent educational software for kids in the popular "Sticky Bears" series. They teach subjects like math, reading, shapes, and colors in a fun way that kids enjoy. I did talk to one 6 year-old girl that said she didn't like the Sticky Bears. I asked her why, and she said that it was hard to get past the 13th level.

Don't forget to bring sweets and goodies to share at our next meeting in December. Hopefully, the driving weather will be a sight better than Thanksgiving! If you don't know how to get to the meeting, call Jo Lynn at (817) 783-2784 or any of the other officers listed in the inside cover of this newsletter. We are trying to organize door prizes with Commodore Country for this and future meetings, so be there and maybe you'll get lucky. (The odds are much better than the lottery!)
