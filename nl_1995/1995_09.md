## Important Information

At the August Board of Directors Meeting, the decision was made to produce the full MCCC News only on alternate months. This is a cost-cutting measure adopted to adjust to the realities of our new, smaller membership. (We have lost approximately 100 members in the past year.) With Amigas once again being sold, the hope is that our membership will once again grow to a more reasonable size. When that begins to happen, and as soon as possible, we will return to a full monthly newsletter. In the meantime, you will be seeing this MCCC Connection on alternate months with just the most important information printed
