## The Amiga

a tale of two computers — part i by Rick Bilonick - Pittsburgh Commodore Group

O ne might think that a practicing statistician would only be interested in the computing power of a computer. However, the first computer that I developed an emotional relationship with was the venerable Commodore 64, and what most interested me was the ability to use it to control and monitor various external devices (like model railroads). Only slightly later did I appreciate the C-64's graphical abilities. Compared to the C-64, the original IBM PC paled, literally. (Back then, color and sound were thought by many to be unimportant.) The C-64's graphics system is tightly integrated into the computer. The IBM PC (and its sundry clones) still today have a very loosely integrated graphics sub-system — and many of them! (Try installing IBM's OS/2 operating system and count the drivers.)

Apple Computer took a more integrated approach to graphics, to the point of building the (tiny, monochrome) monitor into the computer. (That way, EVERYBODY has to buy their monitor from Apple. Although they overlooked the money that could be made when buyers wanted to upgrade to better monitors.)

As in most things, computer graphics tends to be a trade off between ability and cost. More graphical power costs more money. The key is to get off the curve! Find a computer that provides significantly better graphics without the higher price tag. (It's like building cars. ANYONE can build a great car for $50,000. Nobody deserves a medal for this. It takes an exceptional company to produce a great car for $10,000.)

By the mid-1980's, the emphasis on personal computer graphics was well underway. The Apple Macintosh is introduced. About a year later, Commodore introduces the Amiga. (Commodore purchased the company that designed the Amiga. I will leave it to future historians to decide the question as to the positive or negative impact this ultimately would have on the Amiga. After all, the only other company that was interested in the Amiga technology was Atari. Had neither company been interested, there might not have been an Amiga computer.)

From the beginning, the Amiga offered exceptional graphics at an affordable price, especially when compared to the Mac. It also had a pre-emptive multitasking operating system. (Does the Mac have one yet?) In fact, the Amiga's operating system has no peers even among much more expensive (non-Unix based) systems. Running OS/2 Warp on an IBM 486 still leaves a lot to be desired, although it is about as close as you can get the Amiga's OS. It is just not as smooth. (Although part of the problem no doubt stems from having to handle 16-bit programs trying to run in a 32-bit OS.)

But, at least you CAN get significantly better performance by spending somewhat more money.

With the demise of Commodore in April of 1994, those wishing to move to another platform which was truly superior to the Amiga and affordable too would be disappointed. Even today, you still must spend considerably more to get a significantly better system.

At present, the Amiga 4000 is the most sophisticated Amiga available (part of a computer line originating from 1986). (With the ESCOM purchase of all Commodore assets, hopefully a RISC-based Amiga will appear. If new Amiga 1200's and 4000's appear in the next 3 to 4 months, perhaps a RISC-based Amiga will see the light of day.) The Amiga 4000 was available with either a Motorola 68030 (25mhz) or 68040 (25mhz) CPU (central processing unit) (the 68040 has a built-in floating-point co-processor), ordinarily 6 mb of memory (2mb chip / 4mb fast) and 120 mb IDE hard drive. A stock 68040 Amiga (6mb memory, 120 mb hard drive, one floppy) was selling for around $2,000 to $2,500 ($2,500 to $3,000 with multisync monitor). At least one additional IDE hard drive can be fitted internally. Various SCSI and SCSI II controllers are available. It has 4 Zorro III slots (one of which is in

Dallas line with the video slot). Also included was one highdensity (2mb unformatted) floppy drive (it has room for two internally and included an external floppy port for two additional floppies). The stock Amiga 4000 can't directly output a NTSC or PAL video signal. However, video encoders range from a $20-30 composite encoder up through S-video, high-end genlocks and video boards (like NewTek's celebrated Video Toaster). (Although the Amiga 1200 has no Zorro III slots, it does have a built-in composite encoder in addition to a standard RGB video port [15-31khz] and television RF port.)

The 4000 (along with the 1200 and and CD-32) use the "advanced graphics architecture" (AGA) graphics system. This allows one to easily select any video signal from 15 to 31khz and provides the Amiga with an amazing range of video modes from NTSC and PAL television to VGA-like high resolution displays. The AGA chipset is tightly integrated into the rest of the Amiga on its motherboard. The maximum resolution with AGA is around 720 x 460 non-interlaced 31khz (928 x 600 interlaced 31khz). (Many other modes are available including 1200 x 400 15khz.) The AGA chipset can display from 2 to 256 colors (out of a 24-bit 16 million color palette) simultaneously in all possible screen resolutions. It also can display 256,000 color screens in HAM8 mode which displays photographs and rendered images (including animations) very nicely. Additionally, it can display numerous screens in various resolutions with separate 256 color (or HAM8) palettes simultaneously. (In contrast, the PC's SVGA can display 256 colors out of a 256,000 color palette.) Although other display boards can be fitted into the Zorro Ill or video slots to replace or complement the AGA chipset, these boards are not as tightly integrated into the system. Finally, software that runs on one Amiga model runs on all the others (assuming it is correctly written).

The Indy represents the low-end of the Silicon Graphics computer line, a line that includes at the top-end super computers. This "low-end" computer comes in various configurations, but a minimum usable system would include a 100mhz MIPS 4600 cpu (a RISC processor), 32mb of memory and 500mb SCSI II hard drive. All models also include the following: room for an additional internal 3.5 inch SCSI device (hard drive of floptical drive), an external SCSI Il port, ethernet port (AUl and 10-Base T — only one of which may be connected), ISDN port (high-speed serial connection, especially useful for now-available digital telephone lines), two RS-232/422 serial ports, one bi-directional parallel port, three video-in ports (NTSC/PAL composite, S-video, and digital video), five audio ports (including stereo headphones, stereo microphones, digital input/output). Also included is a port for stereo glasses. Two GIGO slots are available for video encoder boards, and additional ethernet and SCSI II controllers. A 1280 x 1024 noninterlaced monitor (capable of supporting stereo glasses) is included, along with a digital video camera (IndyCam) and electret microphone. The cost of this minimum usable system has a list price of around $6,500. If you don't plan to connect to a network either by ethernet or ISDN, then you almost have to get a floptical drive (capable of reading 2mb (unformatted) PC/MAC floppies and 21mb (unformatted) floptical disks. Add $500. Various discounts are available to educational institutions and students, and (large) companies but may be difficult to come by for individuals. The basic system described above assumes an 8-bit graphic sub-system. Although the Indy's graphic sub-system is tightly integrated and optimized for performance, it can be easily replaced with either a 24-bit graphics sub-system (add $3,000 or more) or the ultra high-end XZ graphic sub-system (don't even ask). Although the Indy's low end graphics system is only 8-bit, it has multiple palettes. I assume this means that separate windows have their own independent 8-bit palettes. Finally, the Indy is binary-compatible with Silicon Graphics' (SGI's) entire line of computers. This means that the same software runs on all SGI computers.

With this background, let's compare and contrast the Commodore Amiga 4000 and Silicon Graphics' Indy, and the companies behind them.

One thing both machines share in common is that few people (in the general public) were/are familiar with Commodore/Silicon Graphics. This tends to be true even among users of computers. Both companies served/serve niche markets. Commodore, through the Amiga line, catered to lower end television and video professionals and computer hobbyists. ("Lower-end" here is not meant in pejorative sense. It only refers to more budget-minded, often self-employed professionals. The graphics produced have often rivaled if not surpassed other platforms.) Silicon Graphics has concentrated on the higher-end movies/television/video, CAD and super computing markets.

When the Indy was first introduced (1993?), it seemed aimed directly at the Amiga's niche market (at least to some Amiga users). However, it quickly became clear that there was not as much overlap as thought at first. Although the Indy is clearly much more powerful in every way, it costs significantly more.

The Amiga in its niche market had made considerable progress in attracting television producers to use the Amiga (often with Video Toasters) to produce high-quality computer-generated animation. It has been used in high-profile projects like Babylon 5, SeaQuest DSV and RoboCop. It has also been used in countless other weekly television shows and many movies.

The Indy is being used in the production of television shows and movies. Animation techniques were pioneered on related SGI computers (Indigos, Crimsons, Onyxes) in movies such as Terminator Il and Jurassic Park. Indys are also used for desktop publishing and CAD work. In addition, SGI is promoting the Indy for World Wide Web authoring.

## DeluxePaint V

a quick rundown of the new features

Bill Gadzia, The Metro Amiga Computer Resource of Phoenix, Arizona his is least original of ANY article I've ever done for MACRO. But the Board sandbagged me by getting me to agree to do a demo fo the newest update to an Amiga standard, Deluxe Paint. THEN they suggested that an accompanying article for the newsletter would be timely. Thus, most of this article is copied from the DPaint V manual. At the meeting, Ill give a quick peek at as many of the features as I can learn in the next couple of weeks.

The latest version of DPaint is V (I think that's five, but that's mostly based on the fact that my previous version was four). Its release was a pleasant surprise since Electronic Arts had stated that they would no longer support DPaint with further upgrades.

Here's a list of the major enhancements and updates in the software:

- True Color Support: Deluxe Paint V supports. 24-bit color data through the use of a 24-bit backing store. You can now load, edit and save 24-bit IFF data.
- ARexx Support: The popular interprocess scripting/communications language ARexx is supported. ARexx can be used to control programs internally and externally on the Amiga as well as provide recordable macro functionalities to DPaint.
- Natural Media: Natural Media Types and Textured Background modes enable emulation of stylistic painting modes/effects such as water color, oils, and chalk. The ability to paint on textured backgrounds also enhances the natural feeling of painting and drawing
- Improved Airbrush: The Airbrush now offers realistic spray with adjustable radius settings.
- Loading Anims Different Sizes: Load any size Anim, including virtual pages. Create and edit larger than screen animations.
- Camera Moves: This new feature allows scrolling backgrounds and zoom-in and zoom-out type moves.
- Improved Gradient/Translucency Control: Userdefined controls for gradient translucency. New — an improved gradient dithering in all modes (Smooth, Adjustable Pattern, and Adjustable Random type gradient fills.)
- LightTable Enhancements: Different dimming options for LightTable. Multiple levels of dimming for LightTable settings (Layers, Dim levels).
- Individual Palettes per Frame: You can now create, edit, load, and save multiple palette animations.
- Animation Fade/Translucency Options: From within the Move Requester you can specify a beginning and ending level of translucency for the custom brush or animbrush being moved.
- Animations Rate Changes per Frame: Set the animation frame rate or pause on a per frame basis if so desired.
- Key Frame Animation: Using the Move Requester, the user will be able to interactively position their brush or animbrush on start and end key frames in their animation.
- Pressure Sensitive Tablet Support: Cycle pressure, size, translucency, and reverse size settings. Requires a supported pressure sensitive tablet.
- Corral Brush Pickup: A new brush pickup mode much like the freehand drawing tool.
- Seed-Fill Pickup: This "magic wand" tool allows you to pick up a custom brush from the screen by simply clicking on the object.
- Improved File Format Support: Support for Anim Op8 format.
- Improved Speed: Code optimization has increased the speed of some functions in the program.
- Enhanced Interface: Standard Amiga keyboard commands for applications, localization, and better user definable preferences for most program settings.
- Enhanced Printing Options: Storyboard printing Animboard (tm) allows you to print a storyboard of your animation. Expanded printing control and support for system printer preferences have been added.
- Picture Previews: You can now view and save a picture preview in the file or file icon. The file's icon will also be an image preview.
- New Player, DeluxePlayer: DeluxePlayer provides support for ARexx and multiple palette anims, and the ability to play anims from your hard drive.
- Mouse/Table Tracking: Tracking and smoothing for better looking freehand drawing. Mouse/tablet movements are buffered and smoothed.
- Color Panel Enhancements: You now have the option to turn on and off the grid around the color cells to do side-by-side color comparisons. RGB and HSV sliders are shown simultaneously. Also included are Color Cell extended selections, true RGB color cells (no longer HAM), a standardized design and look for all color panels, and a larger and enhanced mixing area.
- Status Gauge: Status gauges provide visual feedback on the progress of many DPaint operations.
- Animation Rate Status: If your computer system cannot maintain the specified animation rate, you can call up a speedometer while the animation is running. The speedometer will visually provide you with the estimated animation rate.

## Multi-Serialism

## a tale of two serial cards

Mike Latinovich — The Champaign-Urbana Commodore Users Group hat I thought was a serial card problem turns Everything seems to be fixed now. I'm happy to say though, that in my quest to solve the problem, Ive picked up a second serial card, a BSC/Alfa Data MultiFaceCard III (FGC3). This is a pretty nice board! It's VERY comparable to the GVP ioExtender (the older ones with the 2 serial ports), and has pretty much everything the GVP card does. Here's how they stand.

## GVP's ioExtender (old ioExtender)

2 VERY high speed serial ports, with 16-byte FIFO (First In, First Out) buffers on each port. This gives a theoretical maximum throughput of around 64,400 bitsper-second per port (at least according to their software and literature). I have only personally locked the ports at 115,200 bps with my 2 US Robotics v32 turbo modems, as they are the only modems available to me that can lock at a rate that high. I have heard that it will run with 2 of the new Hayes v.FC modems with locked port rates of 230,400 bps, but I can't actually say I've seen it.

The GVP card also has a standard 25-pin parallel port that supposedly supports all of the bi-directional functions that the internal Amiga parallel port does. (I have no way of testing the port, as I have no printer, nor another machine to ParNet with.) [Editor's note: The parallel port works quite well on my computer. I have my printer hooked up to it. Everything that would normally be sent to the Amiga's internal port is automatically sent to the GVP port instead. It is totally transparent and bug free. In the meantime, I can use my built-in parallel port for my scanner. Bill!

Also included is a MIDI port, for GVP's "Midi Expansion Unit." Alas, GVP ever released this product, and have ticked off a whole slew of ioExtender owners.

The 44-page manual is quite complete in its description of how to install the board in a variety of systems, mainly the A2000 and A3000. I had no problems adapting the A3000 installation instructions to my Amiga 4000, and the card worked flawlessly after installation.

The ioExtender requires that you install a device driver to be able to use the board once it is installed in your system. GVP provides this software on one disk, and everything is a snap to install because GVP chose to use Commodore's standard Installer program to take care of everything. The software includes two "Prefs"-style programs which allow you to configure the board without having to mess with any hardware jumpers. One of the Prefs programs allows you to re direct input/output functions of your Amiga's built-in serial &amp; parallel ports to any of the ioExtender's ports.

Overall, this is a very good product if you need the high-speed multi-serial abilities like I do when running a multi-line BBS. It is a product I would, and will, recommend to people looking for such an item.

## BSC/Alfa Data's MultiFaceCard III (MFC3)

Again, 2 high-speed serial ports that I would assume also have FIFO buffering, but I haven't been able to find much technical information available about this board yet. The manual states that this board will allow up to a maximum of 115,200 bps per port and, again, I have verified this with my modems. This board seems to take up less of the CPU while operating at high speeds than the GVP board does. This may be attributed to the board using on-board processors to move the data rather than using buffers like the GVP card does. However, I cannot verify whether this is the case or not, since I'm no engineer, and I have no idea what all those little numbers on the chips mean.

The MFC3 also has one 25-pin parallel port on board, and it is of the bi-directional nature also. The manual and installation software state that the ports on the MFC3 can be used for "ParNetting" two Amiga together and, again, I cannot verify this because of the lack of printer or other Amigas. The manual also states that you can add a second parallel port to the card if needed, but doesn't really go into detail of how or where to purchase this add-on. (I would assume you could get it through Alfa Data here in the USA.)

The manual is quite nice. Almost 200 pages in length, it covers the installation of the board and the software in both English (92 pages) and German (95 pages). The manual describes how to install a variety of BSC's cards (all the MultiFace series boards) into various different Amigas. It also includes pinout references for all the ports on board, which is something GVP neglected to do. The manual seems to be a very complete and accurate source of information considering this product was created for an overseas market (UK &amp; Germany). BSC includes a disk that also has a very complete installation package provided through the Commodore Installer. I had no problems installing the board or the software onto my machine, and it has worked 100% flawlessly since installed. The installation script also provides for removing the installed programs, which is a very nice provision for the software.

The manual has some blurb about not being able to handle MIDI data rates, so I don't think this card has the MIDI capabilities (?) of the GVP board.

Overall, a very professional package, which would suit the needs of any BBS SysOps that I know. I would also recommend this fine piece of hardware to anyone that · Page 5

## Virus Checker by John Veldthuis

This is version 6.56 of the most popular virus protection utility around. That should be about all I need to say. Stay current. Get it. It's on MCCC-A 910.

## TolleUhr by Matthias Fleischer and Gunther Nikl

TolleUhr is the best looking analogue clock I have seen. It looks the way a clock should look on an Amiga it's just that no-one else has bothered to do one like it. There are lots of options. You get your choice of position, size, style of hands, colors, and lots more. This is version 1.3. Check it out. You'll find it this month on MCCCA 912.

## Diamond Caves by Peter Elzner

This is the third month in a row that I've written about Diamond Caves. This month's version is 2.1. There's also an accompanying level editor, preferences editor and sound effects editor. If you haven't played, try it. If you're playing already, be sure to get the upgrade. It remains the best "Boulder Dash" game you'll find. It's available (in archived format) on disk MCCC-A \_913 this month.

needed its abilities. It would be their place to decide between the GVP or the BSC/Alfa Data board.

Both of the boards have a similar price. I paid $119 for the GVP board at my local dealer (Micro Resales; when they supported the Amiga), and I paid $95 for the BSC board from a local Amiga mail order firm (Select Solutions). Both are very good buys for what they provide!

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga North Dallas

Michael Turner he had received the newest copy of Amiga Game Zone, which was rumored to be defunct. Another rumor bites the dust!

We had about around twelve members who made their way through some really nasty weather to show up for our July meeting at the Richardson Civic Center. We started just a little later than our normal time of 7:30 to allow for any last minute stragglers coming in from the storm. Eddie started off the meeting with a discussion of any news or rumors that were floating around.

Of course, with the recent buyout of Commodore by Escom, there were lots of things to talk about. Several people brought up the rumor of Escom starting up production of A2000s immediately for sale in China using a Chinese factory for production, but Steve mentioned that he had'read somewhere that that particular deal had fallen through. Tom Brooks had heard through his vast resources that another possibility was the production of an "A1400" which would be an "A1200" outfitted with a CD-ROM drive for production in Europe. Apparantly, Escom is keeping the Amiga division of their company separate from their other enterprises and it is going to be run as a separate entity. Keep in mind, however, that these are just rumors. Nobody has actually seen any of this stuff yet. Steve, Eddie and Tom all mentioned also that no-one has heard anything at all about possible AAA new architecture releases. Eddie also brought the newest copy of CU Amiga, a British Amiga magazine, which contained their report of Escom's purchase of Commodore. Since we were all talking about magazines anyway, one member mentioned that

Sysop Tom Brooks mentioned that he had downloaded the new Escom logo and also a new Dynablaster clone for all you "gamers" out there — and also that he was in need of another Amiga monitor. Danny Barnett managed to pick up an extra keyboard that he needed from another member, but poor Tom was still in need when we. left. Anyone got a spare monitor lying around? Give Tom's board, "A.I." , a ring. His board carries Fidonet with 113 echoes and Dalnet, which carries almost all Amiga stuff. A.I.'s number is 272-9476. Tom's even got a 33600 bps line at 2767697. Tom also mentioned that he is in need of a "twit" filter for C-net. For anyone who might not know, a "twit" filter is used to keep a caller who just absolutely refuses to behave from using the BBS! Oh, the trials of a Sysop!

From the subject of rude people on BBS's we moved to the subject of off-line readers and editors. What is an off-line reader you might well ask? An off-line reader lets you download all your E-mail and upload all your replies to different people at once and lets the BBS or net-site take care of sorting it out. Pretty neat stuff, huh?! Danny Barnett talked about several problems he's had with Q-Blue both downloading and uploading.

Finally, we moved on to our presentation. Our presenter was our own Mike Paschetag and Mike took us "surfing on the Net!" Almost everyone has heard of the Internet by now, but many people (including some of our members) did not know what it was. Mike patiently explained what the "Net" was and what was going on the Internet right now. Our presenter also explained about the World Wide Webb and how to use it. The Internet is expanding exponentially and the biggest part of this expansion is the World Wide Webb. Mike explained how "hypertext" and HTML programming works. After a few unsuccessful connections (there was a storm outside), Mike demonstrated the concepts of "Home pages" and demonstrated all the capabilities of AMosaic, the Amiga Webb browser. He also outlined what software and hardware would be required for any would-be Amiga Webb user. AMTDCP, hypertext, MUD's, IRC... Mike went into it all. He even gave yours truly advice on what I would need to browse the Webb. Mike's demonstration showed just how vast the Internet really is. Thanks, Mike!

Our next meeting will be at the Richardson Civic Center on the third Tuesday in August. Our August
