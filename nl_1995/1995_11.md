A Publication of the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club November 1995

## Amiga News!

Here is the latest from Amiga Technologies GmbH. The ship-date for the new Amiga 4000 Tower utilizing the 68040 processor has been moved back to late October. I'm getting contradictory stories about the configuration it will have. Trust me, there really is an A-4000T coming out. It has been confirmed by suppliers. The raw parts of the A-4000T have been shipped and production is going at a swift but sure pace. There is also talk of a 68060/50Mhz version of the A-4000T due out in November which will depend on talks with the Cyberstorm folks. Talk is that the 68060 is faster than the Pentium 100 by 30%. There is also a new multisync stereo monitor with a 15 to 38 Khz horizontal scan rate that AT/ESCOM is making, the M1438S monitor.

Remember all the bad news of the last couple of months: about the high $3,500 price tag of A-4000T's and the lack of advertising, A-1200's and CD32's for the North American market? You've no doubt heard about the old behavior of ex-Commodore council, Ed Goff and distributor Alex Amor of CEl? This has been very frustrating as we wait impatiently for the release of new Amigas.

I have talked with our local Amiga dealer, Dan Sorenson of Clackamas Computers. He has told me that CEl is not the only distributor for the A-4000T. There are three other Amiga distributors as well. This is great news as Clackamas Computers can shop around for the best deal for you. He's been hearing prices more in the $2,700 range. Mr. Sorenson told me not to believe the stories of no Amiga 1200s and CD32's for North America either. If you want them, they can order them for you.

Rumor has it that the majority of A-4000T's have already been sold. Production was based on pre-purchased A4000T's by the distributors. That could explain why the original price tag was so high. Naturally the ramp-up cost is brought into the price as well but I've heard that the professional video market is screaming for A4000T's. They are quite content to pay whatever it takes to get an Amiga. The alternative to the Amiga is what can be done on more expensive and slower machines.

There had been a lot of talk of NewTek abandoning the Amiga. These rumors are false. Although NewTek has been producing Video Toasters (and their new Toaster Flyers) for other computer platforms, Mr. Sorenson assures me that NewTek still loves the Amiga. With production starting up again for the A-4000, that gives NewTek even more incentive to stick by the Amiga. ...Rick Rudge, MC3

## A BBS Find

I'd like to let you all in on a GREAT deal. I found a BBS, about 6 months ago, which 1 joined almost immediately. I've been BBSing for 10 years now, and NEVER have 1 found a more helpful, or knowledgeable sysop. He runs numerous platforms himself, and when I had trouble with his mail, he set it all up, just for me, in the hopes that other Commodore users would stumble in, and find a home as well. This was, and is, my hope. He added the comp.sys.com internet usegroup for me, and already has all of the Fido CBM conferences online. The greatest thing about this BBS, (Contrails is the name of it, by the way), is that the sysop has just added FULL Internet access. The board is connected to the World Wide Web, IS and ftp site, has a unix line, has gopher, whois, finger, and telnet. Lynx is NOT an option on the main board, but is accessible on the unix line, or by telenetting to another www site which incorporates lynx, such as http://www.law.cornell.edu. For the sake of those who DON'T like a Cam mail door, and use a platform which doesn't support PKZip2.04g, he has incorporated PKZip1.x into his main mail door, which is a new door contained within PBoard 1.5.

Last, and best of all, the price is the lowest I've ever seen. FULL access for 1 year is $49.95. There is a 6 month account as well, or a "file only" account. But from what I've seen and heard, most folks spend more than $50 for just 3 months of internet access on boards which are NOT Commodore friendly.

The name of this BBS, again, is Contrails, Sysop: Joe Richter. The access #'s are:

Customer support, technical line: 817-545-2599

Ft. Worth Metro lines: (817) 355-9242 (28.8), (817) 355-9252 (28.8)

Ft. Worth lines (all are running at 14.4, and in area code (817): 545-0152, 545-1539, 571-3424, 571-0651, and 571-0958.

Unix line: (817) 571-0878

This BBS has been in service since 1991, and basically serves all of the American Airlines employees, but is open to the general public. It should be around for some time to come. Online chat, games, and IBM file sections are also available. I have not asked for a Commodore file section, as there are not that many Commodore users online yet to use it, and with ftp access, it's not really necessary. There are over 1600 different mail areas on the bbs, and upon request, Joe, the sysop, will put up any you desire, if he doesn't already have them.

I hope to see many of you online, checking this place out. I love it, and you will too! ....Kathy Cole, MCCC
