## Surfin' the Nets

## bruce's trek on the internet by Bruce Nelson

uring the 1994 Christmas holidays, I decided to Died mi is grates restates sounded Mosaic with its graphical presentations sounded exciting. But would I be able to surf with the orphaned Amiga and at a cost that I could afford (I'm known as a penny pincher)? The answer is a definite YES and it was done on an A2Q00HD with AmigaDOS 2.1 running Term 4.2 terminal access program with a Supra 14.4kB FAX modem. I will attempt to share some of my experiences with you.

I'm literate, so I set out for the local Barnes &amp; Noble book store to find just the right book to guide me to the Internet. The computer section absolutely overwhelmed me with its many choices. I spent considerable time flipping through each book. Eventually the book of choice was The Internet Navigator (The Essential Guide to Network Exploration for the Individual Dial-up User), Second Edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.), by Paul Gilster. The nearly 600 pages make it a comprehensive guide to the Internet. You should buy it ($24.95) and read it. I

The next step taken was to locate a low-cost, entrylevel Internet provider: a BBS. A very popular North Texas BBS with an Internet port is Chrysalis, operated in Plano with both Dallas and Fort Worth telephone lines (some 64 of them with plans to expand to 96). Fort Worth # is 817-540-5565. For a one-time $10 fee, sysop Garry Grosse will establish for you a permanent Internet address with unlimited E-mail privileges. My Internet address at this BBS is &lt;Bruce.NelsonChrysalis.Org&gt;. I went with Chrysalis' Platinum package at $50/year: unlimited logins, unlimited time and unlimited downloads.

My IP (Internet Protocol) address prefix is &lt;Bruce.Nelson&gt;. My IP address suffix or Internet Domain is &lt;Chrysalis.Org&gt;. Internet domain names tell much about addresses:

| com U.S. commercial mcimail.com MCI E-mail   |          |                             |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| edu U.S. education                           | tamu.edu | Texas A&M                   |
| gov U.S. Government texas.gov                |          | Texas capital-Austin        |
| mil U.S. military                            | ddn.mil  | Defense Data Net            |
| net Network Admin. dfw.net                   |          | DFW Net Services            |
| org Organizations                            |          | chrysalis.org Chrysalis BBS |

Also .de is Germany, ch Switzerland, uk United Kingdom, it Italy, etc.

Chrysalis BBS does not provide a direct link (i.e., shell account) to the Internet. It provides an indirect route to the Internet via E-mail gateway. I use E-mail to keep in touch with my out-of-state family and with a nephew, a student with Internet access at Iowa State University. A coworker writes his out-of-town dad every day with E-mail.

You can retrieve files on other computers using the E-mail program FTPmail (File Transfer Protocol via Email). The body of the message should contain the file information needed by the remote computer that will process your request. A typical message might look like:

reply bruce.nelsonchrysalis.org connect wustu.edu chdir /pub/amiga unencode get amiga.pgm.lha quit

Chrysalis has a list of six FTPmail servers from which to choose. The mail server will process your request and then pass it on to the FTP computer site. This site, &lt;wustu.edu›, will change the directory to &lt;/pub/amiga&gt; and then will create a message with the unencoded file &lt;amiga.pgm.lha&gt;. You should receive a reply within a few days, or perhaps weeks. FTPmail, as I have experienced it, is SSSLLLOOOWWW!!! When you receive the message, you should download it to your Amiga where you

Dallas will uudecode it with UUxT. You will find UUxT as MCCC BBS file &lt;UUxT30B.Iha&gt;. Uuencode/uudecode is the unix-to-unix encode/decode process that converts files to ASCII for the transfer to you. Note that your mail may be handed off from one machine to another many times on its way to you and only ASCII can survive intact.

You may find that downloaded E-mail messages are difficult to read and may not print appropriately. Get The File Converter 2.2 &lt;FILECONV.Izh&gt; from MCCC BBS and use it to delete or replace line feeds and carriage returns, as needed.

On Chrysalis I have joined the newsgroup *amiga*. Each (and every day, lest I be overwhelmed) this newsgroup is downloaded to my Amiga where it is read via my registered offline reader, AmiQWK &lt;AmiQWK27.Iha&gt;. Several hundred Fidonet messages are downloaded daily. The message titles are scanned via INDEX mode of AmiQWK and only those messages that are of interest to me are actually read.

As you can see, the Chrysalis BBS performs well as an Internet E-mail server but does not allow for direct connection to other computer sites via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or TELNET (terminal session to another computer). It also does not provide a gateway to run client apps such as Amosaic (Amiga version of the graphical World Wide Web browser Mosaic) and Grapevine (Amiga version of IRC-Internet Relay Chat). To do this, one needs to lease an account with an Internet provider.

An Internet provider account may be: shell ($18/month); SLIP ($40/month + setup fee); or direct (don't even ask how much). With a shell account, your Amiga acts as a terminal and the Internet software runs at the provider's UNIX host computer. With a SLIP (Serial Line/Internet Protocol) account, the Internet provider becomes a gateway and your Amiga is a node on the Internet and as a node it runs client software such as Amosaic, Grapevine and AmiTCP utilities such as NCFTP. You must have a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) stack capable of SLIP, e.g., AmiTCP. With a direct account one has a dedicated SLIP rather than a dial-up SLIP.

There are many Internet providers in the Fort Worth-Dallas area including On-Ramp, DFW Internet Services, Netcom and Texas Metronet. Each of these providers allow for guest (free trial) accounts.

I chose to go with a 6-month pre-paid shell account with DFW Internet Services ($93). Fort Worth # is 817332-6642. My E-mail address here is &lt;bjnelsondfw.net&gt;. It is with this shell account that I have the most fun on the Net. With TELNET I can establish a terminal session to another computer. With FTP I can connect to FTP sites as ANONYMOUS user to transfer files back to my provider, DFWnet. These files can then be downloaded to my Amiga via the UNIX sz (send Zmodem) command. It is important that you note that files transferred via FTPmail takes days, sometimes weeks, but only minutes via FTP on a shell account.

DF Wnet provides a VT100 terminal-based WWW browser named Lynx. With it I have surfed the Net including the Louvre Museum in France where I fetched jpeg graphic files of impressionist works of art by Monet and Picasso. Impressed? My daughter, the art critic, was.

But yet, I still had not surfed with the touted Mosaic. And what to do since it required a SLIP account at twice the cost of my shell account? The answer is The Internet Adaptor (TIA). It turns a shell connection into a SLIP connection. A single-user license costs only $25. WOW! Send a blank E-mail message to &lt;tia-portinfomarketplace.com &gt; where a mailbot (D-mail processing robot) will respond with information on TIA.

It is here that I downloaded from MCCC BBS the apps necessary to surf the net:

Mosaic12.Iha

Amosaic 1.2 for use with AmiTCP

Amosaic\_shunt.lha

Amosaic wedge

MUI23USR.Iha

Magic User Interface 2.3

Grapevine.lha

IRC (Internet Relay Chat)

AmiTCP-demo-40.lha AmiTCP version 4.0 demo

Installation was straightforward except for some IP address information that I did not yet have for AmiTCP (Amiga TCP/IP stack). There is no registration for Amosaic. I have sent in my registration for MUI and Grapevine. It was disappointing to see the unusually high registration fee ($100+) for AmiTCP.

I installed TIA (be sure to get the one specific for your provider's OS, e.g., Sparc/SunOS for DFWnet) in my shell account at DFWnet. Ran it with the &lt;-address› parm to get the gateway and nameserver IP addresses. Next, I installed AmiTCP on my Amiga. This installation was, for me, the biggest challenge. For DFWnet of Fort Worth, you may use the following in installing AmiTCP...

| 198.175.15.10   | Gateway    |
|-----------------|------------|
| 255.255.255.0   | NetMask    |
| 198.175.15.10   | Nameserver |
| 165.90.2.2      | Nameserver |

## HERE'S HOW I SURF THE INTERNET...

Start the terminal program. Tell the modem to ignore the hangup with the command &lt;AT &amp;D&gt;. Dial-up and login in to the Internet provider. Run TIA (the shell changes to SLIP). Exit terminal program. Execute AmiTCP's script ‹startnet &gt; in an Amiga shell without an IP address parm (TIA takes care of this). Start Amosaic. Surfs up!

Where does one go and what does one do with Mosaic? I recommend yet another book by Paul Gilster: The Mosaic Navigater (The Essential Guide to the Internet Interface). $16.95. Get it. Read it.

## Beginner's Corner

using amiga workbench 2.0+ menus by Mike Sessums

L ife is much easier when you learn how to use your , pull-down menus. In this quick lesson, get ready to pull down your menus and see what we can find There are four pull-down menu types on the basic 2.0 and higher Workbench: Workbench, Window, Icons, and Tools. To see these appear in the bar across the top of the Workbench 2.0 window, press and hold your right mouse button. There they are!

Now, if you move your mouse pointer up to the menu bar, you will see a set of menu items for each menu. First, let's look at the Workbench menus items: Backdrop, Execute Command, Redraw All, Update All, Last Message, About, and Quit. Any item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over the item name (with the right mouse button still depressed) and then releasing the button. "Backdrop" turns your window border on or off. "Execute Command" brings up a command line window where you can type in a command you want the Amiga to carry out. If you have a program called VT in your C directory, you might be able to execute (run) the program by typing VT, and then click on OK or press return. (We talked more about using the CLI in last month's newsletter.) "Last Message" repeats the last message which was printed across the menu bar. If you just ran the program above, the message might be "Attempting to load 'VT'... "About" tells you information about what version of Kickstart and Workbench you are using. This is handy if you need to give a problem report to your authorized Commodore repairman (Commodore Country has one!) or if someone just wants to know what version you are using. "Quit" lets you quit from Workbench if you don't have any programs running. However, once you quit you can't do anything else with your Amiga without rebooting your machine. The best advice is just don't use "Quit"! I haven't found a practical use for this option yet.

Now on to the "Window" items. "Select Contents" "Clean Up", and "Snapshot" are the only items that work without having a directory or disk icon open. "New Drawer" lets you create a new drawer and give it a name. "Open Parent" will open the "parent" (main) directory if you are in a child (sub) directory. "Close" will close the directory you currently have open. "Update" will update a directory if you have made changes to it. This is good if you've added new files to a directory and want to see that they are there (use this with "Show" and "View By" discussed later). "Select Contents" will select the entire contents of your current window (directory). You can tell what your current window is because the frame will have a different color or highlight from the other windows displayed. "Clean Up" organizes your icons close together. This is handy if you just added a few icons and were a little messy doing it. "Snapshot" has submenus called

"Window" and "All". Select "Snapshot: Window" to keep the window in its current location when you open it next time. Select "Snapshot: All" to do the same as "Snapshot: Window", but also to keep all the window contents displayed where you currently have them. "Show" , and "View By" are real nifty items, and something that I use the most. "Show" has two submenu items: "Only Icons" and "All Files". "View By" has four: "Icon", "Name" "Date", and "Size". The default is "Show: Only Icons", "View by: Icons". The most helpful combination I have found is "Show: All Files", and "View: By Name". This combination will show you all those hidden files on a disk or in a directory. A hidden file is a file which doesn't have an icon (.info file) attached to it and doesn't show up when you open a window. Programs such as SID and Directory OPUS can give you similar information, but at a price. (Of course, you can do even more than list files with these programs.) The first is shareware, and the second is commercial.

"Tools", , the final pull-down menu, only has one menu item: "ResetWB". You can select this after running a program that was a memory hog and it will help reset or "free up" any memory no longer being used. At least, that's what it should do! → Page 4

Finally, we get to the "Icons" menu items: "Open", "Copy", "Rename", "Information" , "Snapshot" "Unsnapshot", "Leave Out", "Put Away", ", "Delete", "Format Disk", and "Empty Trash". Wow, that's a mouth full! "Open" will open a disk or directory after you single click the left mouse button on its icon, and then select "Icons: Open". (It is faster just to double click the left button!) "Copy" will make a file copy by selecting the file to copy, and then selecting "Icon:Copy". The result will be a copy of the file named Copy \_of \_filename" where "filename" is the name of the file you just copied. "Rename" lets you rename a file by clicking on the file, selecting "Icon:Rename", and typing in the new file name. This comes in very handy when you use the "Copy" command above. "Information" shows a file's details including the project name (filename), size of file in bytes, default tool used to execute the file, and what protections are set: script, archived, readable, writable, executable, and deletable. First, select the file with a single left mouse click, then select "Icon: Information". "Information" is real handy when you can't get a file to execute because you either don't have the default tool it wants, or you don't have the tool in the directory which it is searching. Let's say you want to view a text file which has a default tool of "AmigaGuide", , which you don't have. You simply replace "AmigaGuide" with a text reader you do have, such as "View80", as the default tool. The next time you select that file, it will automatically be loaded by "View 80"!

## Confused?

## you're not the only one from the Milwauke Community Computer Club

Dalton ell Computer Corp. techs relate tales of help-line One said she couldn't get her new computer to turn on. After asking if it was plugged in, the tech asked what happens when she pushes the power button. "I've pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens." "What foot pedal?" Her reply: "This little white foot pedal with the on switch." It turns out that the "foot pedal" was the computer's mouse.

Techs are finding that novices are purchasing computers and expecting miracles immediately.

One woman called to ask how to install batteries in her laptop. When told that the directions were on the first page of the manual, she replied angrily, "I paid $2000 for this %!?* thing and I'm not going to read a book!"

A frustrated buyer called to say her brand new computer would not work. She unpacked the unit, plugged it in, opened it up and sat there for 28 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she replied "What power switch?"

Seemingly simple features baffle some users. So many people called to ask where the "any" key was when "Press Any Key" appeared on the screen that one computer company is considering changing the message to "Press Return Key."

Some people can't figure out the mouse. One customer complained that her mouse was hard to control with the "dust cover" on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag it was shipped in. Another customer held the mouse, pointing it at the screen, all the while clicking madly. No response.

Disk drives are another bugaboo. One tech says a customer was having trouble reading word processing files from his old diskette. After troubleshooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, the tech asked what else was being done with the diskette. The response: "I put a label on it, rolled it into the typewriter...'

Another customer dutifully complied with a tech's request that she send in a copy of a defective floppy disk. Two days later, she sent in a letter along with a photocopy of the floppy. Another tech advised a customer to put his troubled floppy in the drive and "close the door." With a "hold on," the customer could be heard to walk across the room and shut the door to the room.

The software inside the computer can be equally confusing. A customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the tech discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor and hitting the "send" key.

Not realizing how fragile computers can be, some people end up damaging parts beyond repair. A customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it, he said, filling his tub with soap and water and soaking it for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.

Computers make some people paranoid. A tech says he once helped a man who became enraged because his computer had told him he was "bad" and an "invalid." Patiently, the tech explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid response" shouldn't be taken personally.

These days, PC-help techs increasingly find themselves taking on the role of amateur psychologists. A tech who once worked as a psychiatric nurse says he defused a potential domestic fight by soothingly talking a man through a computer problem after the man had screamed threats at his wife and children in the background.

## Workbench Menus from page 3

Remember that some menu items have hot key short cuts which you can use. These are shown when you access the pull-down menus. For example, you can press both the right Amiga key and the "n" key at the same time, or you can select "Window:New Drawer" from the pull-down menu. It is probably just a matter of preference, but I find it faster to just pull down the menus and make my selections with the mouse!

Well, I hope you will find the pull-down menus as helpful as most of us do. You can even add custom menu items by using a tool called "Tools Daemon", which is available on the MCCC BBS or at one of the chapter meetings. That is how I can launch almost all of my programs without ever having to open a drawer and search for a program's icon. I strongly recommend it!

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

Nothing really new here, except a new version of an old standby. DiskSalv 2, for those who are not in the know, is the premiere disk recovery/repair program. It will salvage lost files, repair damaged disks or recover deleted files. For those who are thinking about buying Quarterback Tools or Ami-Back Tools, you may want to look here first. From what I have seen and heard, this is the best of the lot — and it's free. Of course, there is a commercial version of DiskSalv as well, called DiskSalv 3, available for $40, but in the meantime this one is VERY powerful and it's available on MCCC-A \_813. The shareware registration fee is $10.

## Virus Checker v6.51 by John Veldthuis

On MCCC-A\_827, is another new version of an old standby. Virus Checker is my personal favorite among the virus detection/protection utilities. What can I say, except that this is the latest version and you need to stay current. Get it.

## ShowObj v2.1 by Andreas Heumann

We've had ShowObj in the library once before. For those who don't remember, it's a program that shows 3D objects directly, without having to fire up Imagine or Lightwave. That right, I said Lightwave. That's one of the major things that's new in this revision. If you work in 3D, this tool is invaluable. It's fast and easy to use. It will show objects in bounding box mode, wireframe mode or solid mode. It will show top, right, top or perspective views. In perspective view, you can zoom with the right mouse button and rotate with the left. Just get it. It's on MCCC-A\_815.

## PageStream 3.0 Update

For PageStream 3.0 owners, here's the latest. There are two upgrades on this month's disks. On MCCC-A\_817 and 818 is the upgrade to take you from 3.0d to 3.0e (distributed in archive format). On MCCC-A\_825 is the upgrade from 3.0e to 3.0f. By the time you're finished, you'll find you still have a work-in-progress, with many features still not working. But on the other hand, at least it gets better with each release - and at least we're getting updates. Soft-Logik is one of the few companies still supporting our computers.

## Jouster by Matt Westfall

Remember the old classic game Joust? It's an action game. Your player rides an ostrich-like flying creature and carries a lance. You're up against similar characters riding similar creatures. To destroy your opponent, you must hit him from above. (If he hits you from above, you get destroyed instead.) When you hit an opponent, an egg drops to a lower level. If allowed to sit for any length of time, the egg will hatch and a new opponent will emerge ready to be picked up by another ostrich-like creature shortly. You must collect the eggs. All of this sounds simple — and it is, in a way — but controlling a bird with any degree of accuracy is difficult. Each flap of the wings carries you higher, but then you reach the top of the arc and begin to fall again. In the meantime, there are pterodactyls to confuse things and a hand that reaches up to grab you from a lake of fire if you hesitate while flying over it. Confused? Just get the game and find out for yourself. It's on MCCC-A\_822. It's distributed in archive format.

## Magic Workbench Icons

Still looking for more icons to use with the Magic Workbench palette? I know I am. There are a couple of collections on this month's disks. AWIcons, a collection by Alisdair Walker, is on MCCC-A\_826. ROMIcons7, a collection by Roman Patzner, is on MCCC-A\_829. They are both beautifully done and would be a nice addition to anyone's collection.

## LZX by Data Compression Technologies

Another archive utility? Yep! We haven't had any new ones in quite some time. The reason was simple — no-one seemed able to beat the speed or compression capabilities of the current crop. All that has changed overnight. LZX breaks new ground. Its compression improvement varies, but normally runs 15-30% better than LhA. Compression speeds are, on average, about 15% faster — and decompression speeds can range up to 3 times as fast. This is simply the best archive utility you can get...so get it...then send in your shareware fee. It's on MCCC-A\_830.

## JPEG-Pictures

A very nice collection this month — especially for art-lovers. We have a collection of 48 pictures from Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masters. Van Gogh is represented, of course, with such pieces as Noon: Rest From Work and Pollard Willows with Setting Sun. Monet is on hand with Impression: Sunrise and Regatta at Argenteuil among others. You'll also find Manet, Degas, Beraud, Renoir, Gauguin and many more. The quality is excellent, even though they are limited to only 256 colors. The collection spans three disks: MCCC-A\_830 through 832. If you keep any kind of computer art collection at all, I can't imagine that you won't want to add these to it. /

## CDs

## deep dish style McHenry County Computer Club

cientists at IBM have pushed data storage into the Sost she more a can ma a cape se could offer more than ten times the capacity of today's compact disks. The result could substantially broaden the uses of audio CD, computer CD-ROMs and video CD. You may, for example, be able to hear the entire Beatles collection on one disk, or view one or more full length feature movies on a single video CD.

Until now, researchers have tried to cram more information onto a disk's appearance. The assumption was that, without an aluminum film, a polycarbonate disk would not be capable of reflecting a laser strongly enough for a playing head to read the disk's data.

But scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California found that the disks themselves do provide some reflectivity. The researchers were able to amplify the resulting faint signal to a level the head could read.

The technique does away with the reflective aluminum film in conventional, opaque disks. The result: transparent disks can be glued together in a single, multilayered stack. Movable-lens technology allows a standard infra-red laser to focus on any one of the data surfaces without being disrupted by the data pits of adjacent layers.

The C0.inventor of the technology, Hal Rosen of IBM, envisions a laser working through stacks of more than ten layers of data, holding more than one million pages of text.

Patty Change, an analyst with Dataquest, predicts that twolayer CD-ROMs for music, video and computer applications will hit the market in two to three years. "They will take off in the consumer electronics market first," she says. Recordable disks could come later.

## GeoFax

an all-new program for the C64 Double Click, LACC

he first program of its kind ever for the program is called GeoFax and, yes, it does just what the name implies. It will allow you to send and receive faxes with your 64 or 128 in 40-column mode.

Operating within the GEOS environment, GeoFax allows you to send and receive documents in the form of a GeoPaint file. As far as the machine at the other end is concerned, it is sending or receiving a real fax document.

All of the conversion is handled by GeoFax. With the ability for most any application to create its printer output in the form of a GeoPaint file, you will now have a capability that you never had before. Just save your Geo Write file as multiple GeoPaint files and then use GeoFax to transmit each page to a remote fax machine or another computer that is also equipped with fax capabilities. GeoFax can also transmit documents in its own GeoFax format, while retaining the full resolution of the document.

Just think, you could even connect a real facsimile machine to your fax/modem with a telephone cord, and

Naturally, you will need GEOS 64 or 128 V2.0 to use GeoFax, along with a suitable fax/modem and a CMD SwiftLink cartridge.

with GeoFax you would have a fullpage scanner.

As of this writing, GeoFax is being beta tested and the printed manual is being finished. Orders for the software will be taken starting in the first week of January, 1995. The retail price is $39.95, plus $4.00 for shipping and handling, with $4.00 additional for COD orders. You can send check or money order to: Maurice Randall, P.O.

## SnoopDOS

find out what's really going on by Jim Lawrence — Amiga-Dayton User Group noopDOS is a program that I use often when I am open a window that shows all the accesses to AmigaDOS. Even though a program can use its own functions, it is often desirable to use functions that are already provided in libraries. The program will load this library into RAM using AmigaDOS just like you would run a program by typing it in. It will also load in fonts, devices, and lots of other goodies. The best way to show how SnoopDOS can help you out is by giving a few examples.

Sharon recently had a problem with a program that would not run. The program spent a lot of time loading up, then it would exit before a single function executed. First, the problem is that a program should not have exited without saying something. Unfortunately, it is the responsibility of the programmer to supply this basic courtesy. Without a clue to work on, I loaded up SnoopDOS to see if the program was loading up a library or used some other DOS call that might give me a hint as to the problem. SnoopDOS revealed that the program used DOS to laad up two libraries. Armed with this information, I would use the Version command to see what revision of the library I had on the machine that it worked on and compared that to the machine that it failed on. Getting the correct version of a library will often solve a troublesome program. It turned out that neither of those libraries were at fault and the trouble lied elsewhere, but that's a good start a troubleshooting.

SnoopDOS is very good at showing you the basic workings of your machine. I have learned a lot about my machine by starting up SnoopDOS and letting it run while I go about my business. I was disappointed with the performance of my machine while I was using the CDROM until SnoopDOS showed me a big tip. Since I am lazy at heart, I would use AmigaDOS 2's ability to change directories just by typing the name of a directory that was in the path. It wasn't until I ran SnoopDOS that I realized that the system doesn't know that the name I type is the name of a directory until it checks EVERY directory in the path to see if there's a command by that name first. THEN it checks to see if there's a directory by that name. Now, if you're in a large directory on a slow CD-ROM — great big performance hit. Now I just "CD" to the directory I want for instantaneous directory changes.

Anyhow, SnoopDOS comes highly recommended and is absolutely necessary for serious troubleshooting. Floppy disk users should not fear, because it is a very small program too.

SnoopDOS will also show if a program tries to load a library that fails and the program still runs. I notice that ViewTek will try to load a xpk.library that I don't have. Will the program run better if I had it?

## Merger!

microsoft and the vatican to join forces by Hank Vorjes — Amiga Users of the Heartland

V ATICAN CITY (AP) - In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square this morning, Microsoft Corp. and the Vatican announced that the Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of Microsoft common stock. If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software company has acquired a major world religion.

With the acquisition, Pope John Paul Il will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while Microsoft senior vicepresidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.

"We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years," said Gates. "The combined resources of Microsoft and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people."

Vinci. But critics say Microsoft will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.

"The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures," said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. "You take the parting of the Red Sea — we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene."

But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage. "The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger audience," notes Notre Dame theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.

Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive

Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates. "You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution - even reduce your time in Purgatory all without leaving your home."

A new software application, Microsoft Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.

An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St. Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello - in character as Father Guido Sarducci - hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.

Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates,

"Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats," the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.

The deal grants Microsoft exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach "the four corners of the earth," echoing Microsoft's vision of "a computer on every desktop and in every home."

Gates described Microsoft's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired - "One religion, a couple of different implementations," said Gates.

Not often do we get a meeting on an important day like Valentine's Day. Many couples go out for a night of celebration of their love and affection for each other on this night. On the other hand those of us who like our Amigas apparently preferred to attend our monthly get together. 26 people made that choice this month. From the way things went, they made the right choice!

David Owens started this month's meeting with an officer introduction. We then proceeded to our usually interesting question and answer session. Tonight we were a bit short on questions. Only two came up, but what questions they were! One asked about a communication protocol in programming. The other was about unarchiving files downloaded from our BBS. Hopefully they got their answer. From there we went to rumors, also a bit on the light side. Deluxe Paint V is due out this month, PageStream 3.0 continues its updates with 3.0f, and people were talking about the new 2200 being advertised.

Our main presentation came from Harold Williams. He showed us an ARexx setup for Final Copy that allowed a club member with a typing disability to continue their creative abilities to flow onto paper. Though the setup for the person was very interesting, the real topic that took over a majority of the presentation, was the ARexx programming. We had so much discussion on ARexx that the lights started going out to remind us to get out. If you are one of those who made the other choice of what to do on Valentine's Day, then I can say maybe you made the wrong choice.

Oddly enough, our next meeting will be on the same day of the month, the fourteenth.

With repairs to the church completed and things getting back in order to the building, this month's meeting was held back in our usual spot, the meeting hall in the basement. We had about fifteen members show up. Unfortunately, our presenter for the evening, supposed to be demonstrating the newest version of CanDo, had to bow out at the last moment and thus, our meeting began with a discussion of the latest news of Commodore.

In fact, there was some news! (Although, maybe not all of it good.) Acting master of ceremonies for the evening, Steve Nichols, mentioned calling the Commodore Hotline and finding out that there was a deal with several investors to buy whatever is left of Commodore, but that Gould and Ali have filed a lawsuit to prevent the deal going thru. The whole case involves business legalities and liabilities involved in the Bahaman and American courts. As far as Amiga users are concerned, it is just as big a mess as it ever was.

On the brighter side, several members who had mentioned last month that they had not received their issue of Amazing Computing reported that they had been sent the newest issues of Amazing Computing, although kind of late. Apparently, the magazine was waiting for news on the Commodore happenings and missed their deadline date with the printers and so had to wait for their turn to come around again (or something like that...), or so this is what I hear from the grapevine. Speaking of magazines, one member brought several magazines from Europe and passed them around for the audience to browse through. These magazines are really something spectacular and several of them are available from

Metropolitan Computing

Somehow the meeting ended up on a discussion of OctaMed. OctaMed is a fully featured music and sampling program. And...since we didn't have a presenter...and Steve's Amiga was just sitting there... Steve gave a short demonstration on just what OctaMed can do. He even played back some songs he had composed himself which were quite impressive. Needless to say, we were all very impressed. If you have never taken the time to explore the Amiga's sound and music qualities, you have missed one of the best attributes of your computer.

The discussion then turned to a question and answer session on backing up files with Quarterback and several problems that had arisen thereof. One member mentioned that currently, Intelligent Designs is offering owners of Quarterback or Quarterback Tools the chance to purchase Ami-Back or Ami-Back Tools at discount prices. Also, Grollier's Encyclopedia on CD-ROM is available for all Amigas now.

One last note: Steve would welcome any suggestions for future presentations for our meetings. As he said, "...tell me what you want to see and I'll try to get it!" As far as getting demonstrations and presenters for our meetings, he has been nothing short of spectacular. So please, if you have a suggestion or know somebody (including yourself!, let him know about it. Our next meeting is March 16th. See ya'll there!

Howdy, Metro C-64/128 Users! Technical difficulties prevented January's meeting from making the newsletter, but I promise we'll make that up now, as well as bring you

## CHAPTER NEWS

news from the February meeting.

Our January meeting started out with Phil Heberer telling us about the new GeoFax program for the C-64 and 128. With GeoFax, you can send and receive text and picture FAXs just like businesses who have FAX machines and IBMers who have FAX modems! A great way to complement the GEOS line of products. Another great new product coming out for GEOS users is GeoPublish. What, you say that has already been out for years? Well, this one is 80 column for the 128. And yes, it is really going to be released! Phil also showed some of the basics for setting up DesTerm 2.01, a great shareware terminal program.

implemented for BB Talker to work with the Write Stuff, the full-blown word processor. It can speak by spelling words phonetically or the regular way.

Joe Avery shared some new

BBS numbers: Star Palace at (817) 337-0307 and another at 735-8308. For new BBS listings, he said to call 467-1175. Some others that the MCCC BBS lists for C-64/128 Users are System Control at (817) 268-2204, 268-1812, and 268-67637; Back Room at (817) 232-5075; Hell's Half Acre at (214) 319-7866; and Excalabur's Stone at (214) 699-7566. Phil provided most of these numbers to MCCC.

If you missed our February meeting, you missed some wonderful home-made confections and Valentine's treats.

Mike Sessums finally added 15 new HAM and SWL disks to the library. Mike received them from a HAM C-64 user in California about six months ago, but was a little slow on getting copies made for the library.

Phil Heberer demonstrated SAM. It was brought by the Lees and

Phil showed us a QWKR 128 user booklet that was created in GeoPublish by R. Gasson, a Commodore user. This book was excellent. What made it really interesting was that Phil's friend translated the original QWKR 128 guide into German for the great number of QWKR 128 users in that country. Also, the book was about 60 pages long, and GeoPublish only lets you create files with a maximum of about 16 pages each. What must have been a publication nightmare for the user/publisher turned out beautifully.

One of the members was having problems with SuperBase. She said she got the title screen, but then the screen went blank and she couldn't use the program. The problem was that she needed the 128 monitor cable that passes both the C64 and the 128 video signals to the monitor, and needed to punch the 40/80 column video switch on the computer when she saw the start up screen to get her into the proper video mode for the program. One way you can tell what mode you are in is that the title screen is white for 40 column (64 mode) and black and white for 80 column (128 mode). CMD has a new book called SuperBase: the Book for $15 that is a must for SuperBase users.

See you at the next meeting!
