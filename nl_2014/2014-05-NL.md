## Commodore Goes Out Of Business

AMIG/CD*

April 29, 1994

WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of business.

The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees 'for the benefit of its creditors' and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Ltd., into voluntary liquidation.

'This  is  the  initial  phase  of  an orderly voluntary liquidation of both companies,' Commodore said in a brief statement.

Company executives could not immediately be reached Friday evening.

The  company  last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter ending Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost $77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million in the same period.

In the latest report, Commodore  said financial limits had thwarted its ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new products, the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the company did most of its business.

The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last June 30.

Its  stock, which had traded at around $3 per share before the quarterly results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87 1/2 cents per share on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.

While  grabbing  some  market share and attention in the late 1970s, Commodore's products were something between PCs and game machines 'and never quite became either,' Coursey said.

Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter repair company in the Bronx. Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it to make calculators and then personal computers by the mid-1970s.

'This is a company that briefly captured  the  attention  of  the American market and didn't go where the market was going,' said David  Coursey,  editor  of  the newsletter  P.C.  Letter  in  San Mateo, Calif. 'They just never managed  to  change  with  the marketplace.'

Commodore  competed  with Radio  Shack  for  the  first computers sold to homes and co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly-regarded figure in the fledgling PC industry.

By  the  early  1980s,  it  was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple Computer Inc. and IBM. Software manufacturers didn't create  as  much  software  for Commodore's Amiga line as it did  for  Apple  and  IBM-

compatible machines.

In recent years, most of  Commodore's business  was  in Europe.

NewTek  Inc.  of Topeka, Kan., created a product called Video Toaster that converted Commodore's Amiga to  a  video-editing system. The $2,500 product was popular with small advertising agencies and home hobbyists.

The company's phones were busy Friday night.

## I Am a Software Pirate

Some years ago I came across a really  great  Windows  program (Creative Element Power Tools) that added a ton of cool, geeky, power-user  features  to  the operating system. I immediately registered and happily paid for the program mostly to support the authors and to escape the trialversion  time  limit.  I  liked  this software so much that I bought a second copy for another machine I use frequently.

A few weeks ago, I installed a new boot drive on my main machine and the program popped up an error  that  it  had  expired  and  I needed to enter my registration code. No problem, I thought, since I meticulously save all registration codes. No dice. The developer has ceased  development  of  the program  and  apparently disconnected  the  online registration  key  validation mechanism. The website was of no help and the company would not respond to multiple emails.

Today I needed one of the features and  was  frustrated  that  this function, which I paid for, was not available. After more fiddling with trying  to  get  the  program  to recognize my valid registration key I did what I had to do: I looked for a 'cracked' copy of the software.

That was pretty easy to find but I was  nervous  about  installing something  so  dubious  on  my beloved main PC. The first attempt to install the faux version failed since  Windows  (rightfully) demanded administrator privileges to  modify  anything  in  the Programs directory. Now I'm really on the brink of totally toasting my machine  if  this  illicit  software includes a trojan or other malware. I  scanned  the  file  for  malware, checked that my boot-disk-image backup was up to date, gritted my teeth  and  selected  'Run  as Administrator.'  The  'cracked' program copied some files and reported a successful installation. I rebooted  and  lo  and  behold, Creative Elements Power Tools was  happily  running  on  my machine providing me with the

Something  is  wrong  with  a software distribution model that disables  the  product  if  the developer decides to discontinue support.  I  was  forced  to  the underworld  of  the  Internet  to unlock something I have already paid for. I guess I am happy that the  pirates  who  'cracked'  the program are out there, but I'm not pleased that I was forced to live in their world.
