## The Amiga Past and Present

As I write this, Chinese New Year, which l do honor, is here. The next 15 days are at best unusual in my home. I find myself looking back on a number of things right now as I prepare for things to come. It's been a long run. Back when I graduated High school, 3 decades ago, there was an event held in Chicago in June. It was a computer show called CES. Now at  this  time  hardware  was  no longer the big thing. IBM and Apple,  two  of  the  biggest contenders  in  the  PC  market, didn't even attend CES. Software though was a huge seller. Even then  there  was  some  new hardware to be found at the show. Atari showed off its new high-end system the 'Atari 1400 XL' and Microsoft was showing, at a private party, the Japanese MSX-standard home computers due to arrive in the US in the next year. Commodore also showcased two new computers, the Plus/4 and the Commodore 16. However at this show there  was  something very special. Compute! magazine reported this on it: 'What might be the  most  advanced personal computer ever designed was shown to the world behind closed doors…' They also stated on the prototype system 'graphics are a whole step ahead of any personal computer now on the  market.  This  computer  is potentially powerful enough to make an IBM PC look like a fourfunction calculator.' Even though it  didn't  release  on  time  for Christmas, it did a year after that show and it awed, amazed and even worried folks at the show. The code name of that computer at the show was 'Lorraine.' The Amiga Lorraine. We've come a long way indeed. I bought the Amiga A1000 in 1985 shortly after it  made  it  to  the  local  stores. Never regretted it and never will. I have a PDF of that Compute! magazine for those curious. There isn't much on the Amiga but it's fun to see what was out there back then.

Now then, back in the present. For the few gamers we have, the

Arcade Evolution Amiga/C64 Joystick was released. You can find it at AmigaKit in 2 versions left  and  right  handed  designs. Personally I'm going to pass on this one. It has a sturdy design and switches, but at about 8 x 8 x 2 inches so that you are supposed to rest your wrist on it. I can't figure out how to hold it and hit the twin huge buttons. Also, if the bright red looks-like-paddedvinyl  case  doesn't  scare  you, AmigaKit wants $68.42  for  it. (Amiga A600 users can't use it without  an  extra  adapter.) V.A.M.P.,  which  stands  for 'Virtual Amiga Multimedia Player,' has a new version out, v1.08. This is actually a multi platform viewer available  for  AmigaOS3.x  (A graphics  card  is  needed), AmigaOS4, MorphOS, and even WarpOS (For those of us with PPC boards in our Amigas). This shows  and  plays  more  image, video and audio formats than you can shake a stick at. Even the old

Moviesetter files Eric used to use. To do so though it requires you to get  various  codecs, plugins, datatypes and libraries - but they do give links  telling  you where to get them legally and  mostly  free. (WapDT  are  still shareware.) They state this as being portable. You can run it off a flash drive or such (however the plugins and such have to be in Libs:).

Also for Amiga, X-bEnCh O.93F The Amiga Game Launcher &amp; More is out. I reported a little on this a while back and this would seem to be a fair  sized  update. What this is is a front-end that can autoscan your hard drive to find all your whdload games or .exe and organize them in launching listings. It can also manage the software manuals listings and has an internal script  system  for  non-whdload games and other things. You can find this and learn more on it at http://www.jimneray.com/xbench .html.  'Amiga  Future  monthly News January 2014' is out. It's easier  to  see  some  of  it  here http://www.amigafuture.de since it has a number of helpful items and a  great  number  of  games  and software for both classic and the newer AmigaOS as well as for MorphOS.

Now then, for MorphOS we are currently at version 3.4. Most of what's in this release was bug fixes. It introduces faster R300 graphics drivers, which gives improved 3D graphics and video playback on G5-based  systems,  and  also support  for  non-native  display resolutions on various PowerBooks. Onyx Soft has released 2 software updates,  SnaplT  v1.3  and ZoomlT.pobj  v1.1.  SnaplT, available for MorphOS, AROS, and OS4, is a fairly powerful screen grabber. ZoomlT.pobj is a neat zoom tool for Ambient panels. I would advise checking out their page at http://www.onyxsoft.se/as they do have quite a few programs for  AmigaOS,  MorphOS  and AROS systems. Hollywood 5 and Hollywood Designer 4 are available for purchase again. For those that don't  know,  'Hollywood  is  a multimedia-oriented programming language that can be used to create graphical  applications.'  I  can't seem to find a price anywhere for this and it would seem you have to email order@airsoftsoftwair.com in order to order it. Not sure if this offer is still available but the article I saw suggested that you could get the windoze version free with the Amiga  version.  Odyssey  Web Browser (OWB) 1.23 was released about the middle of last month as well. I'm glad to say this seems to be a title that is well maintained and supported.

As some may have noticed I've been a bit 'bitter' on some of the items here. This is not a lack of love for the Amiga. It's a loathing for what some have done and are doing to it. I was listening to a song I downloaded earlier from YouTube. 'Just Glue Some Gears On It (And Call It Steampunk).' It got me thinking: 'Paint it red and it's Amiga.' This seems to happen far too often anymore. Don't get

MCCC      4418 Sharpsburg Drive      Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org me wrong - there are good and real things too. As funding allows it I will in fact be getting several NEW items for mine. 'There are emulators that can run your stuff.' Or worse the 'just use this and that program. Gimp, Photoshop, notepad.' Yeah whatever. Been getting a lot of that. Folks all over are saying to let go of my A 1200. That if there is anything I need from it just to emulate for it. Why do I need a real machine? I've heard many say that the Amiga, PPC and even MorphOS are dead. Even from some of those in our small group. Personally, by my way of thinking and definitions however,  I  can't  see  it  or understand it. I realize that my way of thinking and looking at just about anything is not very popular. The fact is that there is still new and real hardware and software being made for these machines. That alone speaks of life to me. 30 years ago we WOWed them. It's taken them that long to get plug and  play  mostly  working.  My A1200 is currently still down, but she is far from dead and she still wows them.

Take care and be safe.
