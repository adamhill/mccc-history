## 'New' Amigas

The Amiga world has been a little light  on  hard  news so far this month,  so  I  will  do  a  little hypothetical exploration instead. One of the recurring themes in the world of 'new' Amigas is the idea  of  using  new  hardware concepts to recreate the function of the original Amiga hardware in one sense or another. This is in contrast to the 'modern' Amiga and Amiga-derived systems which use  mostly  general-purpose PowerPC or other hardware and video cards running Amiga OS4, MorphOS, or AROS. Like Amiga emulation in one way, and very different in another, these 'newretro' developments use new and configurable hardware like FPGA chips to recreate the functions of the  original  Amiga  chips.  The purpose of these is generally to be as compatible as possible with classic Amiga software (including the ones that 'bang the metal' programming the chips directly) while implementing benefits from newer hardware, like speed and network or USB interfaces.

The early implementations were designs like the 'Minimig,' which was functionally equivalent to an Amiga 500 and worked much like a game console loading Amiga games from disk image files. More recent  implementations  like FPGArcade  and  others  made possible greater speed, memory, and storage, the ability to function as more advanced Amiga models, or even switch to act as multiple computer  systems  or  game consoles in one device. It kinda parallels Amiga emulation in a way. From there, the next step is to make the Amiga systems we didn't have back in the day, but would've wanted. One (partial) example is a recent  CPU  replacement  / accelerator for the modest Amiga 600 system, using the Apollo CPU. Updated 'cores' for the CPU enable much greater throughput than the old 7 megahertz 68000, approaching the power of the 68040 or even 68060 chips while trying  to  retain  as  much compatibility as possible with the old CPU. With tech like this it gets more and more possible to have a classic Amiga compatible machine with  processing  brute  force competitive  with  your  gardenvariety PC.

Beyond that, the next step is to design a system which is not just an Amiga, but what the Amiga might  have  been  if  not  for Commodore's 1994 bankruptcy. This was the goal of the Natami team, whose project unfortunately appears  to  currently  be somewhere between stalled and dead.  The  increasingly hypothetical Natami hardware not only had a fast 680x0-compatible CPU, but also video and audio hardware that expanded on the Amiga  AGA  chipset  (and  the unproduced AAA) as well. Like most  of  these  'nuveau  retro' systems, the intent was to retain compatibility with the old Amiga hardware and software (even the 'metal banging' software) while expanding capability and adding new features. The abilities might not match those of an average PC video card, but should still far outclass the old Amiga systems. While it started out with a lot of apparent enthusiasm, the Natami project  has  lost  most  of  its momentum and focus, and might never be completed at this point. Some of the work done may find its way into other projects, like how the Apollo CPU core is being used to accelerate existing Amigas.

I'm of mixed feelings about the need  for  'updated  classic' hardware  systems  like  I  have described here. My G5 former Mac running MorphOS shows me what may very well be the top end  of  an  OS-level  Amiga compatible  system.  Amiga emulators running on fast PC hardware can do as well or better, with  reasonable  compatibility running as fast as the CPU will allow. Still, there will remain the allure  of  'real'  hardware, however illusory. There is still Amiga software I use (or would like to use) which requires Amiga hardware  to  work,  with  no equivalent  for  my  MorphOS machine. It would be nice to have some  powerful,  reliable, compatible new hardware out there which meets or exceeds the specs on my Amiga 4000 tower with  the  68060  processor,

QQQQ0 Attention: Great Laptop Ahoy!

Pros: -Outstanding specs for the price essentially giving me a spare or replacement for my decade-plus-old Amiga system without missing a beat. It might be a pipe dream at this point, but achievable with time and appropriate focused effort. Without dreams, the Amiga might never have existed in the first place, so I'll keep dreaming.

Cons: -Doesn't make dial-up noise when connecting to internet

-When not plugged in, battery will eventually die and remain dead until recharged

-Will not play laserdiscs

-Has an "alt" button

-Smells like vomit if you throw up on it

-Can't travel through walls so if I'm upstairs and the laptop is downstairs, guess who isn't watching old episodes of Dr. Quinn on Hulu tonight?
