## 'MOD' Music

As many know (but I will give a slight introduction) the  .mod  music  played  a  big  part  of  the  Amiga history and was used in video games in the 90's for their ability to carry a sound sample and stretch into a respectable song while using very little memory compared to regular recordings.

I've  been  a  big  fan  of  the  .mod  files  since  the ModPlayer  that  was  developed  for  the  Newton MessagePad in the late 90's.  Since that time I have 'tracked' the Mod scene and happy to say it is still very active. The information below is to bring to your awareness gigs and gigs of mods for probably months of enjoyment if played end to end.

## The Computer Mouse Still Roars

I said goodbye to my mouse last month. It was time to advance, I thought, to a higher plane of input, a trackpad that works like a tablet's screen. Instead of point and click, I'd swipe and flick.

A few weeks in, I was missing my mouse. Moving a folder across a 27-inch iMac screen with the trackpad was like lugging a grand piano across the Sahara-I had to keep taking breaks along the way, as I ran out of pad.

This can't be progress. Determined, I rustled up a dozen of the latest input devices, regular mice and trackpads,  but  also  vertical  mice,  pen  and  knobshaped mice, a touch-screen stylus, even a controller that  lets  you  wave  your  hands  around  without touching anything, a la 'Minority Report.'

What I discovered: Thirty years after the Macintosh took the mouse mainstream, I couldn't find anything more  precise  or  comfortable  for  operating  a computer. More important, I found the mouse has managed to reinvent itself over the years-it's like the Madonna of PC peripherals.

grip: the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse by Microsoft. Other standouts I tested were  Apple's  Magic  Mouse,  the Penclic  Mouse  and  Logitech's Ultrathin Touch Mouse.

Picking a control device is kind of like choosing shoes-some go for Air Jordans,  others  for  Christian Louboutin heels. Everyone has their own size and physical fit-sometimes even a medical need. (My right-handed editor swears by a trackball mouse in his left hand.)

Though PC sales have declined in recent years, mouse unit sales slipped only  3%  in  the  past  12  months, according to industry research firm NPD. In other words, a good chunk of laptop buyers are adding mice to their productivity ensembles.

To test my efficiency using a mouse and  other  input  devices,  I  used  a program scientists developed to study the  speed-accuracy  trade-offs  in human muscle movements, called Fitts's  Law.  My  scores,  based  on clicking scattered dots on a screen, were at times nearly twice as fast with a mouse as with a trackpad. Most hands are more relaxed on a mouse, so starting and stopping are easier, say the ergonomists.

(You  can  try  it  for  yourself  with different kinds of devices-and wade through a tutorial about Fitts' Law (http://bit.ly/MNwPgT). Skip to Step 20 for the test itself.)

Of  course,  for  flipping  pages  or pinching to zoom, finger gestures on a touch screen or trackpad are the more efficient way.

Both  Apple  and  Microsoft  have integrated finger gestures into their latest  computer operating systems. Apple sells  iMacs  with  a  trackpad option.  Microsoft  built  the  latest Windows version in the hope that users touch the screen itself.

A touch-screen monitor on a desktop or laptop sounds good, but it invites what some call 'gorilla-arm' fatigue. After forcing myself to use only the touch screen on a Windows 8.1 laptop, I found myself propping it up at an angle in my lap so my hands could rest on the side. (Microsoft says the touch screen is meant to supplement, not replace, other inputs.)

Then  there  is  a  problem  of universality: Designers haven't yet come up with a common language for touch on computers. In Windows 8.1, a swipe from the left lets you switch between  apps,  while  on  a  Mac trackpad, three fingers, moving in the same  direction,  open  a  widget dashboard. And neither movement is particularly intuitive.

The  emerging  world  of  touchless computing confuses things more. The Leap  Motion,  which  tracks  the movement of hands, lets you do cool tricks. But every compatible program comes with its own set of new moves you have to learn. And the accuracy of floating fingers is low. Leap Motion says its device isn't a replacement for the  mouse,  just  an  accessory  for software  that  benefits  from  3-D controls.

Mouse designers have made leaps in ergonomics.  Many  are  now  more vertical, better mimicking the posture of a hand in its natural resting state. 'Your fingers are curled into your palm, but not all evenly,' says Edie Adams, an ergonomist at Microsoft.

My  favorite  mouse  was  one  she worked  on,  Microsoft's  wireless Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse ($60 or less). It looks like a plum, with an overly ripe area where you rest your thumb. It is comfortable enough to use for hours,  the  mouse  equivalent  of orthopedic  shoes.  And  props  to Microsoft for apparently getting it to run on one pair of AA batteries for a whole year. I'll even use it on my Mac.

The runner-up was the even more vertical $90 Penclic. That familiar pen shape gave me a sense of control I wasn't expecting.

Today's mice also do a better job at adding features through gestures, so they don't get overloaded with extra buttons. Apple's $70 Magic Mouse may be less comfortable to hold over extended periods than the ergonomic options, but it does the best job of integrating touch commands on its smooth, flat surface-such as swiping with two fingers to advance through pages or browse photos. Logitech's $70  Ultrathin  Touch  Mouse  puts similar gesture functionality into a body small enough to travel with a laptop.

The idea shouldn't be to try to 'outmouse the mouse' with new kinds of inputs, says Josh Clark, a computer interface designer and founder of the firm  Global  Moxie.  Rather,  we're moving to a world of technology and input devices designed to fit specific times and places: touch screens on the go, voice activation for TVs, hand gestures to browse a store display with products.

I spend a growing part of my day with smartphones  and  tablets,  but  like many professionals, when I need to get work done, I'm still sitting in a chair facing a big computer screen. And there, the mouse remains king.

## Cyberspace is Filling Up

From The Sunday Times April 26, 2009

Internet  users  will  face  regular 'brownouts'  that  will  freeze  their computers as capacity runs out in cyberspace, according to research to be published later this year.

Experts  predict  that  consumer demand, already growing at 60 per cent a year, will start to exceed supply from as early as next year because of more people working online and the soaring  popularity  of  bandwidthhungry websites such as YouTube and services such as the BBC's iPlayer.

It will initially lead to computers being disrupted and going offline for several minutes  at  a  time.  From  2012, however, PCs and laptops are likely to operate  at  a  much  reduced  speed, rendering the Internet an 'unreliable toy.'

When Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the British scientist,  wrote  the  code  that transformed  a  private  computer network into the world wide web in 1989, the Internet appeared to be a limitless resource. However, a report being compiled by Nemertes Research, a respected American think-tank, will warn  that  the  web  has  reached  a critical  point  and  that  even  the recession  has  failed  to  stave  off impending problems.

'With more people working or looking for work from home, or using their PCs more for cheap entertainment, demand could double in 2009,' said Ted Ritter, a Nemertes analyst. 'At best, we see the [economic] slowdown delaying the fractures for maybe a year.'

In America, telecoms companies are spending £40 billion a year upgrading cables and supercomputers to increase capacity, while in Britain proposals to replace copper cabling across part of the  network  with  fibreoptic  wires would cost at least £5 billion.

Yet sites such as YouTube, the videosharing  service  launched  in  2005, which has exploded in popularity, can throw the most ambitious plans into disarray.

The amount of traffic generated each month by YouTube is now equivalent to the amount of traffic generated across the entire Internet in all of 2000.

The  extent  of  its  popularity  is indicated by the 100 million people who have logged on to the site to see the  talent  show  contestant  Susan Boyle in the past three weeks.

Another so-called 'net bomb' being studied by Nemertes is BBC iPlayer, which allows viewers to watch highdefinition  television  on  their computers. In February there were more than 35 million requests for shows and iPlayer now accounts for 5 per cent of all UK internet traffic.

Analysts  express  such  traffic  in exabytes - a quintillion (or a million trillion) bytes or units of computer data. One exabyte is equivalent to 50,000 years' worth of DVD-quality data.

Monthly traffic across the Internet is running at about eight exabytes. A recent  study  by  the  University  of Minnesota estimated that traffic was growing by at least 60 per cent a year, although  that  did  not  take  into account plans for greater Internet access in China and India.

While the  net  itself  will  ultimately survive,  Ritter  said  that  waves  of disruption would begin to emerge next year, when computers would jitter  and  freeze.  This  would  be followed  by  'brownouts'  -  a

combination of temporary freezing and computers being reduced to a slow speed.

Ritter's  report  will  warn  that  an unreliable Internet is merely a toy. 'For  business  purposes,  such  as delivering medical records between hospitals in real time, it's useless,' he said.

'Today  people  know  how  home computers slow down when the kids get back from school and start playing games, but by 2012 that traffic jam could last all day long.'

Engineers are already preparing for the worst. While some are planning a lightning-fast parallel network called 'the grid,' others are building 'caches,' private  computer  stations  where popular entertainments are stored on local PCs rather than sent through the global backbone.

Telephone companies want to recoup escalating costs by increasing prices for "net hogs" who use more than their share of capacity.
