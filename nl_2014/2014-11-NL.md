## Not  Much News

It's been a curious time, for me personally, if no one else. Checking around the Amiga news sources, there's not a ton of stuff going on, not that there usually is. A new game from Cherry Darling, makers of Flappy Bird clone 'Voxel Bird Saga,'  is  available,  called 'Voxelnoid,'  apparently  a Breakout/Arkanoid type of game, using the same voxel engine as their other  game(s).  So  if  you  enjoy pixely stuff with 3D effects, and you have an OS4 or MorphOS system, this might be right up your alley. On the hardware front, the ARES-II system is available for 249 Euro.  It  is  described  as  a 'Raspberry Pi on steroids,' and is a complete system with a case, and is pre-installed  with  AEROS,  an AROS/ Debian Linux hybrid with XBMC (media controller). Could be valuable to the right person, even if it's not the low base price of a bare Raspberry Pi board. In software, an update to AROS Vision, (version 2.8.1) an AROS distro for classic Amiga hardware, is now available. I'm not too certain exactly what the benefits are to using AROS over Amiga OS on your classic system, but I'm sure there's someone out there interested in finding out.

I had a chance to go to Cincinnati recently,  visiting  a  convention briefly. For me, going to Cincinnati or Columbus is also an opportunity to drop by Micro Center. I was also in the market for a new system or two (or five), as the Lenovo laptop I use as my primary web-surfing system is showing its age, not to mention years of accumulated dirt and  crumbs  in  the  keys.  Micro Center was advertising a laptop from ASUS for about $220, down from $300. The CPU is a form of Celeron, but as my demands for the system will be pretty low, I believe the system will be adequate to my needs. Like the computer market itself, it's interesting to think how, out of three laptop systems I've purchased in my life, each is less expensive than the last, as the specs increase. One I got around 2007 cost me over $500, with a netbook picked up a year or so later being about  $325.  This  new  one  for around $220 has a larger screen (not a touch screen this time around) with a 500GB SATA drive and 4GB of RAM. (Since pretty much every other computer I own doesn't exceed 1 gigabyte, this will be a step up. I'm reminded of when I last shopped for a new car, as I was impressed at all the features and electronics found in even a low-end auto trim package. That 4 Gig of RAM is similar to me, as most PC systems I saw had about 4 gig even on the low end. Presumably the proliferation of 64-bit processing and Windows 8 make that much RAM more a requirement than a luxury. I can only imagine what an Amiga or MorphOS system would do with that much RAM (if they actually  can  make  use  of  it). Hopefully a nice efficient Linux distro will make that about of RAM seem luxurious too. It appears I'll have to look into picking a distro sooner rather than later. I tried

turning the new laptop on just to check it out, but the first boot procedure under the pre-installed Windows 8 wouldn't keep going without me setting up an account with Microsoft. Since I have no intention of registering with MS just to preview a system I don't intend to have running Windows anyway, it would seem I may never see the Windows home screen on my  laptop,  not  that  that's  a negative really. I don't know what state I'll have the new machine in by this month's meeting, but I may bring it by regardless. I suppose if anyone has any live CDs for any distros they advocate, I'll be happy to give them a look-see.

## Belkin Routers Choke

Millions of Belkin router owners around  the  world  today complained  after  their  routers mysteriously refused to let them on the Internet. Complaints exploded on  Twitter  and  Facebook  this morning  indicating  that  an unspecified  number  of  Belkin routers  couldn't  access heartbeat.belkin.com in order to function properly. When users (and many ISP employees) went to the Belkin  website  to  complain  or investigate, they found the Belkin website down as well.

After  a  morning  of  user  anger, clogged phone support lines and total Belkin silence on the issue, the company finally posted this notice to their website shortly after noon:

'We are aware of reports of an interruption to Internet service when using some Belkin routers with several  Internet  service providers. Our team is diligently working to root cause the issue. Our  call  centers  are  also experiencing  a  higher  than normal call rate so hold times are longer than normal. Our call centers have no solution to this problem at this  time.  Please check this status page for further updates.'

[Note from khisel: Belkin is the same company that programmed web ads into some of their routers a few years ago. After viewing and displaying a number of web pages, the  router  would  hijack  the connection and attempt to sell the user  additional  Belkin  services. Given that, and now the news that some of their routers require the company's web site to be up and running to function, I think that this is clearly a company that does not understand  how  a  router  is supposed to work.]

## Microsoft Loves Android

Microsoft makes more money from Samsung  than  from  Skype, Windows  Phone,  and  Xbox combined

Android-the  most  widely-used mobile  operating  system  in  the world made by Google--actually owes a lot to patents owned by its erstwhile rival, Microsoft. There has been a lot of speculation about just how much Microsoft makes from royalty fees from Android handset users like Samsung and HTC. A glimpse  was  revealed  when Microsoft said in a legal filing that Samsung,  the  biggest  Android phonemaker in the world, paid the software maker more than $1 billion a  year  to  use  its  technology  in Samsung phones.

That division made a loss of $1.3 billion last year.

Another  way  to  put  that  in perspective-Microsoft makes more from Samsung in a year than Apple won in court after famously suing Samsung in California over violating its patents. And that doesn't include the money that Microsoft makes from  the  other  Android  phone manufacturers. As the Wall Street Journal  reported,  the  filing  that revealed the $1 billion figure was previously redacted and included in documents  in  court,  where Microsoft is accusing Samsung of failing  to  honor  a  2011  patentlicensing agreement.

To put that into perspective, that is more than the $848 million that Microsoft  made  last  year  in operating  income  in  its Entertainment and Devices Division, which includes the Xbox consoleincluding Kinect and Xbox Live Internet gaming network-as well as online video-calling service Skype, and  its  Windows  Phone  line. Samsung's  fees  also  compare favorably  to  Microsoft's  search engine Bing and the MSN Network.

How  much  is  Android  actually based on Microsoft technology? When  the  Chinese  ministry  of commerce approved Microsoft's purchase  of  Nokia  in  April, Microsoft  said  the  authorities 'concluded after its investigation that Microsoft holds approximately 200 patent families that are necessary to build an Android smartphone.'
