## 5 Amazing Pieces of Good News Nobody is Reporting

If you share some uplifting link with somebody  on  Facebook  -  some video of an act of human kindness captured on camera, or this dolphin masturbating with the aid of its little fish friend - the response is usually the same. 'Nice to see there are still heartwarming stories in this awful world!'

In other words, any positive news or trend is treated as the exception, when the overall arc of civilization is clearly downward. The only problem is that it is absolutely not true, and it's actually very easy to prove, as we have made it our mission to point out.

So you can sit around and worry about debt ceilings and terror attacks, but take a moment to appreciate that you happen  to  be  alive  during  the goddamned golden age of human civilization. Just think about the fact that…

The Waning of War

World-wide battle deaths per 100,000 people

muskets, to machine guns - right up to the modern era of poison gas and nukes that can murder every human on the planet in minutes. Mankind's technological growth has been marked mainly by increasingly efficient ways to slaughter each other.

Sure enough, the 20th century had to have been the most violent in human history. Two world wars, conflict in Southeast Asia, constant war in the Middle East - and those were just the ones that America was directly involved in. At the beginning of the 21st century, with Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and rumblings of war with Syria, it seems like the world is a pack of rabid  dogs  about  to  pounce  on  a Snausage pinata.

Even with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,  the  first  decade  of  the  21st century saw the number of annual battle  deaths  at  its  lowest  ever  in history.

- the  U.S.  lost  3,400  soldiers  in Afghanistan, which is terrible, but during the American Civil War, 4,700 troops were killed on one side of one single battle. Check it out in graph form below.

OK, so maybe this is just a temporary breather after the bloodbath that was the previous century? Nope - it's part of a long-term trend. As crazy as it seems to suggest it, the past couple of hundred years have been the most peaceful  in  world  history.  That's including the world wars.

(The  numbers  don't  lie:  Property crime, theft, and burglary have also all been dropping since around 1993. The De-Textbook has more on why you'd be just as safe leaving your doors  unlocked  now  as  your grandparents were in 'the good old days.')

Professor Joshua Goldstein put it best: 'If the world feels like a more violent place than it actually is, that's because there's more information about wars not more wars themselves.' Overall, we're in the midst of an unheard of 'long peace,' as no major powers have clashed since World War II, replacing them  with  smaller  wars  that historically would count as skirmishes

## #5. We're Closing in on World Peace (Seriously)

This one seems laughable mankind  has  gone  from fighting  with  swords,  to

Yes,  in  absolute  numbers,  more people  died  violently  in  the  20th century than in any other century but that's because there are so many more people now. The chances that a person  living  in  the  20th  century would die  violently  were  about  3 percent.  That's  a  historically  low number - it was five times higher in prehistoric societies. In tribal societies, war was a daily occurrence - just the process of everyone settling down into large-scale governments, even violent ones, was an improvement. If

our hunter-gatherer ancestors could see us now, they'd be confounded by the complete lack of annual head smashing and face stabbing (if you ever unfreeze a caveman, show him our violent video games - he'll go nuts for that shit).

And it's not just war, it's all violent deaths - in 14th century England, some cities had a homicide rate as high as 110 per 100,000 citizens. London's homicide rate in 2012 was just under 1 per  100,000.  And  we've  previously talked  about  how  violent  crime  is dropping to historic lows, even in the gun-crazy USA. No matter how you break it down, violence is slowly going out of style.

## #4. Teen Are Less Likely to Smoke, Drink, or Do Drugs Than Ever

It feels like we've been steadily losing the drug war since the day drugs were invented. All we have to show for it are a  pile  of  laughably  ineffective prevention programs like D.A.R.E. and a  grossly  misguided  attempt  to imprison everyone who has ever sold or ingested narcotics. When will we ever  learn  that  if  the  kids  want  to smoke the methamphetamine, they're going to do it?*

*Neither Cracked.com nor its parent company endorses the smoking of methamphetamine by children.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse has been surveying tens of thousands of  high  schoolers  for  almost  four decades, and not only is drug use down, but almost every form of substance abuse is down.

The  big  exception  is  marijuana; otherwise usage of illicit drugs by high school  students  has  been  steadily falling for seven years. And weed's growing popularity is hardly surprising, as the drug inches closer and closer to legality and is generally viewed as not a big deal by pretty much everyone under the  age  of  65  without  a  law enforcement mustache. It's a far cry from the bath-salts-induced zombie apocalypse that the media would have us believe is around the corner.

And not only are the kids not injecting hardcore narcotics any more, they're also consuming alcohol at record lows, as binge drinking continued its five- year decline right into 2012. Or maybe we just can't tell, because those shiftless teenagers are just butt-chugging their booze. But probably not.

Oh, and as of 2012, teen smoking was at its lowest rate in history.

Holy shit, it couldn't be that all of those  shrill  PSAs  and  after-school specials  actually  worked,  could  it? Actually, it just appears that, for today's kids, their anti-drug is weed.

## #3. We're Getting More Tolerant

Yes, America is a country in which half a  dozen  states  still  celebrate Confederate History Month, dedicated to  the  memory  of  a  government founded on the principle that God ordained one race of people to enslave another race of people. And yes, every few months a racially charged story will dominate  headlines  (see:  Trayvon Martin),  so  maybe  it's  not  too surprising that nearly half the country believes race relations are getting worse. Hell, just read the YouTube comments under any video that has a black person in it. Or even better, don't.

If compared to an ideal world free of prejudice, the current state of things is a shameful walrus orgy of a disaster. If compared to the actual world at any point in the past, things look pretty damn good.

For example, in 2013, 87 percent of Americans  surveyed  approved  of interracial marriage. Just 50 years ago, over  90  percent  of  Americans disapproved. And while only 8 percent of  U.S.  marriages  are  between members  of  different  races,  that happens to be an all-time high. And, despite its reputation as a bastion of backward  rednecks,  Americans  are more likely  to  accept  neighbors  of different races than are the citizens of most other countries.

'Well that's great, but what about gay marriage? That's still illegal in most of the country.' That's true, and opinion polls are split right at 50-50, depending on whose polling you trust. But while half the country opposing a person's right  to  contractually  chain  him  or herself to another seems like bad news, you again have to see how far we've come - that 50 percent approval is up by over 20 percent from the mid-1990s alone. That's a huge turnaround just since the Clinton years.

This is evidently all because of the kids. Most measurable indicators suggest that  the  younger  generations responsible  for  our  future  are increasingly tolerant and open-minded (perhaps it's  all  the  weed?).  Maybe people can change. Or, more likely, old bigots aren't immortal and are replaced with more tolerant infants every day. Either way, the arrow is pointing up.

## #2. Literacy Is at an All-Time High

Seriously, who the hell reads anymore? Go break into a random teenager's room and you won't expect to see a single book, right up until the moment the SWAT team hauls you away. The kids these days always have their hands full with an iPhone, an iPad, or a game controller.  Angry  Birds  and  Candy Crush  have  replaced  Tolstoy  and Hemingway. However you want to say it, people don't read anymore, because there's an app for that, and it's called movies, TV, and porn.

First, we need to point out that we live in  the  most  literate  world  ever. Currently,  about  99  percent  of American adults can read and write. But that's America - a better question would be how the rest of the world is doing.  The  answer  is  also  pretty impressive. Take India, for example, and its 1.2 billion people. Fifty years ago, only 18 percent of them could have enjoyed the Twilight saga. Today, over 60 percent of the country can enjoy literature's greatest love story. Worldwide as a whole, that figure is 84 percent.

So what are people doing with these new  reading  powers?  At  least  one survey suggests that nearly twice as many Americans are reading novels today compared to 60 years ago. Unlike the imaginary ideal 1950s living room, Mom and Pop weren't seated 'round the fire exchanging copies of the New Yorker and ruminating on the works of Fitzgerald or Steinbeck. In reality, they were probably listening to the radio and  talking  about  how  great segregation is.

Oh, and those kids with their noses buried  in  some  Internet-capable gadget? They're not just playing games and watching One Direction videos they're reading. Hell, how could a site like  Cracked  ever  get  this  popular otherwise? Somebody's reading this stuff, we're sure of it. And you know what else they're doing? Writing. At a mind-boggling rate. Posts on Facebook, Tumblr, message boards, Twitter - it all adds up to what they call the 'new literacy.' Think about it - for most of recent history, written communication like that was reserved for the classroom. When our ancestors left school, only a tiny fraction ever wrote anything again besides the occasional letter, so English classes were thought of in much the same light as calculus classes today - a bunch of crap that most of us will never need again. Not so now.

All of that practice - informal as it is really adds up. And given the need for brevity in texts and on Twitter, many of us are almost capable of concisely articulating ourselves.

#1. Worldwide, Poverty Is Dropping at a Shocking Rate

For  decades  now,  we've  watched commercials that feature some retired actor  stumbling  through  some impoverished  village  in  some undisclosed location to make viewers feel  bad  enough  to  donate  money. Considering  that  we're  mired  in  a worldwide recession, it's a sensible question: 'Does any of this even make a difference?'

Yes! Even though lately it seems like the whole world is in a race to the bottom, the poorest of the poor are actually climbing out of the financial shithole.  From  1990  to  2012,  the number of the world's extreme poor was  cut  in  half.  In  case  you  were wondering,  that  would  be  the  first significant global decline in extreme poverty.

Ever.

Not bad, right?

And these aren't just statistical tricks here  -  when  they  calculate  this, they're not just counting income, they account for total living conditions infrastructure, schools, access to clean water, everything. A billion people have that stuff for the first time. And what's really  encouraging  is  that  this  all happened three years ahead of the official estimates, which pegged 2015 as the soonest such a lofty goal could be achieved.

previously  isolated  countries  in international trade. You know how people are always complaining about how  'they're  shipping  our  jobs overseas!' Well, this is where they went - to people who previously had no jobs at all. And that boom that swept across China  and  India  is  expected  to continue in places like Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and Rwanda - all of the places you previously only heard about in the context of heart-breaking ads begging  for  donations.  If  things continue at this pace, countries like Nepal and Bangladesh would likely see extreme  poverty  shrink  to  nearnonexistent levels.

Now obviously anything having to do with the economy is subject to change, often abrupt ones that occur seemingly at  random  (for  instance,  China's economic explosion is due to slow down soon), but we're keeping our eye on the overall  trend  here.  And  it's looking like as many as 40 countries might be able to eliminate extreme poverty within a few decades.

So we know it's hard to see it in the daily  wash  of  awful  headlines  and celebrity scandals, but it's undeniable: We're slowly getting this 'civilization' thing figured out.
