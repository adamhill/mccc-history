## The Latest

Another holiday season runs up to bite  us  in  the  ass,  preceded  by  a shopping promotional rush that keeps pushing  earlier  and  earlier  until 'Christmas in July' will actually be an accurate assessment given a few more years. At least we have a few things going  on  in  the  Amigaverse  this season.

First off, A-EON Technology and ACube Systems are partnering up to develop and promote new Amiga systems over the coming years. Both companies have developed interesting new hardware over the last several years over a wide range of capability, so it should be worth keeping an eye on them to see what comes next. Second, Google, heavy hitter in the Internet tech world (and candidate in the  upcoming  election  for  Big Brother) showed their portable native client  technology,  which  makes emulation of other computers and operating  systems  possible  (and hopefully easy) through their Chrome web browser. Of particular interest is one of the supported systems is the Amiga 500. Check these pages later for more info as it is gotten.

Finally, not long before I write this, MorphOS version 3.4 was released. The primary improvements seem to be video card related, such as faster drivers for R300 chip cards,faster video playback on G5 systems, and support  for  non-native  screen resolutions on Powerbook laptops. There's also a handful of the usual tweaks, bug fixes. and improvements. Of note is a new password lock for the screen blanker. It's not a big deal, but it is a small step to remedy the fact that system security in MorphOS (and  most  Amiga-type  operating systems)  is,  aside  from  its  own obscurity, lacking. I have yet to install and try out the new OS. but I should have it available at the December meeting on my laptop.

Over the last several months, I have recounted  the  Marvelous Misadventures of My MorphOS Mac, AKA  my  quest  to  set  up  a  G5 Powermac with MorphOS and have it take over for my aging Pegasos II system. I'm proud to say, as the year draws to a close, the task is mostly complete. My G5 system is in fulltime use, and the Pegasos, while still ready to go, is used less. There are still misadventures to be had however. I recently bought a USB scanner which I currently can't use on any of my Morph systems, as I didn't realize the driver  had  not  been  ported  yet. Hopefully that is just a matter of time, possibly with a bit of prodding. I like to remain confident that Santa will bring me a driver - or the Easter Bunny will, or Santa in 2014, or…

I  know  many  of  us,  including members of our own group, have largely moved on from Amiga, and even the newer Amiga-styled systems, to some flavor of Linux, or Mac, or mobile  systems,  or  even  (urp) Windows. Perhaps this holiday season it's time to give back to the machines that brought us through all those years ago. You don't have to buy a new piece of hardware or software for your Amiga, though it's not totally out of the question. The most sincere gift you can probably give is your time. Fire up your old systems, play the  old  games,  enjoy  the  classic software. If that's not available, fire up an emulator (or Google Chrome even). If you're lucky, you might just recapture a bit of that warm feeling of nostalgia and a system that was there for you in ways the fancy new stuff never quite managed. Good Luck to you all. Merry Christmas, Happy  New  Year,  and  Good Amigamas to everyone.

## The Amiga 500 Lives Again

Welcome to the Amiga ramblings of the Veep.

Let's start out with the news for AmigaOS, MorphOS, AROS and the EMU communities.

Well sort of… This would seem to work for Chrome.

Google  developer  Christian Stefansen, has brought out a web app that emulates the A500 in Chrome. I haven't actually tried it since I don't have Chrome. You would seem to need a working kickstart ROM as well. There was a comment that it supposedly  runs  on  OWB  with Chrome extensions… although I wasn't sure if that was a joke since it said OWB 3.26 and the latest is only 1.21.  One  user  reported  both Lemmings  and  Dark  Castle  run smoothly on it. It sounds like mostly gamers are interested in this so far.

This leads us to the next bit of news. OWB 1.21 was just  released  for MorphOS. OWB has been updated to  WebKit  r155188  which  was

Amiga 500 Emulator

A Portable Native Client demo released October this year. Life has been sort of nailing me right and left still and while I have downloaded this I have not installed it just yet. This one touches  on  many  sections  of  the Browser. The Core, GUI, Media player, Networking, Spellchecker and Scripts have all seen changes. This of course means lots of fixes and new features as well as some new and possibly old bugs. With luck this will be ported to both Amiga and AROS soon. I'll have more on this when I get a chance to work  with  it.  Also  for  MorphOS PowerSDL was updated to version 16.0b just a few days ago. This would seem  to  be  a  small  but  important update.  The  smpeg.library  used  to trash OpenGL context used in the main powersdl.library.

This is now fixed.

Elbox Computer has announced some new hardware which will be out  in  February  of 2014. The 'TurboFlyer 530' is a 030, 40Mhz internal expansion that plugs into the 68000 processor socket of the A500/500+ and A2000. This seems to come with mixed feeling for many. Elbox has a bad reputation for handling with both Consumers and Developers rather poorly as well as code that  would intentionally  trash RDBs. The other thing is price. The suggested price is 240.00 EUR (excluding VAT). That's about 330.00 USD plus shipping. While I sound rather negative on this I'm not really sure how I feel on it. I do have an A2000 that could use this. It has many nice features, including 16MB 32-bit dram on-board (1 MB going to Chip I think), an integrated FastATA CF/SATA controller and support  for  drives  over  127GB. Nothing  to  sneeze  at  but  still  not something I will rush out for either.

For  you  emulation  fans  out  there, WinUAE 2.7 was released the 5th of this month. Many new features and bug fixes including 'SCSI tape drive emulation'  so  you  can  back  up everything  with  software  that supported it. That seems to be more for the folks across the pond that loved tape drives I guess.

Now then for those that hadn't heard My A1200 has joined me in falling down  and  going  boom.  For  the A1200 it's just the old 20G Maxtor drive that has quit. I had gotten a 160G IDE for not too much and I have  established  that  it's  OK. However the A1200 refuses to boot from it if I have better than 2 500M partitions. It goes into a rolling reboot. After a bit of looking I saw that the Amiga's file-systems had problems over 127G. Trying again I found a nice 80G again for not too much and tried again. Again the drive seems fine.

However I also get the same  results.  The system tries to boot, the monitor shows a signal is sent, and then it reboots only to do so again and again. I can't even  seem  to  boot with a 500MB and a 3.5G. I haven't given up just yet here. She will live again! Why? Because I did still use her. If any of you have an idea of what I've forgotten here please let me know.
