## Shifting Paradigms

Barely a day before this article was written, the long-anticipated version  3  of  MorphOS  was officially  released,  adding  a handful  of  new  features  and applications,  not  the  least  of which is support for the late Mac G4 Powerbook models, giving a desired mobility to MorphOS (and  non-emulated  Amigacompatible operating systems in general). There are a few things held back for a future revision, which  would  help  make  the laptop support more valuable, such  as  3D  support  on  the Powerbook  video  card,  and wireless network support. Still, I'm happy to finally see (a few) Mac laptops supported, as it affords  me  the  ability  to demonstrate  MorphOS  and Amiga software at meetings in a way far more convenient than lugging a desktop system and monitor across town. Expect a demonstration of exactly that for July's meeting.

Previously I've written about 'The Future Was Here,' the book that  examines  the  Amiga hardware and its place in the world. Like just about anything, the Amiga was a product of the time  that  spawned  it.  Some things that are advantageous for one  era  or  generation  can become a hindrance in another. As I read though the book, one recurring thought came to mind, and that thought is 'I miss the eighties.'  I  say  this  because, looking back, the 1980s was kind of an 'anything goes' time for home  computing,  with  the middle of the decade having a wide bunch of eight-bit systems giving  way  to  the  sixteenand-beyond-bit  generations, descendants of which are still primary players today. By around 1985 we had the Apple Mac, IBM PC, Amiga, Atari ST, and a handful of other next-generation systems from around the world filling  up  the  decade.  Pretty much any of them at the time had an equally viable chance to become the ruling system of the future. If pure technical ability for price were the only yardstick, the Amiga might have been most likely to come out on top. Still, as early as 1990, it was becoming clear the Windows PC would be the dominating force, thanks partly  to  its  modular  and abstracted  hardware  and software design, especially the factors which resulted in nearly unlimited clone manufacturers competing  and  flooding  the market with inexpensive systems. Other hardware platforms and operating  systems  survived through  the  decades,  if  not thrived exactly, but 'the PC' was the obvious winner, to the point

where  most  other  available choices are pretty much the same basic PC hardware with a different operating system 'shell' on top.

It's only in the last handful of years that paradigms may be shifting  in  such  a  way  to endanger  the  Win-Tel stranglehold,  at  least  in  the consumer arena. It wouldn't take  that  much  further development  for  the smartphone and the tablet to take over for the majority of things the average consumer might use a computer for, and the  more  demanding applications  of  professional work might not be that far off either. I know I'd like to get into graphic  work  on  a  system  I could hold like a sketch pad, for example.

Sorry for missing out on the June meeting, and hopefully an appearance  by  the  latest MorphOS  version  can  help make it up for next time. I'll see you then.

## Wi-Fi of the Future

## Scientists Create Wi-Fi That Can Transmit Seven Blu-ray Movies Per Second

If you think your home Wi-Fi connection is fast, think again. Scientists have been working on a new  way  to  transmit  data wirelessly,  and  they  can  now transfer a scorching 2.5 terabits of information per second.

Let us put that another way: that's over  8,000  times  faster  than Verizon's  fastest  wired  home internet connection, FiOS, that only manages a paltry 300Mbps. Or, to put it in real terms, it's the same as transmitting seven full Blu-ray  movies  per  second. Basically, this shit is crazy fast.

But how the hello do they do it? Well, the team of American and Israeli researchers have used a neat  new  concept,  where  the electromagnetic  waves  that usually carry data are twisted into vortex  beams.  ExtremeTech describes the concept well:

These  twisted  signals  use orbital angular momentum (OAM) to cram much more data into a single stream. In current  state-of-the-art transmission protocols (WiFi, LTE,  COFDM),  we  only modulate the spin angular momentum (SAM) of radio waves, not the OAM. If you picture the Earth, SAM is our planet spinning on its axis, while OAM is our movement around the Sun. Basically, the breakthrough  here  is  that researchers have created a wireless network protocol that uses both OAM and SAM.

The  combination  of  the  two provides  some  amazing possibilities.  So  far,  the researchers, from University of Southern California, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Tel Aviv  University,  have  twisted together eight data streams, each operating at 300 Gbps, to achieve the new record of 2.5 terabits per second. At the moment, they've only transmitted signals as far as 1 meter. That should be scaled up before  long-though  the researchers admit 1 kilometer is probably an upper limit.

What's perhaps most interesting is that the technique can be used to twist together an awful lot of slower data connections. The researchers, who have published their findings in Nature , explain that  in  theory  it  should  be possible  to  twist  together hundreds or even thousands of conventional LTE signals into a single beam. That ought to help address the impending bandwith crisis.

Of course, all that remains is for the  team  to  develop  the technology  into  something robust  enough  to  use  on  a commercial scale-and there's no telling how long that might take.
