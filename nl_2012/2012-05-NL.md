## Thoughts on Jack Tramiel

There was a notable obituary in the computer world recently. Perhaps equally notable is that his passing was marked with barely a percentage point of the recognition Steve Jobs received upon his death, despite being an equal or greater influence to the world of personal computing in his heyday. That  person  was  Jack  Tramiel, founder  of  Commodore  Business Machines, and father in a sense to the biggest-selling single computer model of all time, the Commodore 64. Much of  his  career  was  known  for  two principles-a  basic  belief  that computers and technology should be affordable and available to as many people as possible, and the business savvy mixed with dirty ruthlessness to make it happen. Often associated with slogans  like  'computers  for  the masses, not the classes' and 'power without  the  price,'  Commodore machines were generally cheaper than their contemporaries (sometimes in the 'inexpensive' sense, occasionally in the 'shoddy' sense) and utilitarian yet capable. The approach worked, especially with the VIC-20 and C-64, which quickly outsold the competition, and forced them to adapt.

Tramiel  was  forced  out  of Commodore in 1984 after butting heads  with  Irving  Gould  and  the board one too many times, in no small part  because  it  was  apparent  Jack intended to eventually install his sons in  high-level  positions  within  the company. Not long after, he bought the struggling Atari home game and computer  division  from  Warner Communications and managed to turn it around, with the concepts for what would become the Atari ST already on the  drawing  board  before  all  the papers  were  signed.  The  Tramiel tenure at Atari was a moderate success, but  with  no  'big  hits'  like  the Commodore 64, perhaps because the market  was  already  beginning  its seemingly  inescapable  shift  to DOS/Windows and 'PC' domination by then.

I made a comparison to Steve Jobs earlier, and it's interesting to see the similarities. Both had very strong (yet different) beliefs about technology and business. Both were forced out of companies they founded, and had to find their fortunes elsewhere. Both had  the  reported  capacity  to  be terrible pricks to anyone who got on their bad sides. Perhaps if Jack had never retired, and was the workaholic charismatic public figure Jobs was, perhaps he'd be the one getting the lion's share of the press. He seemed happier working behind the scenes though, and is remembered fondly as a holocaust survivor, family man, and the boss behind the biggest success of the 8-bit home computer era.

It's hard to say exactly how much of an impact Mr. Tramiel had on our favorite computer, the Amiga, but you definitely can't say none at all. Jack had already left Commodore before the Amiga corporation became part of it.  When  Amiga  was  looking  for capital, they borrowed from Atari (still with Warner at the time) with the contractual expectation the Amiga tech would go to Atari either by sale or by default. Amiga spoke with Jack during his 'transition period' between Commodore and Atari, and he made it  clear  he  was  interested  in  the technology, but not the company or the  people  behind  it.  When  word came down that Tramiel would be the new head of Atari, the Amiga people started scrambling for money and courting what they hoped would be better  buyers  than  a  Tramiel-run Atari.  As  we  know,  Commodore swooped in at the last minute before the Atari contract was up and paid off the loan, supposedly nullifying the contract. Jack didn't exactly see it that way, (and was more than happy to get back at the company that booted him)  and  sued  Amiga  and Commodore for breach. The suit was eventually settled, but it did hold back Amiga development a bit. When the Amiga was finally brought to market, a primary direct competitor was Atari's 520ST computer, pushing heavily on a lower price and (slightly) faster clock speed.

With  a  story  like  this,  you  can definitely say Jack Tramiel had an effect on Amiga in its formative years, and there's plenty of 'what if' points where if Jack had taken another path we might have seen a different path for Amiga as well. Perhaps the Amiga would  have  become  an  Atari computer  or  game  console  if someone other than Jack was holding the reins. Perhaps it never would have come to fruition at all. Even if Commodore may not have turned out to be the best 'mother hen' for the Amiga and its engineers, it's hard for me to speculate a situation where the Amiga fares much better than it historically did, so perhaps we can thank Jack Tramiel for all his indirect influence, seemingly mostly in the Amiga  engineers'  desire  to  avoid working under (or being fired by) him.

## Commodore OS Vision

It's been way too long since my last article. I'm sorry. I'm happy to say that I have a reason to write this article: Commodore OS Vision. All I can say is 'WOW.' I had no idea that this project even existed until a friend sent me a link on the new Commodore Mini which came as a shock too. Perusing the Commodore site led me to the Vision operating system and download link.

## What is Commodore OS Vision?

Maybe up front I should say what it is not. It is not in any way, shape or form related to any Amiga operating system. None. What it is is another version of the the Linux operating system finely tuned  by  Commodore  USA.  They don't  try  to  hide  the  fact  that  this started  as  Mint  with  a  Gnome  2 windowing system-Tweaked. Think of it as if Commodore never went out of business and kept releasing cuttingedge desktops to this day. Imagine comparing 1985 Amiga OS 1 to MSDOS. Out of the box, all the graphics tweaks are turned on for the latest graphics cards. Features I have not seen the like of on Win7 yet. Granted, there are plenty of Linux distributions out there but this one is by far the most luscious, visual, feature packed release I have seen yet. Like most other offerings now, you have the option to boot up the system and try it without installing it.

The next shock was the size of install, 2 full DVDs. The problem was the only way  to  get  the  downloads  was  by torrents. At home the download speed was averaging 1 Kbps-weeks to get. Unfortunately at the university peer to peer downloads are highly discouraged. I  talked  to  a  sysadmin  friend  who stated that torrents are OK if you limit the  number  of  connections  to  40, which I used. The transfer started off slowly  enough  but  after  several minutes  the  speed  increased  and ramped up to 5.5 megs per seconds and bits were flying. Once dialed in, the second DVD image took mere minutes  and  freshly  burnt  disks  a couple of minutes after that. I couldn't wait to get home and decided to try it on my work machine-dual core i5 with decent ATI Radian card, 4 gigs of RAM. It ran flawlessly the first time and  the  responsiveness  was  much greater than what I was accustomed to on Win 7. Linux programs that I love were  already  in  there,  very  useful system tools unknown to me included.

## Problems

Very few problems so far. Booting up the system, if you don't have a 64 bit machine, the boot loader just sits there and  does  nothing,  acts  locked  up. Having used Linux for several years now, I knew to reboot, hit the tab key and  change  the  word  'quiet'  to 'verbose' in the boot arguments. Only then did it report that a 64 bit machine was necessary. I tried it on a P4 2Ghz laptop I had only to find out it was not 64emt capable. I ran and got my Eee Atom netbook and prayed for results. No deal there either.

Another bit of a gripe I had was what to do with the second DVD disk. The install made no mention of it. Looking on  the  disk  did  not  reveal  any README files or any documentation as to what to do with the disk. I finally just  got  on  Google  and  searched. There it directed to go to the Menu bar  (on  the  top  Ed,  where  God intended it) and sure enough, there was  a  command  to  install  the Commodore  content  which  went smoothly, quickly, correctly. I have not had time to do it yet, but there are commands in the system to install purchased Amiga Forever software and old 8 bit Commodore software. YES! A few gigs of old Commodore music and demos were installed.

## Last thought

I have to get to bed and haven't gone through this drivel. All I can say is that Vision is awesome. It will very likely become my main machine distribution very  soon.  Of  course  from Commodore a system would come together that works like I do with the graphics things that interested me in the original Amiga. Hell, this is even a Deluxe Paint clone in it.
