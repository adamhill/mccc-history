## Wi-Fi LED Light Bulbs

October 22, 2012

In the future, we're told, homes will be filled with smart gadgets connected to the Internet, giving us remote control of our homes  and  making  the  grid  smarter. Wireless thermostats and now lighting appear to be leading the way.

Startup  Greenwave  Reality  today announced that its wireless LED lighting kit is available in the U.S., although not through  retail  sales  channels.  The company, headed by former consumer electronics executives, plans to sell the set, which includes four 40-watt-equivalent bulbs  and  a  smartphone  application, through utilities and lighting companies for about $200, according to CEO Greg Memo.

The  Connected  Lighting  Solution includes four EnergyStar-rated LED light bulbs, a gateway box that connects to a home  router,  and  a  remote  control. Customers also download a smartphone or tablet app that lets people turn lights on or off, dim lights, or set up schedules.

Installation is extremely easy. Greenwave Reality sent me a set to try out, and I had it operating within a few minutes. The bulbs each have their own IP address and are paired with the gateway out of the box, so there's no need to configure the bulbs,  which  communicate  over  the home  wireless  network  or  over  the Internet for remote access.

Using the app is  fun,  if  only  for  the novelty. When's the last time you used your  iPhone  to  turn  off  the  lights downstairs? It also lets people put lights on a schedule (they can be used outside in  a  sheltered  area  but  not  exposed directly to water) or set custom scenes. For instance, Memo set some of the wireless bulbs in his kitchen to be at half dimness during the day.

Many  smart-home  or  smart-building advocates say that lighting is the toehold for a house full of networked gadgets. 'The thing about lighting is that it's a lot more  personal  than  appliances  or  a thermostat. It's actually something that affects  people's  moods  and  comfort,' Memo says. 'We think this will move the needle on the automated home.'

Greenwave  Reality  intends  to  sell through utilities and service companies. While gadget-oriented consumers may be attracted to wireless light bulbs, utilities are interested in energy savings. And because these lights are connected to the Internet,  energy  savings  can  be quantified.

In Europe and many states, utilities are required to spend money on customer efficiency programs, such as rebates for efficient  appliances  or  subsidizing compact fluorescent bulbs. But unlike traditional CFLs, network-connected LEDs can report  usage  information. That allows Greenwave Reality to see how many bulbs are actually in use and verify the intended energy savings of, for example, subsidized light bulbs. (The reported data would be anonymized, Memo says.) Utilities could also make lighting  part  of  demand  response programs to lower power during peak times.

As for performance of the bulbs, there is essentially no latency when using the smartphone app. The remote control essentially brings dimmers to fixtures that don't have them already.

For people who like the idea of bringing the Internet of things to their home with smart  gadgets,  LED  lights  (and thermostats) seem like a good way to start.  But  in  the  end,  it  may  be  the energy savings of better managed and more efficient light bulbs that will give wireless lighting a broader appeal.
