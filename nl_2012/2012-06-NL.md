## NASA's $5 Solution

How NASA Solved a $100 Million Problem for Five Bucks

A  few  years  ago,  back  when  the Constellation Program was still alive, NASA engineers discovered that the Ares I rocket had a crucial flaw, one that could have jeopardized the entire project. They panicked. They plotted. They  steeled  themselves  for  the hundreds of millions of dollars it was going to take to make things right.

And then they found out how to fix it for the cost of an extra value meal.

The problem facing Ares 1 wasn't a booster malfunction or a computer glitch. It was simple cause-and-effect physics. During the final stages of a launch, as the solid booster rocket burns down it makes the entire vehicle oscillate rapidly. Add that oscillation to the resonant frequency of the large tube that separates the booster and the crew cabin, and you get a crew capsule that vibrates like crazy. When humans are  vibrating  to  that  extent,  it's impossible for them to read a digital display. If the astronauts can't read, they can't do their jobs. If they can't do their jobs, no more mission.

To evaluate the extent of the problem, NASA called in its Human Factors Division. They're the ones who study human perception and performance, from  very  basic  research  to  very applied research. In fact, they were the ones who had done the most recent round of vibration tests: 50 years ago, for the Gemini project, back when displays were analog, steam-actuated dials  and  gauges  instead  of  the computer screens of today. Cockpits, like everything else, have changed a lot since those days. It was time for some new tests.

Step one was to set up a chair so it would vibrate purely in an up-down motion (or in-out, if you're lying on your back like an astronaut would be), which is how the launch vehicle was predicted to shake. The vibrational frequency of the rocket would be 12 hertz  (on  average,  but  it  would fluctuate between 10Hz and 13Hz) so they needed something that could hit that  range  exactly.  Luckily,  that technology already existed; the same mechanism that causes your chair to shake  in  simulation  rides  at amusement park made for a perfect prototype.

The engineers also knew that as Ares I gained speed the shake would increase. They calculated that toward the final stage,  when  astronauts  would  be already  subjected  to  4  G's  of acceleration, they would be getting an additional 0.7 G's of vibration. As NASA slowly ramped up testing in the chair, they discovered that at 0.7 G's even  the  largest  numbers  on  the digitized display were almost entirely illegible.

Houston,  we  have  a  major  effing problem.

Plans were drawn up to reduce the vibrations. Spring and counter-firing motors.  Hundreds  of  millions  of dollars to implement. Added years of development and implementation. A nearly insurmountable setback.

And then the people in the Vibration Lab had a really, really good idea: By simply strobing the display in time with the vibration, they could kill this problem altogether. They bought a handful of circuits that only cost a few bucks, hooked them up to the screen, and set it to strobe at 12Hz. And it worked!

Well, almost.

The readability was vastly improved, but it wasn't perfect. The chair was vibrating at 12Hz and the screen was strobing at 12Hz, but they weren't perfectly in sync. The text was more visible, sure, but it looked like it was swimming around. NASA could do better.  So  they  grabbed  a  few accelerometers and attached them to the chair. With the vibration and the strobing now perfectly in sync, the display became crystal clear. And the final cost was a fraction of a fraction of  a  fraction  of  what  they'd anticipated. Victory.

If it sounds too simple to actually work, believe me, I felt the same way until I saw it with my own eyes during a recent visit to NASA Ames. My guides were only willing to take me up to 0.5 G's, but even at that rate the smallest  column  of  numbers  was completely illegible. As soon as they flipped on strobing? I could see it perfectly. The effect was stunning. We  did  our  best  to  show  the before/after by putting our camera on  the  sled,  but  the  imagestabilization was just too damn good (well  played,  Sony.  Well  played). You'll have to take my word for it.

Because  it  was  also  important  to know if the system worked while vibrating and feeling the real, facemelting  G-forces  that  astronauts experience, NASA's big brains have incorporated  a  similar strobing/vibrating rig into the iconic G-force simulation centrifuge. They wouldn't let me anywhere near that thing  without  all  kinds  of  medical evaluations.  Begging,  bribery,  and tearful  theatrics  proved  ineffective. Maybe someday.

NASA has a patent pending on the technology, although the problems it solves  are  decidedly  not  NASAspecific; helicopters, planes, and fastmoving boats have similar vibrational issues, so it's very possible we'll see this implemented elsewhere. I just want to sync my TV up to a shiatsu massage chair. Nobody blurs my Beyonce.

So while the the Ares I rocket has been grounded,  there's  no  question  this research  will  live  on  and  be implemented in NASA's next launch vehicle. It's nice to know that the next generation of astronauts will be able to see  what  they're  doing,  and  that  it didn't cost the tax-payers hundreds of millions of dollars. Good deal.

## Another Power Grab

Media Minutes for March 23, 2012 Producer:  Stevie  Converse,  Megan Tady, Candace Clement

Verizon has joined forces with a cadre of cable companies, including Comcast, Time  Warner  Cable  and  Cox,  in  a controversial deal that would divide up the broadband market.

Verizon is vying to buy $3.6 billion in unused  spectrum  from  the  cable companies to expand its own network. Giving up the spectrum means cable companies  will  back  away  from investing in the wireless market. In return, Verizon has agreed to lay off of cable companies' turf by not building out  residential  broadband  fiber networks.

Josh  Levy,  the  Internet  campaign director  for  Free  Press,  said  the companies should be rivals, but instead are  helping  each  other  corner  their respective markets.

Josh Levy: Verizon won't compete with the cable companies anymore, and the cable companies won't compete with Verizon anymore. It's kind of like the five families in The Godfather getting together and dividing up territory. This is pretty much  what  Verizon  and  these cable companies have done.

In  addition,  the  companies  have proposed a cross-marketing agreement to sell each other's services to their customers,  further  solidifying  their dominance.  Verizon  is  already  the leading wireless provider in the country.

Levy said the deal is bad news for the public  because  it  would  stifle competition.

Josh  Levy:  If  you  live  in  a community  that  has  one  cable broadband provider and you've

It's not going to do that anymore. You are going to be stuck with that cable provider. And that cable provider might not be willing to build out into underserved areas. It might not be willing to provide prices that are affordable to all residents. And so a lot of people who  have  been  stuck  with inadequate access or no access are still going to be stuck.

The deal has already raised eyebrows in Congress.  The  Senate  Antitrust Subcommittee held a hearing this week to discuss the deal. And the Federal Communications Commission asked the  companies  to  submit  further details on the arrangement.

Levy said public outrage is growing against the deal.

Josh  Levy:  Big  broadband companies  like  Verizon,  like AT&amp;T in the past, rather than try to innovate and serve customers through better service and better prices, instead make these power grabs. They can own even more of the market, charge us even more and  get  around  the  need  to provide better service and greater choice.
