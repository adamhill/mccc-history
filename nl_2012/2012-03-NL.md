## Thoughts on SOPA

First off, I'd like to wish a happy Greeting Card Companies Day to all  those  who  had  reason  to celebrate. Now with that out of the way, I'd like to expound a little about  the  recent  'Internet  IP protection' bills SOPA and PIPA. The  measures  to  curb  on-line piracy endorsed by these bills were considered  too  draconian  by pretty  much  everyone  who understood how the world with an Internet in it works, and did not directly benefit from their passing. Many high and low-profile web sites  protested in favor of the defeat of the bill either by urging people  to  write  their representative or going 'on strike' for  a  day  or  so,  and  the congressional debate became toxic enough that the bills were shelved 'indefinitely,' which is slang for the backers (such as the motion picture association) waiting until no one's watching to try again. While some declare their victory over  the  forces  of  evil  and censorship,  ACTA,  the international treaty counterpart, is making its own bid. ACTA is not quite as big a deal in the US as SOPA or PIPA, as it supposedly mostly  enacts  regulations  we already have as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Agreement (DMCA) internationally, but it's still forcing change and potentially curtailing rights, and being hand- led in such a back-door way that we may not be know exactly how much it does until it's actually in place. The Internet is prone to hyperbole, but then so are the media conglomerates that back these bills, so the situation is never black or white, and there may be no such thing as a 'right' answer.

As I frequently work as a 'content provider' and manage my own websites,  I  know  that  on-line piracy can sting, and I fully believe that creators should be adequately compensated for the work they do. On one end of the debate you have  the  philosophical  pirates, those that say that all information, entertainment, and the like should be  free  to  all,  and  trying  to monetize  it  or  claim  property rights is inherently wrong and stifling to the spirit of the Internet. More often you'll see the practical pirates, who basically just don't wanna  hafta  pay  for  stuff. Sometimes they're honest about the  situation,  sometimes  they justify or rationalize their actions with arguments that come off as idiotic  when  digital  data  is replaced with tangible objects ('I wasn't going to buy it anyway, so it's  OK.').  To  be  fair,  digital piracy has the distinction of not depriving the previous owner of their property. I'm often surprised by the sense of entitlement seen in some of these people, calling for others to share or pirate a given thing so they can have it (roughly equivalent to asking a stranger to buy them something) or becoming belligerently indignant, screaming about  their  own  rights  and freedoms when the IP owners take action to get in their way. They're no saints, that's for sure. However,  on  the  other  side there's the big corporate content providers who treat every loss to piracy with far more value than it probably actually deserves. They are  the  types  who  created software license agreements and digital  rights  management schemes that claim that even if you paid for your digital data, (and  the  physical  object  that contains it it's not necessarily 'yours' and you can't just copy or use it however you like. These types are all for giving someone years  of  jail  time  for  illegally sharing $13 worth of music, and shutting  down  any  and  all Internet  sites  which  might contain any amount of their unpaid-for  digital  property, regardless of how it happened. They don't exactly sound saintly either. Neither side represents a majority, but just like in politics, those  on  the  extremes  battle, while the 'regular folk' just trying to get by in the middle are caught in the crossfire and probably end up getting hurt the most.

As I've mentioned, I've worked in Internet and digital content, and I've  been  affected  by  piracy, directly and indirectly. As such, there is a temptation to do all possible to prevent piracy, and punish the offenders to the fullest extent. There have even been times when I've considered taking preemptive action against potential piracy, which is basically punishing someone on suspicion that they might do something they haven't done yet, with the goal of keeping it  from  happening,  'Minority Report'  style.  That  might  be justifiable if we're talking about murder or terrorism or something, but this is just unauthorized filesharing. It's clear there's a line here l don't want to cross, in no small part  because  I  wouldn't  want others crossing it, least of all the entities with the power to pull it off  effectively.  While  I  believe piracy and file sharing is a problem, and damages to many creators and producers, the legal steps the 'big guns' like the MPAA endorse are at least as damaging. For example, bills like SOPA and PIPA (or at least certain drafts) mention that a given site can be shut down or blocked on a copyright complaint without the due process required currently.  Presumably  this  is presented as a 'stop them before they do even more damage while the courts drag their feet' measure, but it could just as easily be a 'shut down something we don't like and tie them up with red tape until they die'  to  anyone  with  means  to abuse the system. That's probably not the intent of the bill [Editor's note: I'm not convinced of that.] , but a lot of vigilance would be required

to  make  sure  some  person, politician, or business doesn't fling an IP infringement complaint at some website that bad-mouthed them,  just  to  shut  them  up. Speaking of vigilance, these bills are said to make sites and service providers liable for what their users do,  kinda  like  prosecuting  the managers  of  a  shopping  mall because two shoppers were found conducting  a  drug  deal  in  the restroom. This is undoubtedly to go after file-sharing sites like the recently-defunct  Megaupload [Editor's note: Megaupload was shut down without the help of new legislation.] , or all the copyrighted material on YouTube and elsewhere, and a much stronger measure than the 'We deal with whatever is reported to us' used now. I'm not sure how viable it is for any web service to screen  all  things  uploaded  by thousands to millions of users for possible copyright infringement (not  to  mention  trademarks, patents,  and  other  IP infringements), but regardless it puts a much greater burden on Internet businesses to keep their houses  clean,  which  is  still  no guarantee against an occasional slip-up or an abuse of power.

The big problem with all these things is that the Internet is the Internet, and its nature (and the pirates)  can  never  be  totally

MCCC      4418 Sharpsburg Drive      Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org controlled,  as  much  as  some lawmakers would like to try. The harder you push against the tide, the harder the tide pushes back through any opening. It seems the best defense against piracy is the paradigm shift. While things such as the Itunes store and the 'app economy' don't stop piracy, it has made finding and buying a given bit of digital music or video or program more convenient (and not that much more costly) than trying to track down the right file for  free.  It  seems  likely  some partially-watered-down version of these  IP-protection  bills  will eventually pass into law, which hopefully will be not so severe as what we've seen earlier. I wish it could  all  be  dealt  with  using common  sense,  and  claims handled on a case-by-case basis. Unfortunately, common sense is in terribly short supply in law and politics, and law is more about absolutes than handling each case differently. I suppose the best (if unlikely) option are laws that make sure the pirates and the moneygrubbers at the extremes are both equally unhappy, while the regular folk in the middle of the battlefield get the better of the deal.
