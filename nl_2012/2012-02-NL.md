## Stop SOPA and PIPA

I just posted a blog post on the MIT Media Lab blog officially taking a position against SOPA and PIPA. This is a longer blog post co-authored  with  Ethan  Zuckerman describing the issue in more detail.

SOPA - the Stop Online Piracy Act and a sister bill, PIPA - the Protect IP Act - seek to minimize the dissemination of copyrighted material online by targeting sites that promote and enable the sharing of copyright-protected material, like The Pirate Bay. While this goal may be laudable, entrepreneurs,  legal  scholars  and  free speech  activists  are  worried  about  the consequences  of  these  bills  for  the architecture of the Internet. At the MIT Media Lab, we share those concerns, and we oppose SOPA and PIPA as threats to innovation on the Internet.

To limit access to rogue sites, SOPA and PIPA would:

- supersede the 'notice and takedown' method of policing for copyrighted material  on  Internet  services  and require service providers to police content uploaded by users or prevent users  from  uploading  copyrighted content
- require Internet Service Providers to change their DNS servers and block resolution of the domain names of websites in other countries that host illegal copies of content
- require search engines to modify their search  results  to  exclude  foreign websites that illegally host copyrighted material
- order payment processors like PayPal and ad services like Google AdSense to cease doing business with foreign websites that illegally host copyrighted content

Major  internet  companies,  including Google,  Facebook,  Twitter  and  others, oppose  SOPA  and  PIPA  because  it changes the liability rules around copyright infringement. Under the Digital Millenium Copyright  Act  of  1998,  companies  are protected from charges of 'contributory infringement'  on  content  uploaded  by users, so long as the company follows a procedure and remove infringing content when an alert process is followed. SOPA substantially alters this system, and internet companies worry that without protection from  contributory  infringement,  usergenerated content sites like YouTube and Twitter would not have come into existence. The burden of reviewing user-submitted content - every blog post, every video, every image - would be impossible for a company to manage, and companies would have likely stuck with the Web 1.0 model of publishing edited, vetted content instead of moving to a Web 2.0 model where users create  the  content.  Several  internet companies took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to express their concerns about SOPA and PIPA.

Free speech advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, worry that SOPA may provide powerful new tools to silence online  speech.  Confronted  with uncomfortable political speech, repressive governments often seek to silence dissent by  reporting  content  as  defamatory, slanderous or copyright infringing, hoping the  companies  hosting  the  speech  will remove the content. SOPA accelerates the process  of  copyright  removal,  with  a mechanism that permits copyright holders to obtain court orders against sites hosting copyrighted materials and have those sites rapidly  blocked.  Scholars  of  online censorship, like Rebecca MacKinnon at the New  America  Foundation,  worry  that SOPA may be popular with the Chinese government as with the copyright holders who are lobbying for the bill.

US  law  already  permits  the  seizure  of domestic domain names that are used for piracy, and the US seized 150 domains in November. SOPA is an attempt to enforce copyright provisions across international borders by prohibiting American internet users  from  accessing  certain  foreign websites, like The Pirate Bay. In effect, it would create a firewall to prevent users from  accessing  prohibited  intellectual property, much as China's 'great firewall' limits  access  to  politically  sensitive information.

Harvard  legal  scholar  Lawrence  Tribe believes  that  SOPA  is  likely unconstitutional,  as  it  can  remove constitutionally protected speech without a hearing, a form of 'prior restraint.' In a memo sent to members of Congress, he points out that SOPA proposes a system where  a  single  instance  of  prohibited material could lead to the blocking of thousands of unrelated pieces of content.

Internet  experts  have  observed  that, beyond being dangerous to innovation, harmful  to  speech  and  potentially unconstitutional, SOPA and PIPA are unlikely to work. Countries that block access to prohibited websites by altering the domain name system - as Vietnam does in blocking access to Facebook find  that  millions  of  users  are  able  to circumvent  this  form  of  censorship. Millions of Vietnamese users have become Facebook users by entering that site's IP address into their browsers, or configuring their  computers to use an uncensored DNS server. It's likely that dedicated US users of The Pirate Bay and other sites will do likewise. Effectively blocking access to sites like The Pirate Bay might require US ISPs to install powerful and expensive 'deep packet inspection' software, a cost that would inevitably be passed onto their users.

The progress of the bills was slowed in late 2011  by  widespread  online  activism opposing SOPA and PIPA. Hearings are likely  to  resume  early  in  2012,  and opponents  of  the  bills  are  facing  off against organized lobbying campaigns by the music and film industries who support the legislation. On November 16, 2011, participatory media company Tumblr took strong  online  action  against  SOPA, redirecting requests for content on the site to  a  page  that  urged  users  to  call  US representatives  and  oppose  the  bill  their daylong campaign generated more than 87,000 calls to Congress. Internet community site Reddit plans a site-wide 'blackout' on January 18th to inform users of the potential harms of SOPA and PIPA. Wikipedia is considering doing the same.

In  the  spirit  of  these  protests,  the  MIT Media Lab has linked this blogpost to all our site pages, encouraging anyone interested in the work we do to learn more about SOPA and PIPA. More information and resources follow below. We believe that SOPA and PIPA would make it harder for Media Lab students, researchers and faculty to do what we do best: create innovative technologies that anticipate the future by creating it. We hope you'll join with us in opposing these bills and, if you are a US citizen, in letting your representatives know your concerns about this legislation.

## SOPA  Not Done Yet

Internet opponents of a pair of controversial Hollywood-backed copyright bills won a temporary reprieve today, when upcoming votes  in  the  Senate  and  House  of Representatives were postponed. But the lobbyists and politicians backing the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, and Protect IP haven't given up.

'We must take action to stop' online piracy and counterfeiting, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said today. Reid, who previously called the Protect IP bill an 'extremely important' piece of legislation, said he believed it could move forward 'in the coming weeks.' (See CNET's FAQ on SOPA and today's Reporter's Roundtable.)

Reid's comments came after this week's historic online protest - Wikipedia going dark for a day, alerts appearing on the home page of Google.com and Amazon.com roiled  Washington  officialdom  and obliterated long-held assumptions about whether  it  would  be  politically  safe  to advance a measure opposed by millions of Internet users.

The danger for the anti-SOPA contingent is that, over time, when this week's outcry recedes into memory, Hollywood and its allies will regroup around a new bill with a different name but only a slightly different approach. The Motion Picture Association of America may have lost this round, but dozens of U.S. senators are still publicly applauding the idea, and, if history is any indication, the MPAA is willing to wait.

'I expect this threat to resurface,' said Jerry Moran  of  Kansas,  the  first  Republican senator to oppose Protect IP.

And some of Hollywood's closest allies are promising  that  will  happen.  Protect  IP 'deserves  to  be  considered,'  Sen.  Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said today. Protect IP's author, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said he hopes 'to send a bill to the president's desk this year.'

For  its  part,  the  MPAA  sounded unapologetic  and  unrepentant.  'As  a consequence of failing  to  act,  there  will continue to be a safe haven for foreign thieves (and) American jobs will continue to be lost,' MPAA Chairman Chris Dodd said in a statement this morning. (Dodd, clearly not  a  reliable  prognosticator,  initially dismissed the protests as 'stunts.')

The  unrepentant  tone  was  shared  by  a collection of groups including the American Federation  of  Musicians,  the  American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the Directors Guild of America, and the Screen Actors Guild. They said in a joint statement  that  critics  of  the  legislation offered an 'onslaught of mistruths' to the public.

SOPA, said that he would delay a vote on his legislation - but warned that it was only  a  delay.  The  House  Judiciary Committee 'remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation,' said Smith, who counts Hollywood  as  the  top  donor  to  his campaign committee.

Copyright  Alliance  Executive  Director Sandra Aistars said today that 'the status quo is unacceptable.'

Aistars, whose group counts as members the MPAA, the Business Software Alliance, News Corp, and CNET parent company CBS  Corporation,  said  'meaningful remedies  for  independent  artists  and creators [are needed] to effectively combat the mounting problem of rogue Web sites.' Aistars did not respond to a request from CNET asking for an elaboration on what 'meaningful remedies' meant, and whether that included attempting to block allegedly piratical  Web  sites,  one  of  the  most controversial sections of SOPA and Protect IP.

Of course, wanting to enact legislation isn't the same as actually possessing the political muscle  to  pull  it  off.  And  the  sheer numbers involved in this week's protest the FightForTheFuture.org advocacy group calculates  that  more  than  13  million Internet users were involved in one way or another - will surely make politicians leery.

On the other hand, the most significant impact of Web site blackouts comes with the initial one. The first time Wikipedia goes offline, it's a historic moment. The second  or  third  or  fourth  time,  it's  an annoyance.
