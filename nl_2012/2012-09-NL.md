## 802.11ac Gigabit Wi-Fi

Theoretical Max Throughput Heads to 1.3 Gbps

Although it may seem like just yesterday  that  the  final specification 802.11n devices started  rolling  out,  there  is already  another  Wi-Fi specification right around the corner, 802.11ac. As of current specifications, 802.11ac provides wireless throughput rates of at least 1Gbps. However, recently announced devices from Netgear promise  theoretical  rates  of 1.3Gbps.  All  of  this  is  in comparison to 802.11n, which tops  out  at  a  maximum throughput of 450Mbps.

802.11ac, in contrast to 802.11n, uses only the 5 GHz band. This is done because the 2.4 GHz band  cannot  support  the bandwidth  required  for  the 802.11ac specification. 2.4 GHz has only three non-overlapping 20 MHz wide channels in its WiFi specification: 1, 6, and 11. 802.11ac's newfound throughput comes  from  using  80  MHz channels  as  opposed  to 802.11n's maximum of 40 MHz (and even that 40 MHz can cause problems  on  the  2.4  GHz frequency).

The  move  to  the  5  GHz frequency allows for the use of those 80 MHz wide channels to provide  the  aforementioned throughput  rate  of  1.3Gbps. There is also the possibility for using 160 MHz wide channels to provide  up  to  2.6Gbps throughput rate. However, it remains  to  be  seen  if  using channels that wide will come with  some  of  the  same limitations of using the 40 MHz wide ones with 802.11n.

The  benefits  of  faster throughputs don't just stop at being able to transfer large files quickly  across  your  wireless network or streaming heavy HD content to devices because, let's face it, if that were the case, most people would be content with their  current  802.11n  setups. Allowing more bandwidth means that  there  will  be  less interference overall resulting in more  effective  coverage  and fewer dead zones.

Netgear  is  also  including  a technology called 'Beamforming' with their draft 802.11ac device. Beamforming simply means that instead of the wireless signal transmitting  in  an omnidirectional pattern at all times, it will intelligently direct the signal toward a device.

As was stated earlier, Netgear is preparing  to  launch  the  first

802.11ac wireless router in the second half of 2012. The good news?  It  will  be  backward compatible with 802.11n at the 5 GHz band. The bad news? There are no receiving devices on the market yet - meaning you  won't  be  able  to  take advantage of that new speed until there are devices such as phones, etc. that have the new 802.11ac chipset inside. The retail price of Netgear's new device is set at $199.99.

Keep in mind though that early 802.11n draft devices were not compatible  with  the  final specification.  I  know  many people that got burnt buying pre-draft  802.11n  devices because they thought that they could be upgraded when the final specification came out. Just something to keep in mind.

## Amiga Badmouthing

Like a lot of Amiga enthusiasts, I periodically visit websites like Amiga-dot-org,  though  it's frequently an annoying, if not outright frustrating procedure. It's not the sites themselves, but the  users.  There  are  the argumentative and the trollish, and a few just plain jerks. That's nothing out of the ordinary, and easily  found  pretty  much anywhere on the Internet. What I find more bothersome personally is the shift in attitudes regarding Amigas by the site posters-at least taken as an average. I find frequent bad-mouthing of the Amiga platform, classic and recent, blue or red, seemingly regardless of  variation.  There's  nothing wrong  with  criticism  and realism-I know as well as any that  even  the  most  modern Amiga-based operating systems don't reach the same capacity and software support of Windows. Mac, and Linux machines, but I don't go belittling those who use 'lesser'  systems  for  whatever reasons they want (at least not any more). This is an increasingly common practice on the websites though. Anyone who talks or asks about using Amiga / Morph / AROS for any kind of 'serious' usage is subject to criticism, even insults, for bothering to do so by those who imply pointlessness to the endeavor, and the platform itself.

I struggle to grasp exactly why so many take this attitude when they are supposedly Amiga users and fans themselves. Assuming they are not just trolls trying to stir the pot,  my  best  guess  for  this phenomenon is an increase in the percentage of site posters whose Amiga usage is primarily retro and gaming  based,  or  primarily emulation  as  opposed  to hardware  usage.  An  Amiga interest limited to very specific areas  can  produce  a  similarly limited view of the platform. I know  it's  an  easy  attitude  to develop-I've had the same sort of thing myself on occasion. I used to look down my nose at those people who worked to graft things such as USB support or Internet browsing to old 8-bit Commodore and Atari systems. I wondered why they bothered when  easier  options  were available,  just  as  others undoubtedly wonder the same about anyone who might use an Amiga or clone system when a Windows  machine  would  be easier in a 'keeping up with the world' sense. Being on both sides have helped me to understand it's a  matter  of  preference  and finding enjoyment in what you do and what you use, and if someone is satisfied with what they have it's  not  my  place  to  tell  them they're wrong.

There are more and more people out there as computer platforms lose their identity to commodity status  who  might  never understand, and that's a pity in itself. So if you have to deal with some  on-line  presence  who spouts  that  Amiga  (or  any platform for that matter) is crap because  it  doesn't  run  some flavor-of-the-month  game  or application or web page, feel free to  pity  their  inability  to appreciate the barebones musclecar experience while they tool around in their smooth, soulless sedan with the touch-screen in the dashboard. Or something like that.
