## Amiga Multitasking

There are a few bits of minor news in the Amiga-related worlds, mostly in the  MorphOS  realm  this  month. Outside  that  realm,  the  book 'Commodore: The Amiga Years' has been  pushed  back  to  January. Hopefully it shan't be pushed back any further. Back to the Morph realm, new versions of the vector drawing program Steam Draw, along with an update  to  the  'Ultimate  Pack' MorphOS software compilation. The R300 video card found in supported Mac G4 Powerbook systems has been 'fast-tracked'  for  3D  support  in MorphOS,  thanks  to  donations. Hopefully wireless networking isn't far away either. Also, a bounty has been set up to port MorphOS to G5 Powermac  (a  specific  model,  but hopefully the CPU support will enable a spread across at least a few G5 Mac models).  Best  of  luck  to  those working these projects, and any who may benefit from them.

Continuing my examination of details from the Amiga past, this month I'll write about the multitasking OS. The Amiga operating system was a true first, being able to multitask, or run multiple programs at the same time, on a consumer platform. (QDOS, for the Sinclair QL came before, but was not very successful.) The only other multitasking systems available at the time  then  were  large  business  or institutional machines running UNIX and similar operating systems that helped inspire the Amiga OS. Even in later  years  when  multitasking operating systems were common, the Amiga  OS  stood  out  by  its  low overhead and ability to get by with less  memory  or  drive  space  than others.

The  Amiga  used  what  was  called preemptive  multitasking,  run  by system software called Exec. In such a system, programs divide the available CPU resources according to their priority  when  actively  running,  as opposed  to  waiting  around  for  a button or key to be pressed, or some other event to happen. Programs that make  heavy  use  of  the  CPU  are usually given a lower priority. This might seem counter-intuitive, but it helps insure that one program does not monopolize the whole system, turning it into an unresponsive block. The biggest pitfall of the multitasking system  is  that  problems  arise  if different running programs step on each others' toes. If two programs try to access the same block of memory or use the same system resources at once,  it  would  cause  errors  and confusion at best and bring down the entire system at worst. Because of this, Amiga programs had to be especially well-behaved to multitask. They had to ask permission from the system to use memory and other resources, and properly give them up when finished using them. It's almost like an internal bureaucracy.  This  took  time  and practice for programmers to get used to. Early on the Amiga took on a reputation for being crash-prone as the programmers worked out how to do things properly. In games, where speed and performance trumped all else, multitasking was usually tossed out along with most of the operating system,  as  negotiating  for  system resources would eat up too much time and processor cycles for 1980s game programmers.

Over the years, Windows PCs and Macs would try to catch up in the

Multitasking game. Early efforts were clumsy  compared  to  the  Amiga, either  'task  switching,'  where multiple programs could be open at once but only one could actually run, or 'cooperative' multitasking, where programs had to agree to share time and resources, often failing to do so. Instead  of  actively  allocating  or releasing memory as needed, Mac programs often had to have their total memory usage set at start, which led to problems when the estimates were poor. Eventually Windows (NT and 95) and Mac with OSX achieved full preemptive multitasking as well, thanks in no small part to standard availability  of  processors  with included memory management units, which let the hardware do most of the hard work making sure different software  tasks  not  step  on  each others'  toes  memory-wise.  The Amiga started losing its multitasking advantage around this point, though having no real parent company didn't help either. Amiga made better use of smaller  amounts  of  memory  and drive space than the others, but that became less important over time as larger amounts were available for less. Amiga OS always had a stability issue, as  it  relied  on  all  the  software  to behave, and any rogue task could conceivably take the system down with it. With the hardware support of an MMU, it became easier to shut down  a  bad  program  without  it becoming  a  system-wide  issue. Because the Amiga OS came from a time when MMUs were too pricey for consumer computers, it didn't have this luxury. Actually it could have if it did what Windows and Mac did. Their multitasking OS releases broke  a  lot  of  older  software  or weren't backward-compatible at all, and  they  relied  on  the  software publishers to release new versions for the new system. Since Commodore was gone by 1994 and Amiga software publishers dropped like flies not long after,  major  everything-breaking changes were not really an option.

Sadly this carries some of the instability over to successor systems with Amiga legacy software support, such as Amiga OS4 and MorphOS. They do as much or  more  to  be  rock-solid  stable  as Amiga  OS  did  before,  even  with MMU-aided  CPUs,  but  errant  old software can still cause problems as long as Amiga backward compatibility is needed to pump up the available software library. Sadly it's become a fact  of  life  for  us  Amiga-andcompatible users. We might be less bulletproof than the big UNIX-derived consumer operating systems of today, but  we  were  there  running  all  our software at once damn near a decade before  they  were,  and  they're  still hardly  perfect  (or  completely bulletproof either, no matter what they say).

## The Titan Supercomputer

Cray's  Titan  supercomputer  has snatched the title of world's fastest from the National Nuclear Security Administration's  Sequoia-and  it's Cray fast, as you might expect.

and 16-bit computers, including the Vic-20, Commodore 64, Apple II, and game consoles such as the Atari 2600, Nintendo  Entertainment  System, Game Boy and more. Inspired by classic video game soundtracks and electronic music from the 70s and 80s, 8 Bit Weapon delivers a sound that is as unique as it is original. They have performed their chip music across two continents using their arsenal of classic video  game  consoles  and  vintage computers as instruments.

After 14 years, 5 tours, many studio albums, and countless live shows 8 Bit Weapon has amassed a healthy body of work.  Multiple  albums,  singles, remixes and rare demo tracks make 'The 8 Bit Weapon Collection' a must for  any  fan  new  or  old.  Even  the holiday album with Michelle's solo band ComputeHer is included in the collection! You can sample all the tunes and purchase this collection over at 8 Bit Weapon .

Powered by a mixture of CPUs and GPUs, Titan is home to 18,688 nodes, each of which contains an AMD 16core Opteron and a NVIDIA Tesla K20X GPU accelerator. All told, that's a whopping 560,640 processors, which are  capable  of  17.59  quadrillion operations per second. For perspective, Sequoia snatched the top spot back in June with a mere 16.32 quadrillion.

And  what  the  hell  is  all  that computational crunching power used for? Well, Titan is housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where it's used to perform  calculations  for  materials research, nuclear energy research, and analysis of techniques which can make combustion engines more efficient. As well as dabbling in climate modeling. No biggy, then, obviously.
