## The C-One Computer

The C-One computer started off as a 2002  enhanced  adaptation  of  the Commodore  64  -  the  most-sold computer model (Guinness book of World Records). While retaining almost all  of  the  original's  capabilities  the Commodore  One  adds  modern features, interfacing and capabilities. The C-One fills a gap in the hobbyist computer market.

During development, it evolved into a re-configurable computer, a new class of computers where the chips do not have dedicated tasks any more. The two main chips carry out different tasks, depending on the needs of the program. The technology used is called FPGA - field programmable gate arrays.  These  chips  can  be programmed to do the tasks that the chips of the C-64 or other computers have done. It's no emulation, but it's a re-implementation of the chips that are no longer available since many years.

After a cold start, the FPGA programs (also called 'cores') are loaded from a mass-storage device like hard-drive or a compact flash card. What's described in one short sentence is a giant leap in computer technology: The hardware can be altered by the user without even opening the computer. The FPGA programs - so-called 'cores' - turn the C-One into clones of famous 80's computers  like  the  C-64,  VIC-20, Amstrad/Schneider CPC and even the Amiga. It can, of course, also be a completely new computer with specs yet unknown, as developers can alter the hardware on their own. A good example of that is a turbo-CPC that is a lot  faster  than  the  original  CPC computer,  while  still  maintaining compatibility to the old machine.

The price is 333, - EUR, including a CPU/RAM  card,  a  72-pin  SIMM module and the FPGA extender card that  allows  running  the  Amiga 'minimig' core. The user will need to supply an ATX style case, ATX power supply, drive(s), PS/2 keyboard, mouse and  VGA  capable  monitor.  The monitor should be able to sync to vertical frequencies of 50 Hz in order to display certain core's output. Please check your monitor's specifications and read the disclaimer before you buy!

## C-One Demo

[MCCC Members: Please note that this demo is taking place in Dayton, not DFW. I have included the article here because I thought the information was of interest.]

I hope to have a very interesting demo for the next meeting. I'm doing my part to stimulate the economy - the economy  of  Germany,  that  is.  I decided  to  bite  and  purchased  the extension board that will allow my COne computer to become an Amiga 500. What should have been a straightforward process took a fair amount of effort on my part. I believe I wrote in the last newsletter that I contacted Jens from  Individual  Computers  and received no reply. I tried again a week later and did get a response. It appears that  Jens  released  a  number  of computer boards to dealers that have not  paid  for  them  yet.  Jens  claims ownership of those computers and will not ship extension boards to those 'caretakers' that have them in their possession. My job was to prove to Jens that my C-One was purchased from a reliable dealer. My problem was that I purchased it 2 nd  hand on EBay and Jens never felt the need to put serial numbers on any of his boards which  made  identification  rather difficult.  He  also  requested  some photos to be sure that board was of a late enough vintage to be able to be upgraded.  Well,  simple  things  like shooting  some  pics  that  look acceptable end up eating large amounts of time and this was no exception. Jens also  requested  that  I  contact  the person I bought the machine from in the fall of 2007. Anyone who has spent some quality time on EBay will know that  this  is  a  dubious  undertaking wrought  with  peril.  To  my  utter surprise. I received a prompt response that I just forwarded (more peril) to Jens. After more 3 way conversations, Jens was satisfied enough to take my money ($$$s not Euros please!) and ship  me  the  product.  I  was  really hoping to have it by now and if I don't have  it  by  the  meeting,  I  will  be entering Damage Control Mode.

The  new  extension  board  has  me stoked. First of all it has energized the small C-One community and that has resulted in some big upgrades to the system. The first that you will come into contact with is a new bootloader called NewBoot. Newboot is lightning fast and allows an unlimited number of cores to be installed on a CF card. This is  great because it allows for more experimentation. Some cores, like the 16-bit color picture viewer, include the picture into the hardware data. To view another picture requires loading a completely new core, The old bootloader, BigBoot, only allowed 10 cores which I had filled already. A gentleman by the name of Peter Wendrich has taken it upon himself to document the inner workings of the C-One board to encourage more core development. I printed out the first draft to find out a second was just released. I should have that  printed  out  for  the  meeting. Finally  some  serious  literature  to complement the pin-out diagrams and hardware programming listings.

The plan is to demo an emulated-inhardware Amiga 500 with 11 megs of RAM, a hard drive and CD-ROM. That is, if I can get the board and work out all the bugs by Saturday. If not, I will demo the  C-One  computer  running  8-bit hardware like the Vic20, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC in a couple of variations. Hopefully I can remember how  to  run  the  SymbOS  for  the Amstrad, which is a very impressive multi-tasking operating system with a full GUI that reminds me of GEOS. There  is  also  a  new  core  called Chameleon, which is advertised as a reverse-engineered C-64 with a 2 meg memory upgrade. Yummy.

Honestly, this programmable hardware is cutting-edge stuff and it's pretty cool that the Commodore people are taking a lead in developing it. It's also hard to explain and I've only touched some of the high points so far. Best to see it in person.

## AMIT Vintage Computer Fair

The Arlington Museum of Information Technology (AMIT) is sponsoring the first  annual  Vintage  Computer  Fair Light  -  South,  to  be  held  in conjunction  with  The  15 th annual Antique Science &amp; Retro-Tech Show And Swap Meet. The combined event will be held Saturday, March 14, 2009 at the Ramada Hotel, Irving, Texas, 4440 W. Airport Freeway, from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. Admission is $5.

AMIT Director Gil Carrick said that this combined event should attract many visitors who are interested in displaying their vintage computing artifacts or in buying, selling, swapping or just seeing these artifacts. Vintage Computer Fairs have been held in other parts of the country, but this will be the first one in the South. Since this is the first of these events in the region, it will not feature any speakers and will only last one day hence the term 'lite.'

Antique Science &amp; Retro-Tech Show And Swap Meet organizer Skip Solberg said that for a decade and a half the event has been a favorite spot for fans of this antique gear to show, sell and swap their stuff.

Visitors interested in displaying or selling should contact Skip Solberg at 817-9949213 or email solberg2@airmail.net for pricing and availability of table space.

If you'd like more information about the Retro Tech Meet, or to talk with Skip Solberg, please call 817-467-0368, email solberg2@airmail.net or see the web site at  http://www.slideruleguy.com/tx1q09.htm.

## March Calendar

March 4 - Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter 7:00 pm - South Grand Prairie Library 760 Bardin Road, Grand Prairie

March 4 - MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approx 9:15 pm - Location TBD

March 28 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am

MCCC   P.O.Box 813    Bedford, Texas 76095    http://www.amigamccc.org and  free  project,  aiming  at  being compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 at the API level (like Wine, unlike UAE), while improving on it in many areas. The source code is available under an open source license, which allows anyone to freely improve upon it.

The goals of the AROS project are it to create an OS which:

1. Is as compatible as possible with AmigaOS 3.1.
2. Can be ported to different kinds of hardware  architectures  and processors, such as x86, PowerPC, Alpha, Sparc, HPPA and other.
3. Should be binary compatible on Amiga and source compatible on any other hardware.
4. Can run as a standalone version which boots directly from hard disk and as an emulation which opens a window  on  an  existing  OS  to develop software and run Amiga and native applications at the same time.
5. Improves upon the functionality of AmigaOS.

To reach this goal, we use a number of techniques. First of all, we make heavy use of the Internet. You can participate in our project even if you can write only one  single  OS  function.  The  most current  version  of  the  source  is accessible 24 hours per day and patches can be merged into it at any time. A small database with open tasks makes sure work is not duplicated.
