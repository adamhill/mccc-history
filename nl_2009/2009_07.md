## Two Types of Users

A while back I read an article talking about the "death" of Linux on the desktop. Naturally there are a lot of dissenting  opinions.  mostly  from people who use Linux on a daily basis on their desktop machines. When I read the article, it was pretty clear what the author's definition of "death" was. The author was referring to the likelihood of the "average person", or more  accurately,  the  computerilliterate  to  choose  Linux  over Windows or Mac operating systems. I can  understand  that  view  within those constraints, though the "date of death" was set around 2002 or some such. Personally, I saw a chance at life for Linux a year or so back, when the small "netbook" laptops were the new big thing. Linux was making some substantial inroads in that arena, as it was better suited to the smaller memory and drive footprints of those little  machines  than  Windows. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for the Linux-based netbook to be all but murdered by Windows, though it had to be more with XP than Vista.

Based  on  the  "regular  person" guidelines  of  the  article  writer,  I would set the death of the Amiga platform  somewhere  in  the  midnineties, between the bankruptcy of Commodore and the bankruptcy of Escom. Perhaps that seems harsh, but again we are talking about the general public here, not people who know all  about  computers.  Sadly, while the Amiga and its relations, including  MorphOS,  AROS,  the various hardware projects, and more, may survive for years to come, it's unlikely they will ever be on the radar of the general public ever again. I guess if some think Linux is already off the public consciousness, what chance does the Amiga have?

The basis of all this talk is the idea that there are two types of people in the  world  of  computers  and operating systems - the ones who know something about computers and  the  ones  who  don't  (and probably don't care to). Way back, way way back, the vast majority of computer users were the first type, largely  because  computers  were somewhat demanding, and you had to learn something about them just to use them, and to decide which to buy among  all  the  available  platform choices. Nowadays, computers are a commodity, and like any appliance most people don't really care about its workings or attached brand name as long as it does what they want it to do adequately. That's one of the big reasons why Windows and Mac are the big names today - both excel at doing the basics (Internet, games, managing  media)  with  a  relative minimum of fuss from the user. Each has advantages in certain areas, but it all works out about the same if one doesn't sweat the details. Linux can do the basics about as well as the others, with the added benefit of the bulk of the available software being free, but even with lots of advances in  ease-of-use,  Linux  still  often requires its users to have a bit more on the ball compared to Windows or Mac.  One  has  to  pick  among  a million-billion different variations for one.  Linux  has  a  very  strong following among the "people who know  something."  Putting  it  to serious application, or at least putting more thought into its use beyond "Can I read my email and play MP3s with it?" The Amiga family is more than capable of handling the basics of  Internet  and  futzing  around, though the available software and support is not quite there.

What  made  the  Amiga  unique throughout its life is it's always been about more than simply doing the basics, whether it was graphics and gaming in the old days to desktop video to just the enjoyment of a simple yet powerful operating system. That may have kept the Amiga and its descendants from the mass appeal of its peer systems, but it also made it something special in the eyes of the "people who know something" who could appreciate it. Even with all the various systems I've used over time, the Amiga family is the only one that's been special to me over the last couple of decades - above and beyond the "basics," that is.

## Broadband Penetration

A new broadband survey out from Strategy Analytics shows the US in 20 th   position  when  it  comes  to household  broadband  use,  well behind countries like South Korea, Singapore, and the Netherlands.

The report focuses on broadband penetration by household rather than by person. Many other reports use a per-capita broadband measurement, but Strategy Analytics says that those reports are simply using the wrong data.

- "In  far  too  many  cases,  people  are looking at the wrong things," said Strategy  Analytics'  Ben  Piper.
- "Residential  broadband  is overwhelmingly  consumed  on  a household basis - not individually. Reporting broadband penetration on a per-capita basis misses the mark, and can provide grossly misleading results."

Using this metric, South Korea tops the list; 95 percent of South Korean households  have  a  broadband connection. No one else comes close to that figure, either. The number two spot on the list is held by Singapore, which  has  88  percent  household broadband penetration.

The  US,  with  a  mere  60  percent household broadband penetration, is in 20 th  position on the list. Strategy Analytics estimates that the US will fall to 23 rd  place by the end of the year.

Here are the top 20 countries and their respective household broadband percentages:

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; South Korea (95%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Singapore (88%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Netherlands (85%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Denmark (82%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Taiwan (81%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Hong Kong (81%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Israel (77%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Switzerland (76%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Canada (76%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Norway (75%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Australia (72%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Finland (69%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; France (68%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; United Kingdom (67%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; United Arab Emirates (65%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Japan (64%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Sweden (63%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Estonia (62%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Belgium (62%)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; USA (60%)

To  what  does  Strategy  Analytics attribute  the  phenomenal  Internet saturation of South Korea? "Its highly urbanized population, as well as to the existence  of  a  comprehensive government-backed broadband policy."

The  Federal  Communications Commission is currently drafting such a plan for the US.

## C=64 Forever: Click to Play

When the C64 was launched in 1982 it immediately set the standard for 8-bit home  computers.  Its  low  cost, superior graphics, high quality sound and  a  massive  64  KB  of  RAM positioned  it  as  the  winner  in  the home computer wars, knocking out competitors from the likes of Atari, Texas Instruments, Sinclair, Apple and IBM.

## July Calendar

July 8 - Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter 7:00 pm - South Grand Prairie Library 760 Bardin Road, Grand Prairie

July 8 - MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approximately 9:15 pm - Location TBD

July 25 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am

MCCC   4418 Sharpsburg Drive    Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org

Selling  over  30  million  units  and introducing a whole generation to computers and programming, the C64  shook  up  the  video  games industry  and  sparked  cultural phenomena such as computer music and the demoscene. In recent years the C64 has enjoyed a spectacular revival manifesting itself once again as a retro-computing platform.

To allow you to experience and relive the wonders of this unique computer, Cloanto,  developers  of Commodore/Amiga software since the  1980s,  has  introduced  C64 Forever, a revolutionary preservation, emulation and support package. C64 Forever embodies an intuitive player interface,  backed  by  a  built-in database containing more than 5,000 C64  game  entries,  and  advanced support  for  the  new  RP2  format, dubbed the "MP3 of retro-gaming".
