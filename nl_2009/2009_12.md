## News!

It's a bit like the old proverb that says you can wait hours on end for a bus, and then three come at once. Almost immediately after I closed the book (so to speak) on last month's newsletter, two major events  happened  almost concurrently.  One  major announcement is that a decision has  been  made  in  the  case between Amiga Inc. and Hyperion, the people currently behind Amiga OS4. I'm not sure of the details, but suffice it to say Hyperion  has  been  given unlimited  license  to  use  and development  of  the  Amiga operating  system  3.1  (the  last version  put  out  under Commodore - the later 3.5 and 3.9 versions are from Haage &amp; Partner). With Amiga Inc. now having no real control over what Hyperion can do with Amiga OS4, they  are  now  officially marginalized in the Amiga venue. (Not that they weren't before, but at least now they aren't holding others back.) Hyperion already started down the road of 'stuff Amiga Inc. doesn't want' a while back, with versions of OS4 for SAM440  and  Pegasos,  and presumably PowerPC Mac Mini at some point in the future. While this court decision is not huge news  in  itself,  it  represents  a milestone,  where  Hyperion became, for all practical purposes, more 'Amiga' than the company that most recently bore that name.

(Who knows exactly what name they are using now.) Perhaps great things will come from them now that they don't have an IP leash attached.

The  other  recent  news  is  the newest release of 'Amiga in spirit' MorphOS, version 2.4. For people who were already using it, this version  isn't  much  more  than tweaks and bug fixes, but the big news here is that 2.4 is the first MorphOS  to  run  on  Mac hardware, specifically the Mac Mini with PowerPC CPU. I have tested  this  out,  booting  the MorphOS install CD on a Mini, and it works fine, at least in the limited way I tried it out. The Morph  team  are  working  to expand the range of supported Mac models. It sounds like EMac will be next, and I (and others) hope  for  ibook/Powerbook support to enable MorphOS usage on a laptop. If that would come to pass, I'd gladly purchase a secondhand laptop and a new MorphOS key file.

## Amiga and Windows

I was looking at the amiga.org web site and I saw a post from a Brit, about windows 7. I must admit  that,  since  I  have  no interest in Windows, I hadn't seen or looked for anything about the new version of Windows. The Writer,  apparently  from Nottingham, England, said, so far, Windows 7 seems to be what the successor  to  XP  should  have been… Windows Plaster 2007 as it should have been called.

I  also  ran  across  something I thought was rather interesting there. Amiga Explorer software makes it possible to access the resources of an Amiga from a Windows  system.  The configuration is simple and only requires a few mouse clicks on the Windows side. It allows a Windows system to copy data to and from an Amiga. It can move, alter and examine Amiga files and information  through  the Windows interfaces. The Amiga side  works  with  all  Amiga computers and is compatible with Amiga OS 4.0 and Morph OS. The  Windows  side  works  on Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server2003, Vista, 7, and Server2008. There is also an 'x64' setup file for use on 64-bit versions of Windows. There are some limitations, so if you are interested in it, check into them. Amiga Forever, adds an Amiga emulation  and  Workbench package if you need them.

I saw a discussion on Amiga.org. about what will drive the New Amiga. While it was strictly a discussion by the participants on

Amiga.org, it got me to wondering if the discussion came up because the word is out that there will be a new Amiga, or if it is strictly a group  of  us  old  Amiga  fans discussing what we would like to see. It would really be nice if we would soon learn that there is soon to be a new Amiga, but I guess I'd better not hold my breath, right? But, I will keep my fingers crossed that someday it will finally happen. I guess I'd better also keep them crossed that I live that long. For now I'll just live with the Amiga web sites hoping to see some good news some day,

## Firefox on the Amiga?

An effort is currently under way to port the Firefox web browser to the Amiga operating system. This effort goes by the name Project Timberwolf, and is the latest in a long line of efforts to port Firefox to alternative operating systems. This raises the question: is Firefox really  suited  for  these  small platforms?

Let's detail the Timberwolf Project first.  It's  a  bounty  over  at AmigaBounty.net, and has been taken up by the Frieden brother who also developed AmigaOS 4. With Firefox, the Amiga obviously gains a modern, well-supported browser that everyone knows. A number of new screenshots have been released a few days ago.

All this does raise the question: is Firefox really the kind of browser you want on a platform like the Amiga? As a BeOS junkie, I recall the days of using Firefox on the BeOS - and trust me, it wasn't (and  isn't)  pretty.  The BeOS/Haiku port of Firefox is stable  and  usable,  but  it  just doesn't feel right.

Firefox  is  a  product  of  the mainstream world, geared towards Windows, with Mac OS X and Linux somewhere in second place. For some reason, Firefox never felt comfortable on a fast, small, and lean operating system like the BeOS, and I'm afraid Firefox for the AmigaOS will suffer from the same problem.

I'm all for undertaking the effort and free will and all, and I'm sure the Amiga world will really benefit, but  is  it  really  something  you should devote time to? Wouldn't it be better to invest the time and effort  into  improving  OWB, bringing it to feature-parity with modern browsers, and integrating it even better with the Amiga?
