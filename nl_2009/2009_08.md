## Amiga Forever 2009 Released

July  2,  2009  -  Cloanto  released today Amiga Forever 2009, the latest version of the award-winning Amiga preservation, emulation and support suite  for  Windows  and  other platforms.

Amiga  Forever  2009  is  the  most refined update ever released in the Amiga Forever series. It again sets new  references  in  usability  while more  than  doubling  the  featured content and providing easier access to a universe of free downloads. Like its sister product C64 Forever, Amiga Forever 2009 introduces a synergistic combination of the RP2 retrogaming file format, RetroPlatform Library to recognize content, and RP2 Manager to export and import to and from other file formats.

The 2009 version includes hundreds of enhancements and was tested to comply  with  'Compatible  with Windows  7'  requirements.  New features include seamless, one-click integration  of  the  AmiKit  and AmigaSYS add-ons and new system ROMs (e.g. the 0.7 Kickstart required to run the software used by Andy Warhol's famous 1985 Launch of Amiga  demo).  The  Plus  Edition includes more than 100 games and a selection from the most beautiful demoscene productions ever created. Tens of thousands of games, as well as other software ranging from the oldest to the latest Amiga releases are only a mouse click apart, and can run on powerful PCs and inexpensive netbooks alike.

When both Amiga Forever and C64 Forever  are  installed,  the  players share data and software modules with each other, uniformly playing back RP2 games of both 8-bit and 32-bit platforms. The same familiar user interface and settings are also applied to saved states, disk write undo, dualmonitor setups and other advanced functionality. 'The way it brings back memories is amazing, and it feels as if Commodore and Amiga were united again,' said Michael C. Battilana of Cloanto.

Dave Haynie, a long-time user of Amiga  Forever  and  former Commodore  International  chief engineer on high end and advanced projects, added: 'The past IS the future… Amiga Forever is the single best  way  to  run  AmigaOS  today. Your PC is the fastest Amiga that will ever  exist,  and  Cloanto  does  a wonderful  job  of  packing  the emulation  technology,  every AmigaOS  ROM  and  Workbench version (most of which I've long since lost to data rot on my floppy collection), games, utilities, Web tools, graphics programs, most anything you would need, all in one place.'

Amiga Forever 2009 is available now in three editions:

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Value Edition (downloadable installer for Windows systems)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Plus Edition (downloadable CD ISO  image  with  additional Windows and platform-neutral content)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Premium Edition (physical Plus Edition CD and two DVDs, plus instant download of the installer for Windows)

The Plus Edition includes the KX Light  boot  environment  with barebone PC hard disk installation and online updates. The Premium Edition additionally contains more than five hours of videos.

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; New system HDFs: complete Amiga  OS  1.3,  2.1  and  3.1 installations with only a minimum of add-ons (e.g. Y2K fixes, RTG update for 3.1), but otherwise identical to the original (including file  attributes  as  intended  by Commodore, which were lost in later distributions)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; New ADFs (1.3 Extras, complete 3.1 install set, etc.)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; New ROMs (Amiga 1000, A590 and A4091 boot ROMs, systemspecific ROMs required for added compatibility, etc.)

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; New KX Light, bootable from CD and with  HD  installation option  (now  featuring  live updates) and extended hardware support

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Professional  skin  design  with familiar 'media player' interface
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Buttons and other visual controls provide intuitive access to content and emulation features (pause, resume,  disk  change,  reboot, joystick vs. keyboard selection, window size selection, full screen, Amiga screen capture, etc.)
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; The new Amiga Forever player makes it possible to double-click or drag-and-drop downloaded disk images (e.g. RP2, ADF, ADZ, IPF,  etc.)  to  play  them,  using heuristic content analysis to preset a  suitable  Amiga  hardware configuration
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; The player has built-in support for dual screens (can use secondary display for full-screen Amiga) and multiple emulation sessions
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Rather than closing an emulation session, it is possible to save its state, for example to resume a game at a later time (the session is up  and  running  again  in  an instant)
