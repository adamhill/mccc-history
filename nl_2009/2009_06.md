## Using My Computers

I've mentioned now and again that I have a wide range of machines that I use on a regular basis, largely for different preferences and applications. My Pegasos 2 running MorphOS is my  primary  graphics  machine.  I might be able to get more ability or performance out of other systems I have, but there's a level of familiarity and comfort with the tools involved here, My Amiga 4000 takes up some of the slack from the Pegasos, mainly running  the  Amiga  software  that doesn't  run  properly  (or  at  all) through the Amiga compatibility of MorphOS. I also have the Mac Mini and the Linux Laptop, both of which are primarily Internet machines with some occasional productivity here and there. Since getting the laptop, it has taken the lion's share of web browsing work, while the Mac does more creative work, usually centered around  specific  applications  like iMovie or Comic Life, and stuff I can't currently do (at least not easily) using the Pegasos or Amiga.

How much each individual machine gets used depends on what work needs  to  be  done,  and  the convenience involved. For a while the Amiga was falling out of favor relative to my other machines, even though I still needed to do work that required it. The reason for this was a paradigm shift. In times past, the floppy  disk  was  the  standard  for moving files between machines (sure, I  could  try  networking  machines together, but I didn't), but it's harder and harder to find a machine with a floppy drive anymore. People often cite things such as the Zip disk, or

CD-Recorders as "floppy disk killers," but in my opinion the true murderer, or at least the final nail in the coffin, is the USB flash drive, being smaller, faster,  larger  capacity,  and  more reliable than the average floppy disk. It's also an extremely convenient way to move files between machines except my USB-free Amiga. As a result,  the  Amiga  wasn't  used  as much as it could have been, since shuttling files on and off the machine required a different, less convenient method than my other machines, like Zip disks or e-mailing files to myself. Later, I was able to procure a Deneb USB  card  for  my  Amiga,  which opened things up and leveled the playing field again. Each machine gets its own rightful slice of my time, as it should be. I'm sure they're all happy about that.

By the way, the newsletter is being put together using the Amiga, in case you'd like to know.

## Ban Community Broadband?

Media Minutes, May 1, 2009 &lt;http://www.freepress.net/files/ MM 5-1-09-Transcript.doc&gt;

Wilson, North Carolina, is a small city of 47,000, located TK miles east of Raleigh. It grew up with the tobacco industry  at  the  turn  of  the  20 th century.  And while tobacco remains, the boom years are in the past, and the city is looking ahead to the new information economy.

Internet service for Wilson had been slow and unreliable. So in 2006, the city  built  a  fiber-optic  ring  that connected city facilities like City Hall, parks  and  recreation  and  town offices  to  super-fast  broadband. After requests from local businesses, the City Council voted to expand the fiber network to the entire city. Brian Bowman  is  the  public  affairs manager for the City of Wilson.

Brian Bowman: We went to Time Warner and to Embarq and said, we would love for you to build a fiber-to-the-premise network in Wilson. Embarq said they wanted to work with us to partner on that. Turned out it didn't  work  out  because  we couldn't  meet  that  middle ground for both of us to work out. And Time Warner just said, 'No, we're not going to do that right now.' So we said, 'Ok, we'll do it ourselves.'

Wilson's network, called Greenlight, is up and running, with connections up to 100 megabits per second which makes it among the fastest service available in the country. The city offers triple-play package of TV, phone  and  Internet  for  $99  per month, every month. That beats Time Warner Cable's package that has fewer channels, slower upload speeds and costs 40 percent more at the start.

After less than a year in business, Greenlight has already signed up more than 3,000 customers. And that  apparently  has  made  Time Warner Cable, Embarq and AT&amp;T very nervous. They've backed a new bill  in  the  North  Carolina  state legislature that would ban the use of certain municipal funds to finance and maintain a broadband network and would cut off local communities from receiving money for broadband from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Brian Bowman: If this bill had been  law  when  we  started, Greenlight would not exist today. It  simply  sandbags  the  cities where it's not possible or practical to do it. That's the effect of the bill.

The bill's sponsors are clearly taking their marching orders from the cable and  phone  companies.  Bowman describes a recent hearing.

Brian Bowman: You know who's in the room with you, and it is a handful  of  private-sector providers who seem to be the ones  who  were  talking  in  the hallways to the sponsors. We saw a person from Time Warner, in fact, hand a note to one of the sponsors during the meeting, and the sponsor then spoke up, so all you know officially is who the sponsors are, but, you know, you can see what's happening in the room.

Bowman says that Wilson is one of those  cities  that  doesn't  have  the population  density  that  makes  it attractive to private industry.

Brian  Bowman:  If  profit  was going to be the motive, we were going to be waiting, potentially, decades to get this critical service, which we believe our businesses need. And right now, we're doing it ourselves, we're having good results,  and  this  law  would essentially  keep  other  cities  in North Carolina from being able to do the same thing.
