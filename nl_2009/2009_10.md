## OS Comparisons

Another month passes, and another meeting approaches. This month I plan to bring in my Pegasos system to show off the latest version of the MorphOS system: 2.3. I don't have any formal presentation planned, but my system and I will be available for showing off and answering questions where possible. Overall I am quite satisfied with the new version of the operating system. There's not a lot new and different about it… mostly fixing some bugs and tweaking to improve the way previous updated features  work.  It  would  seem elements of the graphics system or video card drivers were updated, as I noticed a few differences and some minor glitches  that  I  hadn't  seen before. Nothing that amounts to a real problem though. MorphOS 2.3 can be run on the Pegasos 1, 2, and Efika systems, with a version for PPC Mac Mini and possible other Mac models on the way. Unfortunately the new  Efika  MX  system  is  not supported, as it uses a different CPU. See you guys at the meeting.

Not long ago, I read a few articles on MorphOS and Amiga OS4. One was a  comparison  between  the  two, which largely showed MorphOS as running faster for most tasks on the same hardware. Another was a review of Amiga OS4 on OSnews.com. The review was notable for being written by  someone  with  no  previous experience with the Amiga. It was fairly positive, though it was obvious to  me  (as  someone  with  a  lot  of Amiga experience) that a fair amount of his issues with OS4 stem from ignorance  about  how  Amiga operating  systems  work,  bias  or assumption  that  they  work  like Windows or Mac. For example, he stated  the  system  would  forget window or icon positions, compared to something like a Mac, which will save things where you left them by default The Amiga requires you to 'snapshot' the object positions if you want them remembered (it was a little vague in the comments whether the snapshot function works the same in Amiga OS 4.1 as it did in 3.9 and earlier), which adds a step but gives you an extra level of control to test and check things without committing, or writing to disk if you don't want to. The same goes for preferences and settings, where you can test and use them  temporarily,  or  save  them permanently,  unlike  most  other operating systems. It's not necessarily easier,  but  it's  easy  enough  to understand and make use of the extra control when you get used to it.

I remember years back in college, when I had a graphics class that used Amigas. The instructor introduced the Amigas as 'Similar to Macs, but only enough to confuse you.' After years using a variety of systems, it's become clear that most people prefer what they are used to using, which more often than not is their first system  (or  perhaps  their  first operating system with a graphical interface).  If  that  is  a  Windows system, them's the breaks. Look at all the various flavors of Linux - it's pretty much possible for it to have any sort of interface you want, via any  window  manager  and configuration, but most end up a rather direct copies of the Windows interface, to help current and former Windows users feel comfortable. It doesn't  take  much  to  provoke  a trading  of  insults  between  the

Windows  and  Mac  camps.  I remember clearly in an argument someone called the Mac desktop interface 'retarded' for having the window close button in a different corner than it is in Windows, or for using a 'dock' instead or a 'start bar.' I myself felt much better after configuring the window manager on the Linux laptop into a more Amigalike configuration (because everyone knows having a close button on the right  side  like  Windows  does  is retarded).  It's  a  pity  that  these preferences and designs aren't likely to change soon, at least not before the whole paradigm changes, much like  the  graphic  user  interface changed the game from the text screen and the DOS prompt. Until then, I'll remain a fan of the way Amiga (and its relatives) do things, and  probably  for  some  time afterward too.

## Harwell Computer Restoration

The  world's  oldest,  working computer to reboot after 48 years.

The historic Harwell computer, later known as the WITCH computer, came out of storage last week to travel to The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park where it  is  planned  to  restore  it  to  full working condition. Once restored by the volunteers at the Museum, it will be the oldest original functioning electronic stored program computer in the  world  and  will  be  housed alongside the rebuild of Colossus Mk II,  the  world's  first  electronic computer.

The National Museum of Computing TNMOC is inviting members of the public and industry to sponsor the restoration of the Harwell computer by purchasing one of 25 shares at £4500 each. The funds will be used by TNMOC to undertake the restoration and  extend  the  ever-expanding museum. Insight Software has become the  first  sponsor  of  the Harwell/WITCH  computer restoration project.

The Harwell Computer dates back to 1949 when plans were drawn up for a machine to perform calculations then done  by  a  team  of  bright  young graduates using mechanical calculators. The team's work had been so tedious that mistakes were inevitable, so the aim  was  to  automate  the  work. Simplicity, reliability and unattended operation were the design priorities. Speed was a lower priority concern. The machine first ran in 1951. It was a relay-based  computer  using  900 Dekatron gas-filled tubes that could each hold a single digit in memorysimilar  to  RAM  in  a  modern computer-and paper tape for both input  and  program  storage.  The Dekatron was described in Elektor March 2008.

The  computer  was  operational  at Harwell  until  1957,  when  it  was offered in a competition for colleges to see who could make best use of it. Wolverhampton  and  Staffordshire Technical  College  (later  becoming Wolverhampton University) won and, then becoming known as the WITCH (Wolverhampton  Instrument  for Teaching Computing from Harwell), it was used in computer education until 1973. After a period on display at Birmingham Science Museum, it was disassembled and put in storage at Birmingham City Council Museums' Collection Centre. Their curatorial care and attention means it can still be made to work again.

Its arrival at TNMOC on 3 September will be the first stage in an expected year-long restoration challenge. The restoration project is under the aegis of the Computer Conservation Society, who have a long history of successful similar projects.

The  current  earliest  functioning computer is the 1956 Pegasus machine at The Science Museum in London. There  are  functioning  rebuilds  of earlier  machines,  including  the Colossus Mk 2 at TNMOC/ Bletchley Park.

## Wireless Carrier Gouging

Most people complain about their cell phone carriers. But for Mike Elgan, a journalist for Computerworld.com who  has  been  writing  about technology and consumer electronics

## October Calendar

MCCC   4418 Sharpsburg Drive    Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org for 20 years, the problem isn't just high prices and lengthy contracts.

In  his  recent  article  "Wireless Carriers: 10 Things I Hate About You," Elgan explained that this was an industry not only engaged in pricegouging, but whose anti-competitive practices have left the United States wireless industry lagging dramatically behind the rest of the globe.

Mike Elgan: Carriers seem to specialize in finding  ways  to  get  money  for  nothing. Recorded messages, the SMS charges, all that kind of stuff. Instead of innovating and competing with each other, and doing what the consumer electronics industry itself does, which is always better, faster, cheaper, better customer service and so on, carriers are just looking for ways to gouge you.

For example, Elgan points to the recent work of New York Times columnist  David  Pogue,  who uncovered  how  much  wireless carriers were making from longer calls by forcing consumers to listen to unnecessary  instructions  before leaving a voicemail.

Voicemail: At the tone, please record your message. When you are finished recording you can hang up, or press one for more options.

Mike  Elgan:  They  make  about  $620 million a year from that message. It's just a thing that they force on everybody so they can get more money.
