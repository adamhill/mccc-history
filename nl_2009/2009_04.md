## Amiga OS 4.1 for Pegasos II

Boys and girls, it's time to dust off your Pegasos II machine, or maybe to reduce the size of your MorphOS partition,  because  there's  a  new contender coming your way: ACube Systems  Srl  has  announced  the immediate availability of AmigaOS 4.1 for the Pegasos II. It's 01:40 here, so I can't check if the sky is falling, but I'm pretty sure it is.

If  only  a  few  months  ago  you would've told anyone in the Amiga community that AmigaOS 4.1 would be available for the Pegasos II, you would probably receive a pat on the head and a few reassuring words about going along with the nice man in the white coat. That was then, this is now: Pegasos II owners can enjoy AmigaOS 4.1.

When it comes to actually increasing the installed base of AmigaOS 4, the Pegasos II route isn't exactly going to make a whole lot of difference; the machine is no longer in production, so you need one from eBay or similar locations. With both MorphOS and AmigaOS contending for the same machine, prices for the Pegasos II will only go up.

Releasing AmigaOS 4.1 this way is more of a mental victory; despite all the  legal  bickering  and  other incomprehensible  legal  nonsense, AmigaOS is still making its way to new platforms, paving the way for the  release  everyone  is  actually waiting  for:  AmigaOS  4.1  for PowerPC Macs. Support for these old  Apple  boxes  is  what  both

MorphOS and AmigaOS 4.1 need in order to actually make any sizable impact. I know I personally would shell out cash for both of them if they ran on my PowerMac G4 dual450Mhz. To state it another way: apparently, Hyperion and ACube can market AmigaOS 4 for new machines now - then why on earth would you wait with at least a Mac Mini version? In  any  case,  AmigaOS  4.1  for Pegasos II is available immediately for 105 EUR.

## Amiga OS and the x86

Despite  the  recent  emergence  of several  new  ways  to  actually  run AmigaOS 4.0, the supply of machines is still extremely small, and not very future proof. As such, one of the most recurring questions within the Amiga community is why don't they port the darn thing to x86? In the past  few  days  and  weeks, Amigaworld.net has been overladen with threads and comments about the x86 question, and it has even driven someone to set up a crude bounty for an x86 version for AmigaOS 4.0. The current x86 thread was started March 19, and already measures 692 posts in 35 pages.

There are several standard replies to the x86 question within the Amiga community. There are people who still  see  a  future  in  the  PowerPC market, even after years and years of utter misery. Sadly, even though the PowerPC platform is far from dead, it simply doesn't play a role any more in the desktop market. Whenever a company announces an AmigaOS4capable  board,  we're  getting hardware that's 9 years old with an insane price tag.

A number of Amigans even go as far as to say that people shouldn't be able to get AmigaOS4 so easily, and they complain that people who want an x86 variant of the AmigaOS are just looking for a free ride. The word 'elitist'  doesn't  even  begin  to describe this attitude.

There also also people who claim that  moving  AmigaOS4  to  x86 would mean the end of the Amiga operating system, because it would not be able to compete with other x86 operating systems such as Linux and Windows. This seems like a rather  odd  reasoning  to  me:  we cannot compete if we run on x86, but we can compete if we run on underpowered, overpriced hardware, with no option for people to try it out  before  buying?  Logic  is something that has left much of the Amiga community long ago.

Another, much more valid reply is that there already is an x86 Amiga operating system: AROS. AROS is open source, free, and runs on lots of  hardware,  and  can  even  have other operating systems as hosts. However,  it  is  'only'  sourcecompatible  with  AmigaOS,  not binary compatible. This, however, is a moot point in this discussion since a possible x86 version of AmigaOS4 wouldn't  be  able  to  run  legacy software either.

Sadly, the discussion itself seems to be  moot  since  Hyperion,  who develop AmigaOS4 might not be allowed to port AmigaOS4 over in the  first  place.  The  company  is entangled in a legal battle with Amiga, Inc., a battle no one really understands any more. Still, these legal troubles have not prevented Hyperion from releasing AmigaOS4 for the Pegasos II, which raises the question just how much of a limiting factor the lawsuit actually is.

It's a sad state of affairs, but there's little anyone can do. It's really too bad, because  AmigaOS4  certainly  has something  to  offer  to  many enthusiasts. As it stands now, however, getting AmigaOS4 is simply too much of an investment in a relatively old and limited platform, and especially in the economic climate we're in today, few people  will  shell  out  boatloads  of money for a toy operating system. …by Thom Holwerda http://snurl.com/eplgj

## Lafayette, LA Gets Fiber

February 6, 2009

After nearly five years of planning and fighting with local cable and phone companies,  the  Lafayette  Utilities System  opened  its  fiber-optic broadband network for business. The utility began offering service this week, according to the Lafayette, La. local newspaper, The  Daily  Advertiser .  A small number of customers already have phone, TV, and Internet service. And beginning Friday, LUS will begin marketing the service to customers in the first phase of the roll out. LUS

plans to roll out service gradually in three phases and expects to offer a triple  play  service  to  all  residents throughout the city by 2011.

The utility system, which built a fiber network to service its utilities business, had  been  offering  wholesale bandwidth services to Internet service providers,  and  providing  retail broadband services to city agencies since 2002. In 2004, the agency began looking at ways to offer broadband services to residents and businesses.

BellSouth and Cox Communications, the  local  telephone  and  cable companies serving Lafayette, strongly opposed the utility system's plan. And they filed several lawsuits to stop the utility from raising the funds to build the  network.  But  after  the  public voted in favor of the project and the utility fought a series of lengthy legal battles that went all the way to the Louisiana Supreme Court, LUS was finally able to sell bonds to fund its project.

The new network was supposed to launch in January, but it was delayed by  negotiations  over  television programming, The Daily Advertiser said.  It's  easy  to  see  why  Cox Communications,  the  local  cable operator, and AT&amp;T, which bought local phone company BellSouth, are threatened by LUS. Pricing for the new  triple  play  services  are  very competitive. Consumers can get a triple play bundle from about $85 to $200 a month. And the broadband services offer download and upload

## April Calendar

April 6 - Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter 7:00 pm - South Grand Prairie Library 760 Bardin Road, Grand Prairie

April 6 - MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approx 9:15 pm - Location TBD

April 25 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am

MCCC   4418 Sharpsburg Drive    Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org speeds between 10Mbps to 50Mbps. The standalone broadband service costs  about  $29  for  symmetrical 10Mbps downloads and uploads; $45 for 30Mbps, and $58 for 50Mbps service. The service doesn't require a contract and there's no installation fee.

The  maximum  download  speed offered by AT&amp;T is 6Mbps for $43 a month. And its cheapest is a 768Kbps service for $20 a month. Cox only offers Internet download speeds up to  15Mbps.  Depending  on  what specific services are selected, bundled pricing  from  AT&amp;T  and  Cox  is comparable. The big exception is that AT&amp;T and Cox offer these prices as part of a promotion, whereas LUS prices are the actual standard prices and will not expire.

Lafayette is just one of many cities that  has  tried  to  build  its  own broadband network. In nearly every instance, cable and phone companies have tried to prevent these network build outs. They argue that it's unfair for public utilities and cities to use taxpayer money or government bonds to build competing networks. It will be interesting to see how this debate shakes out under the new Obama administration. President Obama has made it clear that he hopes to fund projects to bring broadband service to every American. There is a chance that some of these public utilities and other non-traditional entities may end up  with  some  of  the  billions  of dollars in promised federal funding to build these networks.
