## The Virtual World of Java

## An Amiga Software Bonanza? by Rick Bilonick, Pittsburgh Computer User Group

I magine going down to your local Egghead's and buying software  for  your  Amiga.  Impossible?  Certainly  you can't  do  it  today.  But,  incredible  as  it  seems,  it  may actually happen in the near future. How is this possible, given  the  state  of  the  Amiga  hardware  and  software markets since the demise of Commodore several years ago?

If  it  does  happen it is unlikely to be due to a resurgence in the Amiga (although we would all like to see this). It could happen if a language named Java™ catches on. What is Java™ and why is it so important? First, the name. Java™ is  not  an  acronym  for  anything.  Java™  is,  like  C++,  an object-oriented  programming  language.  If  this  is  all  that Java™ is, it would be unlikely to distinguish itself among programming  languages  -  and  even  less  likely  to  help increase available software for the Amiga.

Where Java™ stands apart from all other languages is its  ability  to  run  on  ANY  computer  -  regardless  of  the computer's CPU (central processing unit - in the Amiga, some  variant  of  a  Motorola  680xx  processor)  and  the computer's operating system (on the Amiga, this would be AmigaOS). Now, of course, there is a catch (there had to be a  catch).  The  catch  is,  for  Java™  to  run  on  a  particular computer  with  a  particular  operating  system  (CPU/OS, there must be a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When someone  writes  a  Java™  application  (e.g.,  a  word  processing program),  the  code  is  exactly  the  same  regardless  of CPU/OS. The JVM translates the Java Code - on the fly - into  instructions  the  particular  computer  can  actually execute. The JVM is simply a piece of software, written for a particular CPU/OS, that does the translation.

As  far  as  I  can  see,  Java™  should  be  irresistible  to software developers. Instead of writing an application for a particular computer, porting it to other computers (which involves likely adapting/modifying and then compiling it for each supported CPU/OS), and then having to maintain several versions, a developer would write one set of code and maintain one set of code. Strictly speaking, a developer never has to compile the code - each user compiles the code  each  time  the  application  is  executed  for  his/her CPU/OS.

Now,  of  course,  people  have  been  able  to  run  a program written for one CPU/OS on a different CPU/OS. This has typically been done through emulation. A software program is written that emulates a different CPU/OS which allows the application software to run. A number of emulators have been available for the Amiga. For example, the shareware program ShapeShifter allows Mac software to be run on the Amiga using only a software emulator. There also are pure software emulators for DOS. There are several problems with this approach. First, someone has to write the emulation code (not an easy task). Second, the emulation software is often propietary which means you have to buy  it  first.  And  third,  because  of  the  complexity,  the application software tends to run more slowly because of the overhead of using one system to emulate another. An example of the slowness is given by the emulation of a C64 on  an  Amiga.  The  A64  package  allows  you  to  run  C64 programs  on  the  Amiga  without  the  need  of  any  C64 hardware (after you first have copied the applications from the old C64 floppies to an Amiga floppy or hard drive). In order  to  get  reasonably  good  performance,  you  need  a fairly fast Amiga - at least an A3000 or accelerated A2000 or  A500.  Even  so,  the  A64  package  was  an  excellent emulation (although it could not handle every conceivable C64 program) and it ran extremely well on the A4000 and A1200. But, in the end, you are emulating a much slower computer by using a much more powerful computer.

Java™  improves  on  this  scenario.  The  Java  Virtual Machine doesn't emulate any particular computer. It's not an  emulation.  The  JVM  translates  the  Java  code  into executable instructions for the computer as the application is running. Thus, Java™ applications, strictly speaking, are not compiled - they are interpreted. (This is similar to the original  concept  of  the  BASIC  language.  The  original

Dallas

## The AGM Journal The AGM Journal

BASIC language was interpreted and not compiled. This was done to make writing and debugging faster and easier.)

Of course,  running  interpreted  code  is  slower  than running compiled code - often slower by a factor of 20. For many applications, especially when running on much more  powerful  computers  made  currently,  this  is  not  a problem. In addition, the technique of doing 'just in time' (JIT)  compilation  can  dramatically  speed  up  the  Java™ application. When the JIT option is invoked, the first time a  Java™  code  module  (called  a  'class')  is  invoked,  it  is compiled. Thereafter, each time it is called, the compiled code is used. You can also permanently compile all the code first and have Java store the code in each class.

Java™  was  developed  as  part  of  a  project  at  Sun Microsystems to provide a language for controlling computer products which use computer chips. As it was being developed, its application to distributed processing (such as exists in a network and the Internet) was noticed. The first major  use  of  Java™  has  been  the  Java™  applets  (small applications) used on the Internet. These applets eliminate the need for applications residing on the computer accessing the Internet. Instead, the Java™ applets are downloaded when needed, executed, and (eventually) deleted. The applet is the same regardless of the CPU/OS so they run the same on everyone's computer.

Sun  Microsystems  has  made  Java™  available  for licencing and porting free of charge. This helps insure that the JVM will exist on most if not all computer platforms. Sun has also instituted a certification program to insure that Java™  will  not  be  modified  or  extended  which  would prevent the same code from running exactly the same on all platforms. Certified applications will be 100% Java™.

Is there a JVM for the Amiga? Well, not yet. But there is  a  group  of  programmers  working  on  this.  Mattias Johansson  (matj@o.lst.se)  is  the  sponsor  for  the  P'Jami (Porting Java™ Programming Language to the Amiga). For more i n f o r m a t i o n on t h i s project, s e e http://www.mjavasoft.com/products/JDL/jdk-porst.html on  the  Internet.  For  general  information  on  Java™,  see http://www.javasoft.com.

When this port of the JVM is available on the Amiga, Amiga users  will  be  able  to  run  Java™  applets  from  the Internet.  Also,  shortly,  complete  applications  will  be available.  Would  you  like  to  run  a  modern  version  of WordPerfect  (a  word  processor),  Quattro  Pro  (a  spreadsheet),  a  charting  program,  a  graphing  program,  and  a presentation  program?  Corel  (the  current  owner  of WordPerfect) is porting this suite of business applications to Java™.  A  pre-beta  release  of  Corel  Office  for  Java™  is available from Corel's web pages (http://www.,corel.com). So far, after downloading the 2.5mb of code and unzipping it,  I've  been able to run the same code on three different platforms: Silicon Graphics' IRIX 6.3 (Unix), OS/2 on an IBM clone, and NT on the same model IBM clone. The Java™ code uses an abstract windowing system so that the graphical user interface looks like the GUI of the system it's running on. The finished Corel Office for Java™ should go on sale the first half of this year. The pre-beta demo runs very nicely, but, of course, not all features are implemented (you can read and write files but not print, for example). It clearly works and works well - it proves the basic concept of Java™. Sun has also released an Internet browser written completely in Java™ which is available for downloading.

So we might actually see a time when the software applications  we  use  are  independent  of  the  particular computer and operating  system  we  use.  This  could  help free  us  from  the  stranglehold  that  Microsoft  has  on  software. It might also allow for much greater innovation in the design of computers. Without an established software base,  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  create  a  totally  new computer. If Java™ succeeds, and especially if it becomes the first choice for developers, a newly created computer would only need to have the JVM ported to it (a relatively simple thing for a computer company).

## MERAPI

## A Java Virtual Machine For The Amiga From Haage &amp; Partner A Press Release

T he  MERAPI  project  is  still  under  development. Project  started  in  late  1996.  Release  date  is  about July/August  97.  We  will  release  information  on features  and  prices  in  June/July.  'MERAPI'  will  be  the optimal solution for programmers and end-users.

We proudly announce another important project for the future of the Amiga:

Code name: 'MERAPI'

Taking You To Java

Java's gathering momentum in the computer market has raised hopes of a more open, decentralized, and tolerant software future than the developments of recent years have led  us  to  expect.  For  Amiga  users,  it  has  given  rise  to  a

Java's gathering momentum in the computer market has raised hopes of a more open, decentralized, and tolerant software future than the developments of recent years have led us to expect.

demand for participation in this future-participation that can  only  be  provided  by  a  good  Java  Virtual  Machine implementation  (the  software  engine  that  executes  programs created in Java) for our machine.

To meet this demand, Haage &amp; Partner are developing a  Java  Virtual  Machine  (JVM)  implementation  under  the code name 'Merapi.' In our perception, the Java technology  has  several  attractive  features  particularly  from  the Amiga users' point of view:

- It will bring in new applications. Dozens upon dozens of companies in the PC software market have already committed themselves to delivering applications that can run on any machine that supports Java, breaking at  last  the  old  chains  of  platform  incompatibility. Their new products will now add value to the Amiga as well as to the more common platforms.
- As software availability ceases to be a compelling factor in deciding  on  a  computer  platform,  the  Amiga's friendliness  and  ease  of  use  will  prove  sufficient reason to choose it over eg. Windows or the Mac OS if one happens to prefer the Amiga computer.
- The similarity of design principles and flexibility of Java

![Image](1997_08_artifacts/image_000002_2c0c036f089e02e744367fee00f8f312d130e065231e2fa8be1161b81c3eabfc.png)

and the Amiga OS have great synergetic potential: A good JVM implementation can make it seem as if Java and  the  Amiga  operating  system  were  designed  for each other from the start.

-  Java  complements  the  Amiga  system  well.  Memory protection  and  resource  tracking,  for  instance,  are integral parts of the Java environment. Whereas these are  merely a duplication of effort when used under operating  systems  that  already  have  such  features built  in,  on  the  Amiga  they  very  neatly  fill  in  the blanks  that  many  users  see  in  the  Amiga  operating system.  The  Merapi  project  focuses  specifically  on bringing these benefits to the Amiga user base.

Apart  from  the  obvious  goals  of  compatibility  and the  ability  to  run  Java  software  fast,  which  all  JVM  implementations  strive  for,  Merapi  has  more  characteristic aims. The main ones are:

- High quality that developers and users alike can depend on for robustness, security, and longevity.
- Making the best possible use of what the Amiga OS has to offer. Rather than attempting to cram UNIX code into  an  Amiga  mold  or  imitating  existing  PC products, Merapi is designed for the Amiga from the ground up to give you the best possible match.
- Letting non-Java software, as well as the user, make the best  possible  use  of  what  Java  has  to  offer.  The services of the Java subsystem are made available to external  software  through an open interface, so the use of Java software is not limited to eye candy inside a Web browser window. Java will be no second-class citizen in your system!

MERAPI project is done by Jeroen Vermeulen in cooperation with the Storm team. MERAPI will be integrated into Web browsers like Voyager NG, but it will also be a stand-alone JAVA interpreter with just-in-time compiler (to speed it up, JIT) to run Java applications like Corel Office for Java.

MERAPI  will  also  be  integrated  into  the  Storm Development System to enable programmers to write JAVA applications on the Amiga. A port to p.OS and PowerUP will be done.

9 th  July  1997  -  Since  1995  ICS  have  been  at  the forefront in developing expansion systems that enable A1200 and A4000 users to make the best use of Hard Drive  and  CD  Rom  technology.  Their  MMS  tm Technology has made it possible for the Amiga to utilise up to four EIDE devices.

In  a  not  surprising  announcement  ICS  have  been awarded a license to produce A1200 based tower systems. Micronik  and  Index  Information  Ltd  have  already  been granted licenses and it was only a matter of time that the leaders  in  multimedia  technology  for  the  Amiga  would follow suit. The new A1200 tower system will be called the Amigo PC range.

'We  know  that  the  Amiga  is  the  best  machine available for the home and professional user. Its operating system  is  far  superior  to  that  of  Wintel  and  Mac  based machines and that's the reason why we don't develop for any other platform. Amiga OS is far more efficient in the areas of memory, resources and hard disk storage than any other operating system. The future of the Amiga has now become very exciting and we were very pleased when we heard the announcement that Micronik, Index Information Ltd  and  then  ourselves  had  been  awarded  licenses  to produce Amiga based systems' - Barry Turner of Intrinsic

O berursel, May 12, 1997: phase 5 digital products today announced the expansion of the PowerUp product family for Amiga computers. Beside the two  products  that  had  been  announced  earlier,  the Cyberstorm PPC and the Blizzard 603e Power Board, there will be an additional model for the A12000, the Blizzard 603e+ Power Board, which combines the PowerPC RISC processor with an 68040 or 68060 CPU, as well as a model for the Amiga 1500/2000, the Blizzard 2604 Power Board. Additionally, it has been decided that all PowerUp board will come with SCSI on board instead of beeing an option, which adds additional value to these products.

With  this  expanded  product  line,  phase  5  digital products offers a complete line of PowerUp accelerators for the  Amiga  1200,  1500/2000,  3000  and  4000  models,  and provides  a  smooth  upgrade  path  for  owners  of  68030-, 68040-  or  68060-based  accelerators.  Additionally,  phase  5 will  release  a  fast  graphics  card  as  an  add-on  to  those PowerUp  models  that  go  into  the  desktop  and  tower models, namely the Cyberstorm PPC and the Blizzard 2604

Power Board. The 1997 PowerUp accelerator product line includes the follwoing models:

CyberVisionPPC - A high-end graphic card for use with  the  Cyberstorm  PPC  and  the  Blizzard  2604  Power Board

The CyberVisionPPC is a high-performance graphic card  which can be installed on the expnasion slot of the PowerPC604e-based PowerUp Accelerators, the Cyberstorm PPC and the Blizzard 2604 Power Board. It is scheduled for delivery in August, and will become available simultaneously  with  the  Blizzard  2604  Power  Board. Especially for the Blizzard 2604 the use of the

The CyberVisionPPC is equipped with the powerful PERMEDIA graphics controller, which provides an outstanding 3D performance of up to 42 million textured 3D pixels per second

CyberVisionPPC is highly recommended as the slow access to the ECS chip memory or Zorro-II-based graphics boards in the A1500/A2000 may limit the system performance in applications  with  lots  of  graphic  output;  but  also  the performance  of  the  Cyberstorm  PPC  will  benefit  significantly from the data transfer rates of up to 100 MB/s (from the processor into the video memory) in demanding applications such as fast 3D visualization and similar tasks.

Not only the ultra-fast access of the processor into the video  memory,  but  also  the  internal  performance  of  the CyberVisionPPC will provide a breathtaking performance. The  CyberVisionPPC  is  equipped  with  the  powerful PERMEDIA  graphics  controller,  which  provides  an outstanding 3D performance of up to 42 million textured 3D pixels per second, with hardware-accelerated rendering functions  such  as  z-buffering,  gouraud-shading,  fogging, blending and anti-aliasing. As the design of the PERMEDIA hardware suits perfectly for OpenGL implementations, it's 3D performance can support the CyberGL functionality of CyberGraphX  V3  Native  which  comes  along  with  the PowerUp boards. In combination with the high floatingpoint  performance  of  the  PowerPC604e  processor  a breathtaking performance in professional 3D applications can be achieved by this implementation. Additionally, the PERMEDIA processor supports functions like color space conversion, chroma keying and XY-scaling which will be used  by  the  software  MPEG  decoding  routines  of

CyberGraphX V3 Native.

The CyberVisionPPC used 64-bit wide SGRAM with a data transfer rate of up to 660 MB/s; this in combination with the fast RAM-DAC allows display resolutions of up to 1280x1024 pixel in true color mode and with a high refresh rate of at least 70 Hz. The boards comes along with 4 MB of display memory as standard. The recommended price for the  CyberVisionPPC  will  be  at  UK  Pound  219.00;  customers  of  a  PowerUp  upgrade  can  buy  this  board  for  a special rate of UK Pound 189.00. In the USA the recommended  price  for  the  CyberVisionPPC  will  be  at  US$ 299.00;  customers  of  a  PowerUp  upgrade  can  buy  this board for a special rate of US$ 239.00.

T oronto, May  5,  1997:  PXL  computers  and clickBOOM are proud to announce a cooperation with Phase 5 Digital Products on making games for Power Amiga.

'We strongly believe that the future for the Amiga computer  lies  in  PowerPC  processor.  Furthermore,  we believe  Phase  5  is  and  will  continue  to  be  the  Amiga hardware leader. Therefore, we have selected Power Amiga as our future platform of choice', says Alexander Petrovic, PXL and clickBOOM producer.

Appropriately  enough,  the  first  ever  Power  Amiga game will be Myst from clickBOOM. It is a perfect opportunity for Myst and PowerUp accelerators to appear at the same time. Following Myst, other forthcoming clickBOOM 'killer games' will be fully optimized for the PowerPC chip, as well.

Phase  5  Digital  Products  highly  appreciates  the development of Myst for the PowerUp accelerators and the plans  of  clickBOOM  to  add  PowerUp  support  to  more titles  in  the  future.  'We  are  happy  to  see  how  engaged clickBOOM has realized all their ambitious projects in the past,  and  we  are  excited  that  their  new  projects  will  be targeted for the PowerUp accelerators' says Wolf Dietrich of  phase  5.  'Beside  all  the  demanding  creativity  software that we expect to come for the PowerUp boards, it's good to see powerful games with the real thrill coming also soon. What would such a powerhorse Amiga be without some breathtaking amusement? Still fast, but less fun... It's really impressive and good to see that clickBOOM is in the front line  of  visionary  development  for  a  new  performance dimension.'

Support for Power Amigas will have several distinct advantages:

1.  It  will  give  users  a  valid  reason  to  upgrade  as  soon  as PowerPC boards become available.
2. New clickBOOM games written for Power Amiga will be  breathtaking  and  a  serious  competition  to  the games on other platforms. This in return, will make the rest of the industry look very positively on the Amiga market.

3. Impressive CPU power will allow clickBOOM a technical  freedom  to  convert  any  big  game  from  other platforms to the Power Amiga.

The  exact  timeline  of  clickBOOM  Power  Amiga releases  is  still  to  be  decided.  Currently,  clickBOOM's strategy can be outlined in two steps:

1. Starting with Myst, a couple of forthcoming projects will support both 680x0 and PowerPC chip.
2. ClickBOOM will use this transitional period to work on a  first  Power  Amiga-only  'killer'  game.  After  its release, all the following games will be Power Amigaonly.

For more information about our future strategy visit clickBOOM web site at www.clickboom.com

We  hope  you  like  our  plan  and  share  our  vision. Naturally, for the Power Amiga to ultimately succeed we need your support and input. As always, please feel free to contact us at info@clickboom.com

Best regards, PXL computers and clickBOOM

## BBS News

The Best of The BBS Uploads Selected by Bill Raecke

T his will be the first month for this new format. This column used to be called 'Library News,' but with the current widespread BBS and Internet usage, it no longer seems necessary to build library disks each month. Few people wanted them anyway. But it seems to me that there still might be those of you who are interested in my (humble!) opinion of what the best new additions to the our BBS collection are each month. That way you might not have to keep up with everything just to stay current on the best that's out there. This format has another advantage as  well…it  will  allow  me  to  feature  things  that  were  too large  to  fit  on  a  floppy  and,  thus,  never  made  it  to  the library. So here goes…

Miami is arguably the best way to access the Internet with an Amiga. It's certainly the easiest and cheapest. For the record, Miami is a TCP/IP stack. If that doesn't make sense,  it's  the  program  that  actually  connects  to  the Internet via your modem and phone line. Once connected, other programs (for browsing the web, reading and writing e-mail, and reading news groups) can use that connection to let you do what you like. This month Miami was upgraded to 2.1c. There are upgrades for the registered versions and a demo version  as  well.  The  demo  is  fully  functional  but limits your on-line time to just one hour at a time. After an hour you get disconnected and have to re-connect - but, hey, you ought to be registered anyway.

Like to collect pictures? This is a good month to fill

up that hard drive. There are some outstanding pictures of some horses, tigers, jaguars, and a baby harp seal. And there are about twenty outstanding pictures of wolves. These are really beautiful pictures. You ought to check them out.

If  you still use the Amiga's standard serial port and the standard serial.device to make your connections to the BBS and to the Internet, it's time you changed. 8n1.device offers  a  much  better  alternative.  It's  better  because  it's faster and will use less of your computer's resources while transferring data. That's important because it allows more and better multi-tasking - and also because you won't get as many transmission errors at high connect speeds ('cause you computer is better able to keep up with things with this  more  efficiently  written  device  driver).  If  you're already  using  the  8n1.device,  you  still  should  make  sure you have the latest version.

MCP has been upgraded this month to version 1.30 beta 20. Yes, it's a beta version…but I've been running it without  problems,  so  I  have  no  hesitation  about  recommending it. MCP stands for 'Master Control Program.' It's the  'ultimate'  commodity.  It  provides  just  about  every system enhancement you can think of from mouse blanking  to  gadget  enhancement.  I  can't  imagine  my  Amiga without this program.

Of course, there are the standard, monthly updates to the  akPNG,  akLJPG,  akJFIF,  akSVG,  and  akPNG datatypes. These datatype are written to be used with the

CyberGraphX retargetable graphics system. They are amazingly fast. If you are using the CyberGraphX software you need t o be using t h e s e datatypes.

TolleUhr  is  the  nicestlooking  analog  clock  you'll find.  I  keep  it  running  on  my Workbench all the time. New in this  version  is  support  for  the upgraded  picture  datatype  for CyberGraphX  software.  This makes  it  possible  to  run  the clock on a 16 or 24-bit Workbench and use any brush to serve as a fill pattern. There's even  an  option  to  make  the clock 'transparent' so that you can  see  the  background  right through  it,  with  or  without  a frame around the  window. Makes a really nice effect! AGM

## Meeting Notes

![Image](1997_08_artifacts/image_000007_165203306dd03ed67b98368e1657ee9b0704d035dc4e91dd83663bf45c4eef85.png)

## Amiga by the Loop Meetings for June and July Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

June gives us heat and waiting on what the heck is going on with the Amiga. Gateway has yet to make a real statement on what they intend to do. Like heat, waiting can really get you down in a situation like this. We also have two other companies moving in their own direction. Pios has Dave Haynie, innovator of many Amiga parts, working on a PowerPC powered Amiga replacement, featuring offthe-shelf parts for a very low price with great performance. Then there is phase5 with their PowerUp cards, featuring PowerPC  for  existing  Amigas,  and  the  A\Box,  their interpretation of the Amiga for the future. That is three different paths hoping to lead to the same goal. All of them can succeed if they can be compatible with each other.

For our meeting in June we were a bit shocked to see we were not scheduled for the meeting. A small event like ours can fall through the cracks at a big company like the one  hosting  us.  It  is  free  so  how  can  we  complain!  We started off the meeting by announcing a new way to handle the  library.  No  more  disk  of  the  month!  With  declining membership, modems  being more common, and the Internet,  the  library  has  fewer needs put upon it. I remember when it took the whole meeting for the librarian to copy all the disks that were needed. Now he rarely  needs  to  turn  on  his computer. Due to a rather noisy meeting  in  the  next  room,  we decided  to  move  to  another room  and  discovered  much  of the  stuff  we  used  at  our  previous location! We then discussed METCOM. Our annual  event looks to be facing a tough year. Money  can  kill  all  sorts  of things, and METCOM is facing just  that  sort  of  shortage.  Cost of  setup,  cost  of  location,  and cost  overall  are  a  few  of  the factors  facing  METCOM. One thing is sure - we intend to do

something! We next moved to the latest news on PowerPC, which,  as  I  mentioned,  appears  to  be  converging  on  the Amiga. Our question session brought us a few things to discuss,  such  as  replacement  power  supplies.  If  you  need one take a look at the Big Foot. Internet service providers came  up  next.  The  Star  Telegram  has  proved  to  be  a favorite  with  its  free  service  if  you  subscribe.  They  now even  offer  a  post  card  service.  We  finally  moved  to  our main presentation,  BIG  MONITORS! Opps, that's what we planned,  instead  we  had  a  presentation  on  computer maintenance.  Ink  cartridge  refilling  for  printers,  mouse maintenance,  edge  connector  cleaning,  and  keyboard cleaning. This might not sound exciting, but it worked for me. I cleaned my keyboard for the first time ever. Thanks, it looks great!

July gives us more heat and more waiting on what the heck is going on with the Amiga. At least by the time you read  this,  we  will  know  that  three  companies  have  been licensed to make Amiga clones. While I find this good news and a bit exciting, what I found interesting was that these companies are allowed to say 'powered by Amiga' but not that  they  are  Amiga  computers.  They  are  also  offering features not available on real Amiga computers, such as PCI slots.  Amiga  International  has  released  a  few  software upgrades, and they have hired a few new people, but no news from them yet. You know it gets very hot in August.

The July meeting gave us a more advanced version of the  previous  month.  This  time  the  door  was  locked! Fortunately, we still got in. Our meeting started off with the  announcement  that  METCOM  will  take  place  on October 25, 1997! This got everyone talking about what would or will happen. Look for a full announcement in our

The AGM Journal

![Image](1997_08_artifacts/image_000008_4a18227126d370638c08a143db9a7d08210e6dff9f4903c1928f1f77cd4e4ed8.png)

newsletter! We then moved to talk on what was happening with  the  Amiga.  Whether  it  is  the  new  clones,  the  new PowerPC accelerators, or the new designs, all were providing Amiga users something to think about. The big question for the night. Where to now? What should I do, with all of these choices being presented to us? All of this seemed an  appropriate  lead-in  for  our  main  presentation  -  a demonstration of what is available to Amiga users today. We had three A-3000's with 68060, 68040, and 68030. The 68060 had a Cybervision 64, the 68040 had a Picasso II+, and the 68030 used the ECS chipset. We had an A-4000 with 68040 and AGA, and a 68030-powered A-1200 with AGA. A comparison test showed the obvious. Accelerators and graphics cards give you the fastest Amiga. The differences were truly amazing in graphics. One surprise was the 1200 beating the 4000 in several graphics tests. This is due to a design flaw in the 4000. It was intended to be one machine and a last minute change made it the machine we know. There  are  actually  some  pieces  in  the  4000  that  are  not used.  When  it  came  time  for  the  1200,  these  bugs  were fixed.  This  explains  the  1200  motherboard  as  being  the starting point for all of these clones coming out. Finally, we got to see what might be the final upgrade for any Amiga. A 16 bit sound card! One of the disappointing things about the  AGA  chipset  when  it  came  out  was  the  lack  of  an update of Paula. Rumors of a new super Paula hung around 'till  the  very  end  of  Commodore.  Though  a  few  sound cards have come and gone over the years, none have really been a replacement for Paula. That has changed with the introduction of several sound cards during the year. The Delfina was the card shown at the meeting, giving a taste of what 16 bit sound is about. If the machines of the future beat what was shown tonight by such a large margin as they say, 350MIPS for the PowerPC vs 82MIPS for the 68060, then the future of the Amiga looks fast for everyone. Now if they would just speed up the news on what is going on!

## Amiga North Dallas Meeting Michael Turner

Our July meeting started just a little late as there was quite a bit of pre-meeting banter going on. Various topics of discussion included finalization of Gateway's acquisition of Amiga  International,  differences  between  various  accelarator boards and why there are so many advertisers in the  Amiga  magazines  wanting  to  buy  old  A2000s.  One member also mentioned that he had not received the latest issue of Amiga Computing and wanted to know if anyone else  had  received  theirs.  Also,  someone  finally  explained where and what a video port is to me!

Eddie Corr also mentioned that SoftLogik is shipping their latest upgrade to PageStream. Upgrades to ImageFX and Aladin 3-D are also available. It is nice to see that there are  still  a  number  of  software  companies  supporting  the

Amiga!  One  member  also  mentioned  he  had  some  old harddrives for sale and naturally this led to a side discussion on various harddrives.

Ned Kelly announced that there are indeed tentative plans for another METCOM this year. The date tentatively scheduled  is  for  Saturday,  October  25th.  However,  the location has changed to the Brookside Center in Hurst. Of course,the flea market will be held as usual however, as the Brookside  Center  is  just  one  open  room  there  probably will not be any classes held this time, although with enough interest  shown this could possibly change. On a positive note, parking will be free.

Gus finally broke through all this to call the meeting to  order.  After  a  few  minor  preliminaries  of  hooking  up our computer to the projection TV screen, we once again began 'surfing the net' in order 'to see what we could see.' What  we  saw  were  pictures  of  Sojourner  rover  on  the surface of Mars. Yes, we were at the NASA website. Not only were there pictures of the surface of Mars, but there were pictures and descriptions of the rover itself. How the rover moved, how big it was, and what powered it were all covered  at  this  site.  Interesting  facts  such  as  how  much power it consumed per day and the shelf life of its batteries were  all  explained  in  clear  and  metaphorically  based comparisons. Somehow, we reached a link to a Star Trek website and from there it was a short hop to the Babylon V homepage where there were posted summaries of all the past, present and (soon to be) future shows.

After that, we visited a few sites dedicated to some TV celebrities (that I had no idea who they were) and then one member gave an address for a homepage that he had designed. Naturally, this brought out a discussion on what software one might use to do such a thing and how one might go about doing it.

In  between,  we  also  visited  the  Software  Hut homepage  and  a  couple  of  other  interesting  sites  that nobody was exactly  sure  what  they  were,  even  after  we read the pages and looked at the pictures! Perhaps 'art for the sake of art' is not all it's cracked up to be!

By this time it was time to pack it all up and call it a night. Gus mentioned that if anyone has a good idea for a presentation,  please  let  us  know.  It's  all  good  to  use  the Amiga to peek into the lives of celebrities, read deranged homepages  designed  by  slightly  paranoid-schizophrenic minds, and to visit the surface of Mars, but every once in a while it's nice to see something normal done with this great computer on planet earth. So, if you're doing something unusual or abnormal with your Amiga (or even something usual and normal), bring it to our next meeting. We'd love to see it!

We'll meet next month same place, same time, on the third Tuesday of the month. Remember, if you arrive just a little  late  there  will  be  a  walkie-talkie  by  the  front  door. Just turn it on and speak into it and someone will be down in a minute to let you in. See Ya' There!
