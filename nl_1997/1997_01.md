## A Publication of the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club January 1997

## The following received from one of our club members: Ownership Update

## An open letter from QuickPac

The past few years have not been kind to the Amiga Community.  Since  the  demise  of  Commodore,  the ownership and future of the Amiga has been continually uncertain. The only thing that has remained constant is the  loyalty  of  Amiga  users.  It  is  with  respect  to  this loyalty that we feel it necessary to let YOU know the current state of affairs and what QuikPak is doing to see that the Amiga has the successful future it so deserves.

Back when Amiga Technologies was owned by Escom, QuikPak  was  selected  to  manufacture  the  complete A4000T  and  components  for  the  A1200.  During  the collapse of Escom and the subsequent negotiations with VIScorp, QuikPak continued manufacturing and servicing  Amiga  Computers.  Throughout  this  time  of uncertainty, QuikPak continued to support the platform, placing ads in the North American publication Amazing Computing ,  forging  alliances  with  Amiga  developers and  supporters,  and  developing  new  products  of  our own. Recently, at AmigaFest in Toronto, we unveiled two  new  computers  and  we  have  been  shipping  the `060  Accelerator  for  the  A4000T.  We  believe  this product development clearly demonstrates our commitment to the Amiga.

It  now  appears  evident  that  negotiations  between VIScorp  and  Amiga  Technologies  have  reached  a standstill. As a creditor of Amiga Technologies, QuikPak has a vested interest in seeing the future of the Amiga handled properly. To this end, QuikPak has placed an offer  in  front  of  the  German  liquidator  for  Amiga Technologies, and we are awaiting further information regarding this.

What does this mean to you, the end user? QuikPak believes that there is more to the Amiga than a simple set  top  box.  We  believe  that  the  A4000  and  its successors have a place in the market. We believe that a model along the lines of the A1200 also can play an important role in the future of the Amiga. We further believe  that  products  currently  under  development  at QuikPak can bring the Amiga back to the forefront in innovation.  We  believe  that  working  closely  with developers,  other  manufacturers,  distributors,  and dealers is necessary to make the Amiga a success. And, perhaps most importantly of all, we believe in listening to you, the person who has kept this platform alive.

We hope that the new year will allow us to bring you good  news,  that  QuikPak  will  be  successful  in  our negotiations with the German liquidator. We trust that the liquidator will move quickly, and justly, to see these events through. We encourage any and all input from the Amiga Community - let us know what you want to see.  And,  finally,  we  encourage  those  responsible  for handling the Amiga Technologies' assets to be as open as we at QuikPak are striving to be.

Sincerely, Dave Ziembicki C.E.O QuikPak Corporation
