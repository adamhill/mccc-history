## Flea Market Extravaganza

## It's Coming Soon By Mark Stodola

W hat, you may ask, is The MCCC Flea Market Extravaganza and what has happened to METCOM? Well, it was decided by the MCCC Board of Directors that, because of our declining membership,  our  club  could  not  put  on  a  proper  METCOM. Something had to be done to take its place so the MCCC Flea Market Extravaganza was born. The Extravaganza will basically be our usual flea market, along with local dealers (Commodore Country has already committed to show) and a few other goodies.

meetings. Items will also be collected during the October chapter meetings. If you can not attend the meetings the collectors listed below have forms and will take your items. Please call one of us by October 18 to make arrangements for your items.

The Brookside Convention Center

THE FACTS Date: Saturday, October 25 Time: 12:00 PM until 4:00 PM Place: Cost: Free

## The AGM Journal The AGM Journal

## Darreck Lisle Speaks

A Report of his visit and talk at AUoH (Amiga Users of the Heartland) September 16, 1997

D arreck Lisle  is  the  Public  Relations  and  Events Coordinator  for  Amiga,  Inc.  The  following  is  a report  of  his  talk  at  the  Amiga  Users  of  the Heartland meeting. …Bill Raecke

Mr. Lisle started off by telling the club how he got his job at Amiga, Inc. Basically, he got the job by continually offering his services until Gateway 2000 finally gave in. He stated he has an Amiga 1200 on his desk for work purposes, and an Amiga 4000T for home use. The A4000T at home has  an  060  card,  a  Catweasel  controller  with  two  HD floppies, and additional expansion equipment.

He also talked about why we haven't heard any press releases  from Amiga, Inc. License disputes and liquidator disputes need to be resolved before a press release can be approved.  The  Vice  President  hiring  process  is  nearing completion so, barring any further delays,  we  should  be hearing a press release soon.

Amiga International is the marketing arm of Amiga and is based in Germany. Amiga, Inc. is the R&amp;D arm of Amiga and is based in North Sioux City, South Dakota.

Darreck  then  went  on  to  talk  about  Amiga,  Inc.'s approach to marketing. Open licensing will be utilized to speed up development while Amiga, Inc. completes its startup cycle. One application for this open licensing could be in the area of Consumer Electronics where a small, highlystable  OS  is  critical.  Some  applications  he  speculated  on include a palmtop Amiga, an Amiga-based security system, Amiga-based  smart  homes  and  Amiga-based  cable  TV boxes. A comment was made how it would be bad for the system  running  your  house  to  crash  because  you  would have to reboot your house.

Companies are coming to Amiga, Inc. with requests to  receive  licenses  so  they  may  pursue  development  on Amiga-based  consumer  electronics  applications.  It  is Darreck's opinion that Amiga has a bright future because Amiga International and Amiga, Inc. are starting a cycle of slowly gaining momentum which will build in the upcoming months.

Another possible use of the Amiga technology may be  into  the  existing  Gateway  Destination  market.  This technology incorporates a TV into the computer so regular TV viewing is done on a 31" screen, but as a task on the computer. The current use of PCs  for this task has led to many  families  having  to  reboot  their  TV  often  due  to crashes.

Cooperation  with  third-party  developers  is  also  a priority as they are the driving force behind research and development at the present time.

Darreck also said that he thinks the time frame for the  release  of  AmigaOS  3.5  will  be  sometime  within  the next six months. AmigaOS 4.0 should be available before this time next year. AmigaOS 3.5 will use the existing 3.1 ROMs.

Amiga, Inc. is currently trying to collect all pertinent Amiga archives and technology. They are also attempting to  assemble  a  comprehensive  Amiga  library  of  Amiga books, service manuals, technical manuals, and any other writings pertinent to the Amiga's technology.

Amiga International is the marketing arm of Amiga and is based in Germany. Amiga, Inc. is the R&amp;D arm of Amiga and is based in North Sioux City, South Dakota.

Interaction with user groups is moving along. A user group network is in the works. (Editor's note: Just today I received an e-mail from an Amiga user group coordination effort. They plan on compiling information on all Amiga user group meetings and asking Amiga resellers to include a flyer with each package shipped.)

The purpose of the Developer Network is to assemble and  motivate  developers.  The Amiga, I n c . sponsored Developer  Network  should  be getting underway sometime around March or April of 1998. Backward compatibility to 3.0, 2.0  and  1.3  (if  possible)  is  a priority for new software, as is standardization  on  a  set  of issues.  Autoconfiguration  and plug-and-play software is also a priority.

Question and Answer Session

The  Q's  and  A's  are  not word-for-word,  but  are  taken from my notes.

One  of  the  people  who had just purchased AmigaOS 3.1 (it was being installed during the

![Image](1997_10_artifacts/image_000002_1639cd3c15ba74a7a621e48280a47d9044a9c893cad815180c9a817ca3334fc9.png)

club meeting) asked the following:

- Q: Should we buy AmigaOS 3.1?
- A: Yes… you will need the ROMs for the updated AmigaOS anyway.
- Q: Is Amiga, Inc. interested in the educational software market?
- A: Yes… we feel the Amiga is ideally suited to educational uses.
- Q: Is graphics card compatibility going to be built into the next OS release?
- A: Yes… some type of RTG standard should be included as well as an AHI-type of standard.
- Q: How long should we expect to wait before we see new systems?
- A: Probably around a year.
- Q: How many old Commodore employees are working for Amiga, Inc.?
- A: A rough estimate would be around 15 to 20. However, no former Commodore employee has turned us down and have said they will contract out to Amiga, Inc. if necessary to keep their present positions.
- Q: Are there any other enhancements to the Amiga you foresee?
- A: Possibly support for the Universal Serial Bus (USB).
- Q: Do you know how much Gateway 2000 bought the Amiga for?
- A: I wish I did, but I have no clue.
- Q: What is Amiga, Inc.'s position on UAE, the Amiga emulator available for Microsoft and UNIX?
- A: The current practice of pirating Amiga ROMs will be cracked down on shortly.
- Q: Will Amiga, Inc. use UAE to sway Microsoft and UNIX users to the Amiga?
- A: Probably not…the speed of the emulation on even the fastest Pentiums is only roughly equivalent to an unexpanded Amiga 500.
- Q: What does Amiga, Inc. think about Java?
- A: We would like to see Java in the next OS, but there is still a lot to be done in this area.
- Q: Is Amiga, Inc. considering a 'Power Up' style program like they had when the A3000 was released?
- A: That will most likely fall into the hands of the licensed Amiga-compatible makers to decide, but
- there are many uses for older Amiga systems. For instance, many technical schools modify Amiga systems for test equipment. Also, many cable channels use Amigas for the Preview Guide and also Public Service stations.
- Q: Are we going to see any of the current operating system hacks, such as MUI, built into a future AmigaOS?
- A: Possibly… however, MUI is too large and bulky to consider making it an integral part of the OS. A TCP stack is a definite possibility, though. Using Shareware and Public Domain OS software which is currently available is probably not an option, because programmers of competing software may claim Amiga, Inc. is showing favoritism by their choices. For instance, Amiga, Inc. currently buys most of its test equipment from many different Amiga mail-order houses for this very reason.
- Q: Will the prices of existing systems be dropped, like say $1000 off the existing A4000T prices?
- A: Yes… Amiga motherboards are quite simple in design so cost should reduce, especially after improvements are made to the current design, such as optimization of the existing custom chip set. Today's technology allows chip makers to reduce the size of the Amiga's custom chips.
- Q: Is Amiga, Inc. investigating the possibility of giving the Amiga the ability to run software written for other OSes?
- A: Yes… I believe there is some work involving making the Amiga a multi-platform machine. There is also the possibility of an Amiga-on-a-card which would effectively take over the processing of an industrystandard system making it essentially an Amiga.
- Q: Has Amiga, Inc. discovered a lot of reverse engineering of the Amiga technology?
- A: Yes-especially overseas.
- Q: Will Amiga, Inc. be coordinating with third parties?
- A: Yes… that is one of the main goals of Amiga, Inc.

Darreck said his goodbyes around 9:00 as he had to be up  for  a  7:00am  appointment,  and  he  had  two  hours  of driving ahead of him.

## Delfina Lite

## Taking the Amiga to New Audio Heights A Press Release

D elfina Lite is based on Delfina DSP, the world's first general  use  multifunctional  DSP  audio  card  for Amiga. From the Delfina DSP some functions have been deleted (serial/parallel ports, memory expansion) and some  functions  have  been  added  (multiple  sound  input, expansion port). The modern manufacturing allows a very low price: SRP is $299. Delfina Lite is primarily a DSP audio card, and it is best suited for producing and recording audio with optional realtime  effects.  Effects  can  be  applied  on  any  sound produced by Delfina or external source transparently, and all  the  sounds  produced  by  Delfina-capable  programs  or external source can be mixed into Delfina's output. Delfina Lite is also freely programmable for all general computing tasks using the supplied compiler and libraries. With the upcoming S/PDIF option Delfina Lite turns your  Amiga  into  a  professional  24-bit  computer  audio workstation. The optional serial port adds a new high-speed MIDI-capable  serial  into  your  computer  with  very  little

CPU usage.

## Catweasel

## The Advanced Floppy Controller A Press Release

C atweasel is a new floppy controller that works with standard  PC  disk  drives.  The  controller  handles Amiga and MS-DOS disks, no matter if they're DD or  HD formatted. The HD formats are even handled in higher  speeds:  PC-HD  disks  are  2.15  times  faster,  and Amiga  HD-disks  are  speeded  up  1.3  times.  This  can  be achieved because the Amiga-HD drives spin at 150 RPM as soon as you put a HD-Disk into the drive. The PC-drive on the other hand spins at 300 RPM, no matter what kind of disk you insert.

Additionally, a strength of the Catweasel controller is reading and writing extraneous formats: Macintosh, Atari 10/11 sector disks and Commodore 1581 disks can be used in a standard 3,5" low-cost drive*.

If you're connecting a 5.25" drive, even more formats can be handled: MS-DOS disks with 360K and 1200K open up  to  the  Amiga-world,  and  the  good  old  '64  disk  is honored in a special way: A filesystem for the Amiga OS is shipped with the catweasel, so you can copy the files from a 1541-disk using the shell or Directory Opus. Copying files for Emulators is no longer a problem, because a full disk is read within 12 seconds. A virtual file 'disk.info' shows an icon on the workbench, and another virtual file holds the .d64 image of the disk, as it's a standard in '64 emulators.

With a software update that's available in early '97, you can use floppy streamers with the Catweasel controller. With this sequential device you'll be able to backup your harddisks with AmiBack, Quarterback or Diavolo Backup. The  speed  will  be  about  2MB/minute.  Naturally,  this software update is free!

The controller is connected to the IDE port of the Amiga 1200/Amiga 4000. You can still connect 2 harddisks or  1  harddisk  and  1  CD-ROM.  To  be  compatible  to  the common 4-drive adaptors, a special adaptor is available for the clock-connector port in the Amiga 1200, and it's fully compatible to all  known turboboards and harddisks. No problems with the clock on the accelerator cards occur.

A Zorro-II version of the card is in the works. It will include some additional features, as there are: 3 IDE-Ports for cheap CD-Roms and harddisks, a bootrom for booting from Catweasel drives or a harddrive, and a local expansion port.  This  expansion  port  can  carry  an  optional  I/O module  with  2  serial  and  1  parallel  interface.  A  special sysop's I/O module will carry 8 serial ports. Each port has a 16-byte fifo to keep the interrupt-load low.

## Worms DC

by Eric W. Schwartz From the Amiga Gazette, Dayton, OH

M any of you have heard of Worms, especially since it has appeared on nearly every platform from PC to  Playstation.  It  originated  on  the  Amiga however, and Andy Davidson, the creator, decided to make a new AGA-only pumped up version with extra features, making this the best version of Worms currently existing and the 'Director's Cut' title particularly apt.

For those who don't know, Worms is a variation on the  old  Artillery/Scorched  Tanks  theme,  with  some 'Lemmings' sensibility and a lot of silliness thrown in. You control  a  team  of  four  worms  with  the  sole  purpose  of killing  one  or  more  other  teams  of  computer  or  humancontrolled worms. Each team member gets a limited time to get into position and take a shot at the opposition with a bazooka (standard weapon - calculate firing angle and shot power to hit the enemy, compensating for landscape and wind) or several other weapons, including homing missles, shotguns, mines, dynamite, and exploding sheep. Director's Cut adds new, sillier weapons such as three more types of sheep, homing pigeon, old ladies, the legendary Holy Hand Grenade, and the ever-popular mad cows. Some of the old weapons and utilities  are  beefed  up  or  changed  to  make them more useful. Basically, all these changes add up to the best version of Worms available anywhere - until Worms 2 shows up, and current info says that may never show on the Amiga.

The old Worms was at least partially configurable, to make playing more enjoyable, and it had the ability to load IFF  pics,  so  you  could  make  your  own  landscapes.  DC expands on this with extra colors afforded by AGA, and also gives you a prefs program to produce your own info and graphics to feed into the random landscape generator. You can also configure game settings, sound samples, and other good stuff. The game is not copy protected, installs easily on hard drive, and works beautifully on my A4000. It  seems much more bug-free than the original Worms. It can start from and quit to Workbench, work in NTSC and PAL, and minimize on Workbench when not in use. All it needs is graphic card support and a 'boss hotkey,' and it would be perfect. I only found one thing that did not work quite as advertised. The game settings appear to save, but will not load back into the game, so they're useless and you have  to  change  your  setting  manually  every  time.  Apart from that,  I  can't  find  a  thing  to  complain  about  in  the game, and that is a feat. (I do miss the CD music and video tracks of the C32 version, though.)

So, should you go out and buy this game? Unless you need  constant  frantic  action  or  you  only  play  RPGs,  I would say yes. Worms DC is very pretty, it's a fun game to …Continued on Page 7

## Billion Dollar Bill

What's a Billionaire To Do With All That Money?

From the Newsletter of the Champaign-Urbana Commodore Users Group

A t last count, Bill Gates had an estimated net worth of $42 billion dollars ($42,000,000,000.000). He has earned  since  his  birth  an  average  of  $32.31  per heartbeat, and this is escalating. He recently donated $200 million to place computers in libraries across the country. This is 1/210 of his wealth.

Here are some other things he could do:

- Pay NBA MVP Michael Jordan's salary for 1,394 years.
- Give every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth $7.00, and still have enough to live comfortably.
- Pay every California Lottery prize for the next 34 years.
- Fund 158 Mars Pathfinder missions.
- Fund the US Department of Education for 19 years.
- Pay tuition for the residents of Seattle and Tacoma to go to the University of Washington for four years.
- Fund the US presence in the Persian Gulf for 11 months.
- Fund the US peacekeeping forces in Bosnia for 157 years.
- Buy 233,346,297 copies of Microsoft Windows 95.
- Buy 1,680,000,000 copies of his own book, buy more with his royalties

35,000 sequels to Sling Blade.

- At the median donation for spending a night in the White House, he could stay in the Lincoln Bedroom for 46,300 years.
- If he wanted to go on a killing spree in Los Angeles County, at the rate that Simpson was charged, he could kill 3,360 people and pay all his attorney fees and punitive damages.
- At the rate of 1/2 ounce per $27 million, he could pay Mike Tyson to eat 1/5 of Evander Holyfield.
- He could fly from Seattle to Paris and back on Air France 45,258,621 times.
- If he wanted to go to a local baseball game, he could buy Seattle Mariners season tickets, all of them, for 411 years, and with his spare change could buy the team and the Kingdome.
- At Denny's, he could buy a Grand Slam Slugger Breakfast

![Image](1997_10_artifacts/image_000006_3ff3719f440079b2d4f738a4a72a6027a4259c9e1f185e085828ec4855cd3b63.png)

from those sales, continuing the cycle and easily become the best selling author of all time.

- Make Hanson the most successful musicians of all time by buying 3,529,411,765 copies of Middle of Nowhere.
- If he wanted to challenge George Lucas (worth only $2 billion), he could make 227 sequels to Waterworld, or

for 9,150,326,797 people.

- If he couldn't get service, he could buy every man, woman and child in China a Big Mac Extra Value Meal, as long as no one got Super Sizes.
- If they preferred, he could buy 17 billion packages of Top Ramen noodles.
- He must like

coffee, and could buy over 6 billion pounds of French roast at his local Starbuck's.

- Speaking of a cup of coffee, he could support one of those Sally Struther's foreign kids for 113,341,969 years.

Perhaps what he needs to spend money on most is a new pair of glasses and some hair conditioner. AGM

play for a short break or a long stint, and if there's something you don't like, you can probably change it. If you already own the original Worms, you may want to think about it a bit. DC doesn't offer a giant amount over the first game, but if you're a Worms fan, you'll get it anyway, like  I  did  -  and  if  you  do  own  Worms  classic,  you  may want to search out a bargain on DC, unlike I did.

The primary addition  is  support  for  Epson's  newest  printers:  the  400, 600, 800, 1520 and 3000.

In  the  September  issue,  I  reported  that  Miami,  the best of the TCP/IP stacks had been updated. Well, I have the same thing to report this time. Miami is now at version 2.1f. This update serves as a limited working copy for those wanting to try it out (it provides a limited connect time) or a fully functioning update for registered users.

This  month  brings  some  good  news  and  some  bad news  to  gamers.  The  good  news  is  that  we  have  new versions  of  Deluxe  Galaga  and  Deluxe  Pacman.  The  bad news is  these  will  be  the  final  versions…  the  author  has gone over to the dark side and won't be programming for the Amiga any longer. In the meantime, this is an excellent chance to get these classics. In my 'humble' opinion, these

are two of the best games ever written for the Amiga - and I'm  including  commercial  games  in  that  assessment.  For pure  enjoyment  and  playability  these  can't  be  beat.  If you've never played them, take this opportunity to do so. If  you  have  them  already,  be  sure  to  get  the  updates.  In either case, say goodbye to your free time. Thanks, Edgar M. Vigdal… we'll miss you.

Did you say you wanted to add to your collection of pictures? In the last month there have been 40 excellent pics added to our collection. For the most part they are animal pictures:  birds,  leopards,  seals,  fish,  crabs,  frogs…  even  a wart hog. You'll see some samples in the newsletter.

MCP (the Master Control Program) just keeps getting better and better. This month you'll find the official 1.30 release. MCP provides customization for your Amiga. And it does so many things that it replaces virtually every other commodity you have in  your  system.  There  is  a  gadget patch to improve the look of your Workbench; there is a mouse  blanker;  there  is  a  font  cache;  there  is  a  screen promoter; there is a screens menu that allows you to flip between  screens  via  a  menu  attached  to  the  screen

front/back  gadget;  and  far  too many  other  things  to  mention here. Just get it!

One  thing  MCP  doesn't  do  is improve  the  looks of  your menus…  or  provide pop-up menu feature. For that you need to get Magic Menu. The pop-up menu feature takes a little  time to get used to, but it can be a real time-saver. But whether you use that feature or not, you'll appreciate  the  way  the  menus look.  You  can  also  modify  the way the menus function if  you like.  You  can  even  have  them behave  more  like  Windoze  if that's  what  you  prefer.  It's  all configurable…  use  the  features you like - leave the rest turned off.

Datatypes?  Sure,  there  are  the normal  updates to the pict u r e . d a t a t y p e , t h e AKJFIF.datatype and the AKPNG.datatype. There are also GIF, IFF, ILBM and FAXX datatype updates. It pays to keep current.

## Meeting Notes

## Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

With the coming of the hottest  month of  the  year comes the least amount of news on what is going on with the  Amiga. No new Amigas, no new PowerPCs, and no new news. This is getting a bit old, but hope is still on the horizon.

Our meeting for August was a bit smaller than usual, but it was a very laid-back type of meeting. We had a very good  conversation  going  while  waiting  for  thing  to  get started on the main presentation. We had decided to see if we could figure out a problem on a 4000 owned by Ned Kelly. He bought a new JAZ drive, the 1 gigabyte removable drive from Iomega, and needed help setting it up. We had a lot of fun trying different things before deciding that the wrong termination was holding  us  up.  Later  we  found out  that  wasn't  the  case!  This was  fun  as  everyone  was  involved in some way, and interest was  high.  Maybe  sometime  in the  future  we  can  figure  it  out, completely.

September  usually  brings some cooling of the weather, and the end of summer. It also finally brought some news and rumors. The  first  PowerPC  accelerators have  been  shipped!  Some  speed comparisons  are  available,  and WOW  does  that  thing  move. What will happen next depends on  a  complex  chain  of  events. One being Apple possibly affecting  the  PowerPC  world. Another  great  story,  comes  in the form of what is going on at Gateway. The rumor is that they are  hiring  programmers,  technicians,  and  engineers  and  they have  a  new  building  for  the Amiga people.

Our  meeting  started  off tonight with news on our

METCOM that will not be called METCOM. You can read the details elsewhere in the newsletter. Come on out and at least say hello! We got some very favorable reviews from someone who discovered Deluxe Galaga on the BBS. It is a great arcade style game that can keep you playing for hours! We next discussed some printer problems, and some good news… Epson has decided to support the Amiga. If you haven't checked out their new 1440dpi inkjet printer line, then now may be the time. Show them we appreciate the support. We discussed available Internet service providers, and their prices. What a variety!

For our main presentation, we once again got Ned Kelly to bring  in  his  4000.  This  time  for  a  battery change,  or  so  we  thought.  Battery  replacement  in  our Amiga computers can get to be a necessity. Some Amigas have been around for a very long time now. While we don't have to worry about the Y2K bug, we do need to watch out for  dying  batteries.  After  dying,  the  battery  moves  to leaking and this can result in expensive damage. Since Ned had been noticing time problems - time set wrong after a cold boot - it was decided that changing the battery was a good idea. The problem is that dealers either don't carry the  battery,  or  they  don't  know  about  it.  I  encountered both types in searching. One guy told me you don't replace it, just plug this battery (he handed me a big black battery) into the connector next to that one on the motherboard.

Our installer got a bad steer as well. He was sold a Lithium battery (the Amiga uses a rechargeable Ni-Cad battery) that said  it  was  dangerous  to  recharge  as  it  could  explode. Discovering that ended that presentation. We quickly came up  with  an  alternate,  and  installed  MCP  on  the  system. MCP, now up to version 1.30, is the ultimate commodity that  can  do  it  all,  or  at  least  it  seems  to.  Many  things requiring lots of other programs can be accomplished by this one package. Check out the club library or BBS for this file, it is worth a look. Maybe next at the next meeting we can replace the battery, I found some at Fry Electronics!

## Amiga North Dallas Meeting Michael Turner

Our September meeting got off to a late start as  it took our esteemed President Gus a few minutes to quiet everybody down to call the meeting to order. Actually, I guess the meeting started early, it just took a few minutes for  any  sort  of  organization  to  catch  up!  Sort  of  an  organized chaos, if there is such a thing.

After Gus got a few words in to officially start the meeting, a few bits of news and rumors did surface. MUI is now updated again. Up to version 3.8? Also, Eddie mentioned  that  Gateway  has  either  broken  up  or  added  to Amiga Technologies so that there is an American company named Amiga Technologies now.

One member brought an A2000 that was having hard disk problems upon bootup so we all got to take a good look at the inside of an A2000. Thomas Dye figured out that the hard disk was, as the federal government would put it, '…in a functionally non-viable state…', and that solved the problem of the non-booting A2000.

Ned Kelly gave us a few tidbits about the upcoming Flea Market Extravaganza. It will be held in the Brookside

Recreation  Center  in  Hurst  on  Saturday,  October  25th from 12 noon to 4:00 p.m. There will be the flea market, the club's library, and Ned also mentioned he had a verbal promise from Commodore Country to be there. There will be no classes this year as the Rec Center is only one big room with no dividers, however there should be plenty to do and see if it is anything like last year!

Ken  Doll  has  graciously  agreed  to  be  the  North Dallas' Chapter official collector for the flea market. His phone number is 972-424-9782. Please contact him if you have  stuff  to  sell  at  the  flea  market  and  you  can  make arrangements to get your stuff to him and get a 'flea market sheet' to fill out.

Ned also had a couple of reminders concerning your flea  market  goods.  Items  will  not  be  accepted  later  than October 18th unless special  arrangements  are  made  with the  flea  market  collector.  Apparently,  there  were  some problems with people bringing items the morning of last year's MetCom. Please do not do this. This makes setting up a hassle and turns the paperwork into a headache for those who are unselfishly volounteering to do such things!

All flea market items will be picked up from the flea market after it is over by the flea market collector and you can collect all of your unsold items from him at a later date by arrangement. Please do not try to collect  any  unsold items right after  the  flea  market.  Again,  it  just  turns  the paperwork that has to be done later into a big mess!

Lastly,  the  end  of  the  century  is  just  around  the corner. There have been a lot of news stories about how all the  early  and  not-so-early  PCs  may  have  to  have  their clocks  and  the  programs  that  use  them  updated  to  keep them from crashing after 1999. Thomas Dye figured out that our Amiga clocks and software are good to the year 2099. Just one more way the designers of the Amiga were way ahead of everybody else at that time.

Anyway,the time for our next meeting is October 21 st at 7:30 p.m.  See Ya' There!
