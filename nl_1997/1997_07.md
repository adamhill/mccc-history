## The CDA Decision

## The Real Issues and The Reporting

On  the  26th  of  June,  the  US  Supreme  Court declared the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional.  The  statment  below is  a  response  to  that  ruling and  to  the  media  coverage  of  it.  I'm  including  Dale Larson's  opinion  here  because  I  couldn't  have  said  it nearly so well myself. …Bill Raecke As someone who has been online for many years and  whose  business  (http://www.iam.com)  depends heavily  on  the  Internet,  I  celebrated  today's  Supreme Court Decision to affirm the lower court's ruling that the Communications Decency Act is unconstitutional. The media has dampened my celebration, however, as  I  have  been  extremely  disappointed  in  much  of  the coverage on the ruling. I watched two television news reports on the subject this afternoon. Reporters continued to refer only to online porn and to protecting children, as if those were the only issues  involved.  The  Supreme  Court  decision  rendered today explicitly and directly contradicts that description of the CDA. Something much more important is going on here. The CDA was not intended solely to protect children or solely to apply to online porn. In fact, children have little access to the most hardcore online porn, and then only if the children go looking for it while parents choose not to provide direct or technological supervision. Other laws already cover red herrings like obscenity and child-pornography. The CDA was really about prying into the  lives  of  all  citizens,  child  or  adult,  to  enforce  a particularly narrow 'moral' agenda. Why else would the CDA have included, for  example,  a  clause  specifically banning from the Internet any discussion of abortion? The Supreme Court itself  called  into  question  the motives  of  congressional  legislators.  'This  uncertainty undermines the likelihood that the CDA has been carefully  tailored  to  the  congressional  goal  of  protecting minors  from  potentially  harmful  materials.'  The  Court went on to say, 'The breadth of the CDA's coverage is wholly  unprecedented.  The  general,  undefined  terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' cover large amounts of nonpornographic  material  with  serious  educational  or

Dallas other value.' Correctly  evaluating  the  true  effect  (and  intent)  of the  law,  the  court  concluded  'The  CDA,  casting  a  far darker shadow over free speech, threatens to torch a large segment  of  the  Internet  community'  and  to  have  an 'obvious chilling effect on free speech.' Fortunately, the court went much further than simply striking  down  the  CDA.  It  made  clear  that  the  Internet deserves to be afforded the highest protections of the first amendment.  It  is  a  perfect  haven  for  individual  and democratic freedom, with minimal potential for causing harm by inflicting one's speech (however unpopular) on those who don't wish to be subjected to it. The elements of our society who wish to control what is said, to make the rest of us conform to their 'wholesome' ideas for how we should act, will have to look somewhere other than cyberspace. Let them go back to boycotting Disney. The Court says that any future attempts at regulating the net must  be  defined  very  narrowly.  As  Bruce  Ennis,  lead attorney  for  the  suit  against  the  CDA,  said  about  the ruling, 'this is the legal birth certificate for the Internet.' I want to smoke a fine cigar to celebrate this birth of a more democratic and free media. I hope I can get the older popular media to join me.

Sincerely, Dale L. Larson

P.S.  I  discussed  the  CDA  in  some  detail  in  the forward I wrote to a recent book 'Torn Shapes of Desire: Internet Erotica,' and that essay is also available online at http://www.iam.com/tsd/tsd-foreword.html
