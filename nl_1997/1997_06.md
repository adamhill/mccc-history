Escom AG acquired AMIGA in April 1995. During this  time,  an  effort  was  made  to  revitalize  the  AMIGA market, however Escom went into financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy on July 15th, 1996. During this time, an effort was made to develop products, but due to financial difficulties,  there  has  not  been  any  significant  amount  of new product development by AMIGA over the past couple

of years. Since filing for bankruptcy, we have been trying to keep the marketplace alive through inventory sales by the trustee.

However, it has truly been AMIGA community that has  kept  AMIGA  alive  through  the  development  of products based on newer technology and software application developments.

Now that AMIGA is owned by a successful company - Gateway 2000 - there is a bright future.

-  Gateway 2000 is a solid and well established company in the computer industry
-  Gateway 2000 has consistently been honored with awards for products and service
- Gateway 2000 is the right partner to give AMIGA new life and energy for the future.

AMIGA  International  was  formed  as  a  US  based company in March, 1997 to acquire the assets of AMIGA Technologies GmbH. AMIGA International will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Gateway 2000.

Over  the  past  month,  we  have  been  very  busy finalizing the acquisition, performing due diligence, setting up  operations  in  Germany  and  communicating  with  the AMIGA community. We have a new office in Langen, next to the Frankfurt airport and I am happy to report to you that we are operational again. In Langen, we will have three people  handling  sales,  marketing  and  general  administration. We will be running at the beginning of June.

Since  early  April,  we  have  four  employees  in Braunschweig  that  are  taking  care  of  logistics  and warehousing,  orderprocessing  and  customer  support, Internet support as well as technical service. Finally, we are in the process of identifying an individual to manage new product development and R&amp;D.

What are we going to concentrate on? Implementing our strategy.

-  Supporting the existing AMIGA community
-  Leveraging the existing AMIGA technology through broad licensing
-  Assisting in developing new products based on open standards to the home computer and video/graphics market.

How will we support the community that has kept AMIGA alive?

-  Through conventions, press conferences, via the Internet, meetings and all useful initiatives coming from the AMIGA community. I have already been to conventions in Germany and in Sweden and will entertain any suggestions.
-  Continuing to sell to the distributor network that has supported AMIGA.
-  Working with developers through concepts such as the 'Open AMIGA Initiative' that is being formed with the support of many of the prominent names in the AMIGA community.

The  basics  of  success  in  this  project  is  to  work together  with  partners  and  to  define  a  common  path  of development. The AMIGA market can not afford a split, we must go together into one direction.

For  us  to  keep  the  market  alive  it  is  neccessary  to assist  many  companies  in  developing  products  through broad  licensing.  Our  licensing  policy  will  be  very  open, broad and focus on licensing and standard O/S, Chipsets and the trademarks. Also, licensing will allow the AMIGA to  be  spread  to  many  different  embedded  applications  in field  such  as  medical  solutions,  simulation  applications, fitness equipment, irrigation systems and kiosk terminals. Of course, we are looking for new partners.

Through  licensing  and  focused  R&amp;D  managed  by AMIGA International, we plan to assist the market place in developing new products for the AMIGA.

We are currently exploring many of the possible new products that have been suggested including such things as an operating system upgrade and new hardware platforms. We would like to keep the procedure as simple as possible.We need to talk with the technology companies from the  AMIGA business and exchange know-how. It is also important that we explore an open AMIGA platform, use industry  standard  components  to  make  it  cheaper  to produce,  faster  to  develop  and  easier  to  upgrade.  These things  need  to  happen  quickly,  but  in  a  very  managed fashion. With this strategy and the support of the AMIGA community and Gateway 2000, we are convinced there is a

Gateway CEO takes on Goliath - by Jai Singh, May 20,  1997  -  Burlingame,  California:  When  Larry  Ellison rails  against  the  Microsoft-Intel  power  axis,  the  general reaction  is  that  Larry  is  just  being  Larry.  But  when  Ted Waitt implies the same, you had better listen.

The chairman and CEO of Gateway, speaking here today  at  the  PC  Tech  Forum,  implied  strongly  that  the duo's  stranglehold  on  the  personal  computer  industry  is not good for customers.

Asked in a brief interview with CNET's NEWS.COM how his vision matches up with Bill Gates' oft-stated goal of 'Windows on every desktop,' Waitt did not  directly  answer  the  question.  But  he  did  say  the operating system gets too much attention.

Waitt said the OS should be 'hidden away' and that

![Image](1997_06_artifacts/image_000003_38901cbc74dc226768a2039b933f4bdc4fcbd9de333d3db3948d2a5bb2a0882b.png)

Waitt said the OS should be 'hidden away' and that what users need is a 'front end, a navigational tool' that would allow them to simply do their work. 'It should be a sort of a browser-centric world'…

what users need is a 'front end, a navigational tool' that would allow them to simply do their work. 'It should be a sort of a browser-centric world,' he said. Waitt pointed out that  users  spend  27  percent  of  their  time,  on  average, fiddling with Windows.

Waitt  didn't  pull  any  punches  during  his  speech either. 'We can't let the creators of this technology lead and the world follow blindly… We should not allow ourselves to  be  intimidated by some technology companies,' Waitt told the audience of engineers and industry analysts.

Asked later whether he thinks Microsoft and Intel are the  intimidators,  Waitt  said,  'You  can  read  between  the lines.'

Waitt's  comments  are  extraordinary,  coming  from the head of a company that has reaped tremendous financial rewards  from  the  Microsoft-Intel  duopoly  and  over  the years  has  been  one  the  greatest  proponents  of  the  two companies' model for the PC industry.

Waitt's general theme is that personal computers need to be more accessible, easier to use, functional, and affordable, elements that are often lost in the industry's zeal to innovate.

'Technology for technology's sake is not innovation,' he told the audience. 'What we in the industry have to be concerned about is what products do, as opposed to what the processing power is.'

The  Internet  is  having  a  great  influence  on  how people  use  the  personal  computer,  according  to  Waitt. Users, he said, are increasingly interacting with content and information,  and  in  that  environment  'the  operating system will be less important than the content.'

Waitt also implied there were alternatives to Intel's chips. He told NEWS.COM that AMD's K6 'is a pretty good  processor.'  He  refused  to  comment  on  whether Gateway is considering building a non-Intel PC but did say that Gateway is 'always evaluating new technologies.'

The key to Gateway's success, he said, is keeping the customer at the forefront.

'Customers should be able to put their trust in us to take them to their destination,' he said. 'Companies that are closest to the customers are the ones who are going to lead the industry.' AGM

## WP Shootout

## Final Writer vs. Wordworth - Which is the Best? by Bill Raecke

T here are two major word processors for the Amiga that are still being supported and updated. Within the  past  few  months,  both  have  received  major upgrades.  Final  Writer  is  now  being  marketed  under  the name Final Writer 97. It was last updated on March 7 of this  year.  Wordworth  is  now  Wordworth  6  and  was  last updated on December 4, 1996. I have used Final Writer for a  number of years now - since the days of Final Copy. I bought Wordworth a year or two ago when Soft Logik had some kind of a sale that I was unable to resist. But, even though I owned Wordworth, I never paid much attention to  it.  I  continued  to  use  Final  Writer  out  of  habit  and loyalty.  With  the  latest  upgrades  to  both  programs  I thought I owed it to myself to compare the two to determine which one was really the best. And now that I have made my choice, I'll share my findings and my opinions with you here. I should probably mention at the outset that all my tests were done on my Amiga 2000 equipped with a 33mhz 68040 processor, 32 meg of fast RAM, 2 meg of chip RAM, a  Picasso  II+  graphics  card  with  2  meg  graphics memory, and the CyberGraphX RTG system.

## The Interface

Both  programs  have  modern  functional  interfaces. Both have standard Amiga menus, of course. But both also have the rows of buttons that have become the standard in most modern programs that allow you to open, save, print, center  text,  etc.  without  resorting  to  the  use  of  menus. Wordworth has a nice navigation bar at the bottom of the screen  that  allows  you  to  switch  pages  and  change  magnification level very quickly. Final Writer provides similar functionality,  but  it's  not  as  easy  to  get  to  or  as  goodlooking.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  overall  appearance  of Wordworth is far superior to my eyes.

Actually,  the  quality  of  the  display  is  not  totally subjective. I tried displaying the same document using the same typeface and point size in both products combined with a magnification level that made the documents appear the  same  size  on  the  screen.  Wordworth  is  definitely  a cleaner, clearer display. That makes it easier to work with. I'm using an 800 x 530 256-color CyberGraphX screen. On lower  resolution  screens  the  difference  is  even  more noticeable.  With  cleaner,  more  legible  text  and  a  crisper, better-looking display overall, Wordworth wins the general look and feel contest hands down.

How about typing speed? Can the products keep up? Well, Final Writer can keep up if you're a slow typist, but even I can notice the sluggishness in the response. There is no apparent slowness in the Wordworth response. It's fast. Likewise  in  the  area  of  screen  scrolling.  Wordworth  is simply  faster  and  more  responsive.  This makes it much more pleasurable to work with.

Let's get back to those button rows. In  each  program  there  are  actually  two rows of buttons: one standard set and one

![Image](1997_06_artifacts/image_000005_09c56936d8e274b963c39d3f6a18ee8b3932959312387df6b348bb5e3257af08.png)

that can be defined by the user - that is, you can select the buttons  that  will  actually  appear  on  the  row  of  buttons from a large list of choices available within the program. Actually, the buttons that are user-chosen do not have to appear as a row at all, but can appear as a column on either the left or right of the window as well as a row at the top or bottom. Differences between the two programs? Well, Final Writer 97 allows you to define up to eight rows of buttons that can be used for different purposes - you can switch between the pre-defined sets. Wordworth allows just one set of buttons but adds the additional display option of placing the buttons in a floating window. This setup makes displaying a greater number of buttons more practical than with a single row. Pretty much a draw here - you give up something with either product.

Another important interface feature is the availability of online help. There are many times - especially when you are just learning a program - when you need to know how to  perform  a  certain  task.  There's  always  the  written documentation, of course, but it is a lot easier to look up a quick  answer  using  the  on-line  help  system.  All  modern programs  have  an  on-line  help  system,  right?  Actually, Final Writer seems to have omitted this important feature. Wordworth,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  nice  on-line  help system. Press the help key, or use the help button, or use the help menu, and a nice AmigaGuide document will pop up. If you press the help key while selecting a menu item, context sensitive help will pop up explaining the use of that particular menu item.

## Word Processing Features

Both programs offer spell checkers, of course. And both offer automatic spell correction and word completion from a  list  that  you  can  build  and  update  whenever  the need arises.  The  only  major  difference  here  is  that  Final Writer fails to offer a 'Replace All' function with its spell checker.  So,  if  you  have  consistently  misspelled  a  word throughout your document, you get to correct it multiple times instead of just once like you can with Wordworth.

Both  Final  Writer  and  Wordworth  offer  a  built-in Thesaurus  and  both  seem  to  be  functionally  equivalent. Wordworth's Thesaurus,  however,  sports  a  better  layout and is, therefore, a little easier to use.

Grammar checking is  one  area  where  Final  Writer

really stands out. That's primarily because Wordworth fails to offer the feature at all. Final Writer's grammar checker is quite functional and is the equivalent of any you can find on any platform.

Tables. Every modern word processor is supposed to offer  the  capability  to  add  tables  to  a  document...that  is, rows  and  columns  into  which  data  can  be  entered.  The table frames can be optionally printed as well, which can add a nice look to your document. Both Wordworth and Final  Writer  offer  frames  capability,  but  each  has  its strengths and weaknesses. Wordworth offers the ability to sort data within tables...Final Writer does not. Wordworth offers the ability automatically sum columns of data...Final Writer  does  not.  Wordworth  offers  the  standard  way  of entering data into a table (using the tab key)...Final Writer does not. Wordworth can import a table from Turbocalc (a spreadsheet)...Final Writer does not offer any table import functions. Final Writer allows the user to specify the width of  the  columns  in  the  table  before  creation...Wordworth does  not.  (Either  product  will  allow  the  width  of  the columns  to  be  modified  after  creation  by  grabbing  the column's  vertical  bar  with  the  mouse  and  dragging,  but neither offers a way to ensure that the column widths are consistent after table creation.) Overall, I think Wordworth gets the edge here, but I do wish they would allow column width to be specified and modified.

If you are writing any kind of reference work, you're going to want to use footnotes. It's pretty much of a 'must' for any high school or college student. Both Final Writer and Wordworth support 'end notes' - the kind of footnot- ing  where  all  the references are pl a c e d i n a separate section at t h e end of a document.  Only Wordworth offers true footnoting where  the  notes can appear at the bottom of the page containing the referenced material.

Final Writer offers a nice capability to specify  document 'sections.' The standard  sections are main, outline, title page, preface, table of contents, table  of  illustrations,  end  notes,

May 29, 1997 8:55 Chip: 1,667K Fast: 12,206K

bibliography,  and  index.  Of  course,  sections  such  as  the table  of  illustrations  and  the  index  are  linked  to  specific points  in  the  'main'  section  so  that,  as  the  document  is edited, the page numbers are always kept up to date. Each of the sections of the document can have its own format. You select the section to work on and the other sections are kept  out  of  the  way  until  you  want  to  edit  them. Wordworth handles  the  separate  sections  as  style  sheets. You specify a desired style  for  a  page...the  styles  are  unlimited. The Wordworth method of handling sections of a document more closely mimics the way this kind of thing is handled on other platforms, but I think that Final Writer is superior in this regard.

## Printing

The  primary  purpose  of  a  word  processor  is  to produce  words  on  a  printed  page.  So,  obviously,  a  comparison  needs  to  be  made  of  the  two  programs'  print capabilities. To test them, I imported a document into each program,  made  sure  the  margins,  typeface,  font  size  and print settings were identical (600dpi black and white)...and then I printed the page using each product. I kept my hands off  the  keyboard  during  printing  to  make  sure  I  wasn't impacting the results by multitasking. Final Writer took 5 minutes and 3 seconds to print the page. Wordworth took just  4  minutes  and  18  seconds  -  15%  faster.  (By  way  of comparison,  PageStream  3.2  takes  just  3  minutes  and  40 seconds to print the same page using the same fonts, layout and printer  settings.  That's  27%  faster  than  Final  Writer and  15%  faster  than  Wordworth.  Looks  like  they  could

both  use  a  little speeding  up.)  By t h e way, t h e printed output derived from each of t h e t h r e e products does not differ at all in quality.

Wordworth offers some  other  print capabilities to add to its already superior  printing speed. First is the ability to do b a c k g r o u n d printing. That means  that  you c a n s e n d a document  to  the printer  and  then continue to work with  Wordworth while  the  docu-

ment prints. The printing will be slower, of course, depending on how heavily you are using Wordworth, but, since you are able to continue working, that's not as important. Final Writer has no background printing capability.

Wordworth also has a special print feature available to anyone who uses an HP Laserjet 3, 4 or 5. If you use one of these printers, and if you restrict your font usage to only Compugraphic  Intellifonts,  Wordworth  can  speed  up printing by downloading the fonts to the printer and then sending  the  text  to  the  printer.  This  is  instead  of  the standard method of converting the document to a bitmap and sending the graphical representation to the printer. Not having an HP Laserjet, I was not able to test this capability, but the test results I have seen indicate that printing speeds are more than six times as fast, although that undoubtedly varies with the speed of the processor.

## Miscellaneous

Page 1

Let's talk about font selection. Both Final Writer and Wordworth support the use of Compugraphic Intellifonts; and both support the use of Postscript fonts. In addition, Final Writer supports its own non-standard 'Nimbus' font technology. Only Wordworth supports the use of TrueType fonts, the current industry leader in font technology. But how  they  handle  the  selection  of  these  fonts  is  quite different.

Final Writer first. Final Writer is very sloppy about the  way  it  handles  any  font  types  other  than  its  own Nimbus fonts. You have to either know or remember that the file you want to select for a Postscript font is the one

ARC

16

FGC\_\_\_\_\_.PFB.  The  same  clumsiness  occurs  with Compugraphic  Intellifonts  and,  of  course,  you  aren't allowed to use TrueType fonts at all. In practice, that means that you will probably find yourself using only Softwood's Nimbus fonts.  That's  OK  I  guess,  but  it  means  you  are using a different set of fonts for Final Writer than you use in  any  other  program  -  and,  since  Nimbus  fonts  are peculiar to Softwood and are relatively very expensive, that set  of  fonts  will  likely  be  much  more  limited  than  the selection of fonts you already have or can obtain inexpensively elsewhere.

Wordworth  handles  its  fonts  entirely  differently. There is no way to select a font using a file requester from within the program. Instead, all fonts you are going to use have  to  be  pre-processed  using  an  external  program supplied with Wordworth called, logically, 'InstallFonts.' Using InstallFonts is simple enough. Just click on the icon and then use the file requester to point to the directory that holds the fonts you want to add. The idea of having to run a  separate  program  to  make  fonts  known  to  Wordworth sounds  less  than  ideal  at  first  glance  until  you  see  the results. It means that you don't have to go searching around on the disk looking for your fonts every time you want to use one that hasn't been pre-loaded, and it means you don't have  to  remember  that  it's  the  file  name  with  the  .PFB suffix you want to select. It also means that Wordworth will display the real font name to you rather than the file name. Actually, I think the only way to improve on this setup is to make the capability to add fonts available from within Wordworth itself rather than externally - like PageStream

does.

A couple of other things  are  worth mentioning in this section. Only W o r d w o r t h supports font kerning.  Kerning information is stored  as  part  of the  font  definition. It specifies the amount  of overlap  between two characters in a  typeface.  For example, the letters  A  and  V should be kerned to overlap i n order to avoid an ugly  white  space between  the  two l e t t e r s . With Final Writer, you with the .PFB suffix. And, guess what?  It  appears in the list of fonts as  filename.PFB. Ugly, at best. Actually, i t ' s worse  than  ugly, because t h e f i l e n a m e of a Postscript  font  is often different than the font n a m e . F o r example, I have a file  name  in  one of my f o n t directories  called FGC\_\_\_\_\_.PFB. The  name  of  the font  is  Franklin G o t h i c Condensed, but Final Writer shows it to me as

are stuck with the ugly white space. With Wordworth, you are not.

Another thing that I found particularly helpful when working with Wordworth were the formatting buttons. For example, there is a button to reformat text as bulleted text. Simply highlight the text, click the button, and your text is bulleted. Click the button again and it reverts to the way it was before. Final Writer has a menu item to add bullets to text...but if you select it a second time it doesn't revert to the  way  it  was.  There  are  other  buttons  offered  by Wordworth such as shifting text to the right or left that work just  as  slickly  as  the  bullet  button  does.  They  are better than anything Final Writer offers.

## Desktop Publishing Features

I placed this section at the  end  for  one  simple reason. Being a PageStream user, I feel these capabilities are not of particular i mportance. Neither product comes even close to offering the capabilities of a true desktop publishing package.  (Neither  does  a desktop publishing package come close to offering some of the capabilities of a word processor -indexing, footnoting,  etc.  They  are different  products  intended for different uses.) The only reason  I  include  the  comparison  at  all  is  that  both products tout their desktop publishing capabilities...in fact,  this  is  the  primary have included. Both products allow you to flow text to the right  or  left  of  a  text  object  (far  inferior  to  the  options available in a desktop publishing package). But Wordworth offers lots of other options for a text object. They call the group of features 'Text FX.' It provides such things as the ability to rotate, spiral and add shadows to text.

How about a quick look at the drawing tools? Both Final Writer and Wordworth supply tools with which to draw lines, squares, circles, etc. Wordworth has an option for  a  box  with  rounded  corners  that  I  haven't  found  in Final  Writer.  It  also  has  a  polygon  drawing  tool  which allows you to build a polygon with any number of sides. Both products allow objects to be grouped and resized as a group. Only Final Writer allows the group of objects to be rotated.

difference between Final Writer 97 and the previous Final Writer. Also, I suppose there are some users out there who don't have PageStream and who might find a use for the simple desktop publishing tools found here.

Both  products  allow  you  to  import  a  bitmapped picture, to flow text to the right or the left, to have straightline text flow or contoured text flow around the shape of the  image,  to  scale  the  picture,  and  to  maintain  or  not maintain the original relative height and width proportions. Final  Writer  gets  a  little  nod  in  its  favor  here,  however, since  Wordworth is  unable  to  import  a  JPEG  image  -  a rather amazing omission since I have a datatype that will handle the import just fine. Apparently Wordworth is not datatype aware.

Text  frames  are  now  supported  by  both  products. Think of a text frame as a stand-alone rectangle filled with text  that  can  then  be  moved  around  on  the  page.  It's  a standard  desktop  publishing  feature  that  both  products

## Summary

I  feel  like  a  traitor.  I've been using Final Writer for years now and I went into this  comparison  with  a t o t a l l y open mind. Unfortunately, Final Writer simply can't measure up to today's  competition.  An unbiased comparison shows Wordworth to be the superior product in all but a  couple  of  categories.  I have  changed  my  default word processor t o Wordworth  for  the  time being.  I  still  have  Final Writer  97  installed  on  my hard  drive  and  the  next time it is updated I'll purchase  the  upgrade  and compare again. But in the meantime, it's Wordworth 6 for me.

The Best of The BBS - On Disk by Bill Raecke

M CCC-A\_1248 Soliton: It's the best implementation of Solitaire I've seen. You can even design your own card set and window background (or use one of the alternatives that others have designed). It requires MUI.

Datatypes: There are several here. You simply never know when you might need a datatype. On this disk are datatypes  for  executables,  for  IFF  pictures  and  for Metaview documents (.PDF files).

Pictures:  There's  an  outstanding  picture  here  of  a tiger in some tall grass.

## MCCC-A\_1249

Miami 1.21:  Here  is  the  latest  version  of  Miami  in archived format. There is a demo version here as well as updates for registered users. For those still unfamiliar with Miami, it's the best and easiest to use TCP/IP client for the Amiga.  (TCP/IP  is  the  connection  that  allows  you  to connect to the Internet.) The biggest new feature in this version  is  the  addition  of  https://  (secure  connection)

support. It works with any product that is set up to use the Miami setup - currently only Voyager NG.

## MCCC-A\_1250

Miami\_1.21: This disk contains the portion of Miami that allows the secure connection I mentioned earlier.

Datatypes: On this disk are the latest versions of the akSVG (Superview),  akLJPG  (lossless  JPEG)  and  akJFIF (JPEG) datatypes. Enough said.

## MCCC-A\_1251

Datatypes:  This  disk  contains  the  latest  akPNG (PNG) datatype and the latest animation datatype.

Pictures: Beautiful pictures here of butterflies, a bird and a wolf. Well worth adding to your collection.

## MCCC-A\_1252

Pictures: Six pictures in all. Lions and Polar Bears. All excellent. AGM

## The April &amp; May Meetings of the Amiga by the Loop Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

Chapter

April has the unfortunate distinction of having to live with  April  Fool's  Day.  This  day  seems  to  bring  out  the worst in April. April has been bad for the Amiga as well. I wonder if it is because they both start with the letter A, have five  letters,  and  have  female  sounding  names.  April '94, '95, and '96 all brought news to the Amiga world. Two were  bad  one  was  good  that  turned  bad.  As  April  '97 approached,  I  wondered  what  would  happen  this  time. Strangely  enough,  March  27  brought  news  of  Gateway's intentions  of  buying  the  Amiga.  This  news  appeared  to come out of nowhere, and rumors of an elaborate April Fool's Joke began appearing everywhere. Fortunately, the truth came out and Gateway was indeed proceeding with just this idea. By doing this before April started, I thought maybe they can break the pattern. Then it was pointed out that  the  purchase  had  to  be  approved.  I  thought,  oh  no, they will announce this in April, and then what, a great flood washes them away! Though it seemed to take forever, April  came  and  went  with  nothing  but  rumors.  They waited till May 16, 1997, to let us know that Gateway truly does own the Amiga. The Amiga has a home, and we can have hope.

April brought about a twist for our meeting. We were forced to return to our old location for the month due to changes being made at our usual location. Unfortunately, we were forced into the smallest room we have had to use, and by coincidence the most people I have seen in awhile showed up! It began to look like standing room only. I am sure that some of those people came to find out the latest on  the  Gateway  news,  unfortunately,  there  was  nothing beyond the  initial  news.  We  had  a  good  time  though  as Mark Stodola  gave  a  presentation  on  the  latest  software from  IAM.  IAM  represents  a  company  made  up  of  two previous  Commodore  employees,  Dale  Luck  and  Dave Haynie, offering several useful software packages for Amiga users.  One  of  these,  DiskSalv,  offers  software  that  can recover data from your hard drive and floppies… something that can save you a lot of frustration if you have it at the right time. As interesting as that was, the sound file presentation Mark concluded with got audience response, many of  them  asking  for  more.  Thanks  for  the  presentation Mark!

May  took  us  to  another  location  to  hold  our meetings.  Due  to  happenings  beyond  our  control,  our meeting location has a new home. The new Bell Helicopter Training facility, located near the previous location, gives us a well equipped (except for phone lines) meeting room with nice chairs and tables, and a nice location. Best of all, it's still free. With no new news about what is going on, we did not  have  much  to  discuss.  We  may  or  may  not  have MetCom this year. Due to our sagging numbers in membership, we may not be able to afford to have MetCom. That seems a bit sad, as I have looked forward to this event every year.

One of the people attending the meeting has a real rarity. He offered its use to all of us…a BBS for Amigas. It is called Trucker's Place and the number is (817)735-8308. At one time there were fourteen numbers in my phonebook just for Amiga BBSs. Today I have just two. The club BBS and Trucker's Place. There are a few others in the area, I understand,  but  I  have  yet  to  try  them.  I  have  used Trucker's Place since he started a few years ago, and he has tried to keep it working and up-to-date the best he could. If you are tired of waiting for a connection on the Internet, give him a call and try his BBS out.

Tonight's presentation gave us a look at fax software. With no phone lines we were limited to a showing of the software with explanation of the various functions. Once again David Owens dragged his 3000 out of its cozy place at home to show us GPFax and STFax. GPFax comes from the people who give us Directory OPUS, all the way from Australia.  The  other,  STFax,  is  a  relatively  new  piece  of software  that  comes  in  the  form  of  shareware.  Thanks again, David, for the presentation! Hopefully with the news out on Gateway, we will have something to talk about for the next meeting on the subject. Come on out and see our new meeting room, and share the good news.

## AMIGA NORTH DALLAS Amiga North Dallas Meeting Michael Turner

Well,  the  first  big  news  was  our  new  location  by Addison Road just off the Tollway. President Gus Rieter had  suggested  the  location  at  our  last  meeting.  Since  he works there, he was obviously familiar with the facilities. And what facilities they were! With a computer projection screen, telephone hook-ups,and very 'comfee' chairs, the only thing missing was room-service!

The meeting started with the usual rumours and odd tidbits of information. Especially discussed was the rumor of Gateway's buyout of Amiga Technologies and just what Gateway  had  planned  for  the  Amiga,  if  anything.  Then there followed an explanation of the different processors of the 68000 family and the capabilities of each (I instegated that  one).  Thomas  Dye  mentioned  he  had  a  CSA  68030

with 4 Meg of memory accelerator board for sale. Another member  had  bought a 112K modem  but  didn't have a power supply and wondered what and where to get one.

After  a  few  more  technical  questions  and  niceties were taken care of, Thomas and Gus put that huge projection  screen  to  good  use  by  'surfing  the  Web'  with  Gus' '040 Amiga 2000. Gus demonstrated a couple of different Web Browsers such as Voyager and AWeb and went thru their different capabilites, limitations, odd quirks (and, of course,  bugs).  After  a  few  technical  problems  and,  thus, another minor technical discussion, we were off cruising the Web in all its information and graphical glory on a 10ft by 10ft SVHS screen. After visiting a couple of Amiga sites and a couple of more eccentric sites, it was time to end the meeting. A good time was had by all and a few of us even learned something!

Since this was our first meeting in this building (and since Gus' directions worked so well ) I'll repeat them here: Take the Tollway north from 635. Exit Keller Springs. Take the  service  road  to  Westgrove,  turn  left  onto  Westgrove.

Turn North at Addison Road (2nd light). Then go north up Addison Rd until you see a 2 story black glass building on the right. Enter the parking lot  and park at the front of the building with the corner cut out of it.

Unfortunately,the building doors lock themselves at 7:00 p.m. and our meeting doesn't meet until 7:30 p.m. In order  to  get  around  this  problem,  Gus  has  purchased  a cheap pair of walkie-talkies and left one by the front door. If anyone is late and needs in, just pick up the walkie-talkie, turn it on, push the talk button and say hello, and someone will  be  down  in  just  a  minute  to  let  you  in.  Gus  also mentioned you could also call 972-931-9005 ext 291 if that doesn't work. This seemed to work pretty well. If you have any questions beforehand you can call him at 972-713-8660 (home) or 972-931-9005 ext 207 (work) and ask for Gus. You can also give me a call a 972-216-9138 if none of those work.

As usual we'll meet again on the third Tuesday of the month in June at 7:30 p.m.  See Ya'll There! AGM
