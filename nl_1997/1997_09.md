What is an Amiga user, today and tomorrow?

What's  an  Amiga  enthusiast?  More  than  5  years ago, we would have received a wide variety of answers from  gamers  to  video  professionals,  artists,  business people, and the majority of users just wanting to do the odd thing. It would not be uncommon to find an Amiga user  that  kept  track  of  their  genealogy  data,  played around with their paint programs, and occasionally used a word processor to write letters to friends and relatives. They might even try to dabble in an area with a steep learning curve like writing an ARexx script. Well, times have changed. Things are tighter now. Interests  are  more  finely  tuned  in  the  Amiga.  Is  this  a good thing? I'm reminded of a series of novels written by Isaac Asimov, the Foundation Trilogy, in which a character develops a new science that allows mankind to predict mankind's  future.Note  that  this  is  different  than  being able  to  predict  the  future  of  one  person.  This  theory mathematically  reduced  the  entire  human  population down to  a  series  of  generalized  algorithms.  When  the character  applied  his  theory  to  his  present  time  he discovered  that  the  current  empire  would  eventually crumble  and  the  entire  human  population  that  was presently spread across millions of planets would fall into anarchy.  In  order  to  circumvent  this,  he  planned  for  a Foundation to be established as far from the center of the Empire as possible. Time passed. Since the Foundation's planet was very low on natural resources, and because trade  with  the  empire  was  failing,  the  Foundation's scientists  and  engineers  resorted  to developing  their  newer  technologies as  small  as  possible.  This  resulted  in very  high  technology  that  was  so miniaturized  that  people  just  a  few planets away thought it was magic. I'm  sure  you're  wondering  how I'm going to connect this to the present Amiga  situation.  Well,  just  as  the empire's  failing  trimmed  the  techogy,  I  feel  that  the  passing  of  the nological fat off science and technolAmiga's  golden  era  have  forced  and

Dallas will  force  many  people,  developers  and  users  alike,  to rethink the way they use their Amiga.

One benefit, I hope, is that the Amiga's operating system(s)  will  be  more  robust  and  more  full-featured while  still  retaining  their  relative  lightness  of  being.  In addition, I'm hoping that the Amiga's operating system(s) will not only be developed for other processor platforms, but  that  other  operating  systems  will  be  ported  to  the Amiga hardware platform.

Another benefit is that Amiga users will have been more receptive of other operating systems and platforms. After all, one reason most of us enjoy using computers is to learn new things. It certainly stretches our imaginations and capabilities when we learn an entirely new computer platform. How does this provide an improvement for the Amiga computer user? First, they'll be better equipped to learn  new  programs.  Second,  they'll  learn  to  segregate their computer uses between one platform and another, thus  tailoring  their  computing  sessions  to  the  software that is best able to handle the task at hand.

The past three years have forced developers to be more particular when designing their programs. It's also forced users to be more receptive of the sparse offerings from Amiga developers. This miniaturization, or tightening,  of  resources  has  cleansed  a  lot  of  the  fat  from  the Amiga  community.  Unfortunately,  the  lack  of  software development  has  also  caused  us  to  lose  some  of  our muscle. We have a long way to go before we are in good health again.

So, what is an Amiga enthusiast today? Hopefully, it is a user that can choose to perform their various computing  tasks  according  to  the  abilities  of  their  multiple

computers.  It's  my  sincere  hope  that this  will  bring  forth  a  new  class  of users that have a profound respect for their preferred computer. If we can go through 3 years of difficult times and continue  to  appreciate  using  our Amiga computers, imagine the nirvana we  will  experience  when  we  are headed on a good course with an able helmsman.

Remember:  Only  Amiga  makes  it possible. …Ric Fischer, Arizona Amiga User Group
