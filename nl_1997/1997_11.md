## Flea Market - AGM Web Site - Vote for Jay

The Flea Market Extravaganza This isn't the official report. Since the Flea Market Extravaganza just took place a couple of days ago, there hasn't  been  time  to  gather  all  the  data  and  put  all  the pieces together - check the December issue for a more thorough report - but here are a few quick facts. We had 10 members renew their current memberships, we had 2 renew their expired memberships, and we had two new members join us. Ten people signed up for the BBS. In all we had 60 people register  (although  actual  attendance was probably higher)…26 of those were visitors. I wonder how come they're not members. My impression  was  that  the  show  was  a  success. The flea  market  tables  were  full  with  lots  of  used  bargains,  and  Commodore  Country  had  lots  of  new  hardware and software, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Here's hoping that our membership will grow and allow next year's event to be a full-fledged METCOM once again. If Gateway comes through with some new computers - and markets them - it could happen.

The AGM Web Site If  you don't know by now, it's time you found out…  the  AGM  has  a  site  on  the  web.  The  high points? Well, the AGM Journal is on-line. In fact my monthly article featuring by picks of the best of the BBS  uploads  is  there,  complete  with  software downloads. You'll also find the calendar of events and maps to the meeting places. One rather unique feature is the member list. If you e-mail me your e-mail address, I'll list it on the web site. In fact, I'll list your personal web site as well if you have one. This should be an excellent way for members  to  keep  in  touch  with  each  other.  The Internet is a great way for people to communicate, but you  have  to  know  those  addresses.  So  far  I've  just heard from a few of you. I'd like to be able to list everyone, but I need your input to do it. Anyway,  take  a  look.  Let  me  know  what  you think. Anything else you'd like to see out there?

Vote For Jay I just received this e-mail via the address associated with our club web site. Sounds like a good idea. Hi Fellow Amiga Nuts, I  am Jerry Smith a long time Amiga user and I ran across a site that you might want to look at and maybe pass on to other Amiga nuts. It is www.geocities.com/Vienna/6344/time100.htm This is a site from Istanbul Turkey and only this page is in English. Time  magazine  is  conducting  a  Poll  which  will come out next March called: 'Time100 : Who defines the 20th  century'  and  a  section  called  'BUILDERS  AND TITANS'. We in the Amiga community should pop over there and add a vote for the Father of the Amiga - Jay Miner. Please note that IBrowse and Aweb will NOT pull up the full voting screen. I have been told that Aweb III will,  but  can  not  verify  that.  BUMMER! [Editor's  Note: Voyager works just fine for this. You can get the demo version off the BBS.] Please  pass  this  along  and  if  you  feel  like  it  pop over to The Mission at www.cris.com/~jws/TheMission (my site dedicated to The Padre). Have fun…Jerry Smith …Bill Raecke
