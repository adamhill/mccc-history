## The Printed Page

A Look at Print Drivers and Printers

In last month's newsletter I mentioned a product I am now using to print this newsletter called Studio II and I  promised a review as soon as I became more familiar with  it.  I  followed  that  up  with  a  rather  disasterous meeting at Amiga-By-The-Loop where we weren't even able to get the product installed properly to demo it on all the printers we had available. I don't think this is going to qualify as a full review, but I have spent quite a bit of time with  both Studio  II and  its  competitor, TurboPrint. I've discovered quite a bit about them both. The TurboPrint that I have used for this review is the demo version 5 that is available on the BBS. It's partially disabled in that it will only print on one side of the page and its text handling is somewhat disabled, but otherwise is fully functional. The Studio II that I'm using is version 2.14, which is the latest version available, last updated in the  latter  part  of  January.  Both  products  offer  similar features.  Both  offer  standard  print  drivers  that  become part  of  your  system.  Likewise,  both  offer  a  stand-alone print utility so that you can print a picture directly from disk  without  using  any  other  software. Studio  II also provides a special PageStream 3.x driver. Let's  talk  about  those  external  utilities.  Without question, TurboPrint has  the  superior  interface.  First,  it actually shows the  picture  that  you  are  going  to  print. Studio II only shows the outline of the picture. This isn't a big disadvantage, of course, but seeing the picture is just nicer.  Also, TurboPrint gives  a  clearer  idea  of  your  picture's position on the soon-to-be-printed page. TurboPrint shows the full page size and then colors the margins of the  page  that  your  printer  can't  print  on.  Using  this layout, you can tell exactly where your picture will wind up on the printed page. Studio II , by contrast, shows only the  printable  area  of  the  page.  Since  the  unprintable margins are not equal on all four sides of the page, it is difficult to tell where your picture will actually be positioned on the page. Drag out the calculator! In addition, the  registered  version  of TurboPrint has  support  for outline fonts and allows you to add text to your printouts -  for  example,  to  add  captions. Studio  II does  not provide any text support at all. In short, TurboPrint wins hands down in a comparison of interfaces.

But  this  isn't  just  a  comparison  of  interfaces.  The thing that counts most of all with a print driver or print utility  is  the  quality  of  the  printed  output.  That's  what your money ($85 for either product) is being spent for, after  all.  When output becomes the measure of quality, moves into clear first place. Of course, I have to qualify  this  statement  by  pointing  out  that  I  have  only tested the products using my printer: a new HP DeskJet 693C.  Other  printers  may  produce  varying  results.  I should also point out that either product produces output that is far superior to the output that can be achieved with

Studio II standard drivers or with standard PageStream 3.2 drivers. Since the 693C is a color printer, I was interested in seeing  which  driver  produced  the  most  accurate  color. Using  the  default  dither  settings,  the TurboPrint output was far too warm and the Studio II output was somewhat too  cool.  The  default Studio  II dither  pattern  also muddied  the  picture  somewhat.  I  tried  both  products using the Floyd-Steinberg dither pattern. With this pattern, TurboPrint color was still far too warm while Studio II was almost perfect. Both products allow you to adjust color settings so that's something that can be overcome. What disturbed  me  more  was  the  banding  that  appeared  in TurboPrint output. I was unable to find a TurboPrint dither pattern  that  did  not  produce  an  unacceptable  banding. Studio II does not produce any noticable banding using almost  any  dither  pattern.  The  Floyd-Steinberg  pattern that I use for color output is perfect. The 256 grey-scale halftone that I use for black and white output is likewise free  of  banding  and  superior  to  what TurboPrint seems capable  of  producing.  Note:  At  the  ABL  meeting,  I mentioned that Studio II could not print using my printer's  maximum color resolution of 600 x 300 dpi. Not true!  It  can  be  accessed  by  specifying  'Presentation' quality. Another interface shortcoming. One more thought… Printing a color picture on my printer  takes  about  12  minutes  with  either  product.  I wondered if the printer or my computer was the hold-up. By 'printing' to disk and then copying that file to par:, I discovered  that  my  computer  took  1.5  minutes.  The printer takes the other 10 minutes or so. Moral: buy as fast a printer as you can. The HP DeskJet 870 should be about twice as fast as the 693.
