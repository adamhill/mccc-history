## The Amiga 5050T

## A Look At The New Amiga And The Siamese System That Will Drive It by Bill Raecke

A mid all the talk of new Amigas and new operating systems that will be released that will be compatible with the Amiga operating system, there is another product soon to be released by QuikPak. It's the Amiga 5050T. Rather than being a whole new product, the Amiga 5050T represents a logical extension of existing products. The 5050T will consist of an Amiga 4000T and a Pentium based  Windows  machine  coexisting  in  a  single  box  and using a single keyboard, mouse, monitor and peripherals. What it means is that you no longer need to consider going over to the dark side just to keep your boss happy at work. It  will  be  possible  to  run  those  PC  (and  Mac,  via Shapeshifter) applications that you need to run and, at the same  time,  keep  on  using  the  more  cost-effective  Amiga applications  you're  already  familiar  with  on  the  more advanced Amiga OS. What's the system going to consist of?

Amiga Features 68060 50 Mhz 1.2 Gb HDD 18MB RAM High density FDD Zorro and Video slots SCSI Bus networking

PC Features Pentium processor ISA and PCI slots SCSI Bus networking

This isn't just smoke and mirrors - and it isn't just wishful thinking. Tying these distinctly different operating systems together is the job of another software/hardware system already available. The name of the product is The Siamese System. Have I gotten your attention yet? I thought I might. The  rest  of  this  article  will  be  devoted  to  the  Siamese system itself. It's certainly a product worth considering on its own merits, although the idea of a single box holding all that power is certainly appealing. For more information, check out www.antigravity.com or the site of the product's author:  www.users.dircon.co.uk/~pnolan.  All  this  in- formation was gathered from those sites and was written by the product author, Paul Nolan.

## Introduction

The idea behind the Siamese System is to transparently integrate a PC with an Amiga, and in so doing, give the Amiga access to some of the cool things modern day PCs can do (that the Amiga would do if it weren't for horrific mismanagement).  For  example,  modern,  cheap,  'multimedia'  PCs  have  many  features  found  only  in  highly expanded  big  box  Amiga's  (if  at  all),  such  as  24bit  high resolution  graphics  cards  (often  with  3d  acceleration), software/hardware mpeg players, 16bit sound playback and recording, and of course 'Industry Standard' software. So why not take advantage of the PC? The Siamese System does more than take advantage, it practically rapes the PC.

So what exactly is the Siamese System? It consists of a Server  running  on  each  machine,  with  software  modules you can choose to activate. The Amiga and PC communucate  via  a  serial  lead,  which  is  looped  through  the Electronic  Software  Controlled  Display  Switcher.  The switcher is an ISA card that slots into your PC, and allows you to flick between the Amiga and the PC's video output to all the PC/s drives via a

at the press of a hotkey, or the press of a button, or via an ARexx command… (you get the idea).

## So what does it do?

The most obvious thing it does is allow you to use one  keyboard,  one  mouse,  and  one  monitor,  to  control both computers (you choose whether you want to use the Amiga or PC mouse/keyboard, or you can continue to use both if you want). You flick between computers as easily as flicking between Amiga screens, using a hotkey 'left-amigac', or 'f12" on the PCs keyboard. An Amiga depth gadget also appears on your Windows StartBar Tray. Pressing that goes  to  the  Amiga,  and  you  can  also  use  the  included Amiga96  StartBar  program  to  put  a  button  on  your WorkBench to flick back to the PC.

But  that's  just  scratching  the  surface.  One  of  the software  modules  you  can  run  is  called  MountPC.  This mounts a pseudo disk on the Amiga, called PC:. Inside this disk are directories for each drive you have on the PC. For example, you could type 'ed pc:c/autoexec.bat'to edit your PC's autoexec file using an Amiga text editor. Or you could render your LightWave scene using your fast PentiumPro 200  (or  soon  your  533mhz  DEC  Alpha),  and  edit  the output  images  on  the  Amiga  (say  with  Photogenics  for example), or use them with the Toaster. Maybe you don't own a CD-ROM drive for your Amiga. Using MountPC you have access to ALL PC drives, including CD-ROMS and networked drives! We successfully installed LightWave Amiga from the PC internal 10x CD-ROM drive.

By default  MountPC uses whatever cable you have between  your  Amiga/PC  (usually  a  Serial  lead,  soon Parallel though) to transfer files. You can get 10 to 12kb per second  this  way.  However,  using  SCSI-Networking,  you

![Image](1997_04_artifacts/image_000002_cc71dad30471880c0a3ea9ea0ac3a3c37b4a20b61f55f200a8e0c2674ca1edac.png)

can acheive transfer rates of several megabytes per second. You have a SCSI controller in your PC, linked to a (shared) drive, which is linked to the SCSI controller in the Amiga. Now both computers can see the drive in the middle of the SCSI chain. So if you wanted to copy a 10meg file from the PC's C: drive to Work: on the Amiga, you would copy the file  from pc:c/ to Work: as normal, but this time the file wouldn't be sent via the Serial lead, but would be copied to the shared drive. Once on the shared drive, the Amiga can then see the file (this is thanks to CrossDOS6 Pro, included with the Siamese pack), and so copies it to its final destination,  Work:. It may sound long winded, but you achieve speeds up to 30 to 50% the speed of the shared drive, which will be many many times faster than going via serial. Using a  very  old,  1meg per second shared drive, I achieve rates that are faster than ethernet. Using a more modern drive, you can get up to 10 times that speed.

But  there's  more  to  the  Siamese  System  than  that. What  if  you  want  to  move  some  text  between  the  two computers? Normally you`d save the text clip to a floppy disk, put the floppy in the other computer, and load it into whatever program you are using. Yuk. With the Siamese Systems ShareClipBoard module, you just cut the text from one computer and paste it into the other. Do you have a printer? Well, let both computers use it with UsePCPrinter, which redirects print output on the Amiga to the PC. Does your Amiga1200 have no real time clock? Use GetTime to set  your  Amiga's  date  and  time  from  the  PC's  battery backed up clock.

For  the  slightly  more  advanced  user,  the  Siamese System  comes  with  2  Amiga  CLI  commands.  WinExe &lt;filename&gt;  launches  the  given  filename  as  if  you  had double clicked it on the Windows desktop (even if the file is on the Amiga). You can use this to launch Quake from the WorkBench, or start your PC paint program with a file on the Amiga's hard drive (or anywhere else for that matter). For ease of use, you can use the supplied Amiga96 StartBar to call winexe from a popup menu item.

The MCI command works in a similar way. MCI is the Windows Multimedia Control Interface. You can use it to display pictures, view movies, play 16bit wave files etc. You can even set up a 'View on PC' button in DOpus. Want to see what your rendered images look like in 24bit? No problem. Obviously the Siamese System also  has  an ARexx  Port  so  these  commands  can  be  used  in  ARexx scripts, and integrated with other software. Siamese RTG

Currently in Beta Testing is version 2 of the Siamese System - Siamese RTG. It's a sad fact that even cheap PC Graphics cards outperform even the best Amiga cards. So in true Siamese System fashion, why not take advantage of that? RTG lets you open up your Amiga screens on your Windows desktop, at high resolution, high colour, and no flicker (assuming your PC's graphic card and monitor can handle it).

But isn't sending all the graphics data via the serial port  really  slow?  Well,  depends.  If  you  are  blitting  huge images on screen with something like LightWave's animation preview, it's going to be slow. But for general use, i.e. things like the WorkBench, it feels as fast, if not faster, than using an Amiga graphics card. In 256 colours, it's certainly many times faster than the AGA chip set! Windows move instantly (in real time using readily available PD utilities), and gadgets are drawn at lightning speed. In fact, running at 115200 baud, Siamese RTG can draw lines 500 times faster than the Amiga's chipset! That even outperforms a graphics card. And there's more…

## Video Playback Acceleration

As  I  explained  earlier,  transferring  animations  over the serial port is slow. So why not transfer the animation using MountPC, then get the PC to use its CPU to decode the  animation,  and  get  the  PC's  graphics  card  to  do  the hard  work  of  displaying  each  frame  at  high  speed?  The result  is  an  animation  player  that  plays  animations  faster than the Amiga, but in an Amiga window!

## Real Time 3D Graphics with OpenGL™

Real time 3D is a big thing these days. It seems like a new 3d card comes out every week for the PC, each better than the other. But Amiga users shouldn't feel left out. The CyberVision643D is now shipping isnt it? (er, without 3d support it is). Siamese RTG today (15th Jan 97) proved the feasability of controlling OpenGL™ from the Amiga. Heck, my PC doesnt even have a 3D card in it, my Pentium100 was doing all the hard work.

## Future Versions

So what's next? Siamese RTG will be released soon. Its  launch  will  hopefully  coincide  with  the  release  of  a version  of  the  Siamese  System  that  can  make  use  of  the greater  bandwidth  of  the  parallel  port.  This  will  be  an awesome combination.

But what about after that? Well a very special Siamese System was present at the Toronto AmigaFest. That wasn't Windows95 the PC was running, it was WindowsNT4.0. And  that  wasn't  Intel  inside,  that  was  a  433mhz  DEC Alpha. And please stop bugging me for modem sharing, it's on my todo list, and will be done between the other things.

Everyone  knows  that  only  open  systems  can  truly succeed. Siamese System 1.5 was open ended on the Amiga side, now this is being extended to the PC side as well. The new system will  allow  developers  to  write  modules  that execute on the PC, but are controlled by the Amiga, and vice  versa.  For  instance,  you  could  have  a  speed  critical routine running native on whatever CPU your PC has (eg 200mhz  Pentium  or  500mhz  DEC  Alpha  AXP  for  example),  in  parallel  with  code  running  on  the  Amiga. UPDATE: This is now in the Alpha stage, I`m just finalising the API. AGM

## phase 5 News

The A\Box Operating System Strategy by phase 5 Digital Products n the current situation of the Amiga, one of the biggest questions asked by many users is 'What is the future of the Amiga OS?'

As within our A\BOX project we follow the goal to build  an  innovative  computer  system  which,  in  our opinion, can be a dignant successor of the Amiga, we are very much affected by this question, as the AmigaOS is an important  part  of  the  Amiga  Computer,  and  we  will  be asked to offer the next generation Amiga OS if we want to offer the next generation Amiga by many users.

I

Before  we  discuss  the  OS  question,  we  need  to reinforce that while we do believe that the AmigaOS is an important part of the Amiga, we don't believe that the OS is it all that makes the Amiga. Many opinions commenting to this issue in the public discussions - mostly from SW people - argued that way. As a matter of fact, there is a significantly  larger  number  of  persons  who  understand (more or less) the software issues than persons who understand the hardware, just as there are many more software designers - professionals, semiprofessionals and hobbyists - than hardware designers out there. It's understandable that  SW  designers  often  don't  want  to  deal  with  the hardware itself and prefer to develop hardware independent (how does that work?). However, as a matter of fact it is still (and will continue to be) the hardware on which every software is running on. Any software - OS or application -  can  always  only  reveal  as  much  performance  as  the hardware can offer, it actually can't make hardware faster. It is a myth created by software people - who sometimes obviously don't understand the hardware - that hardware would  make  no  difference  or  is  unrelevant.  Just  as  an example: If a grahics controller can display any image in the main memory at any position of the screen just by changing a pointer, this is always significantly faster than if the image  data  must  be  copied  into  the  right  place  of  the display memory, and will save much more resources than the  leanest  OS  may  do.  Software  developer  who  don't understand  this  -  especially  in  respect  of  the  A\BOX hardware concepts - obviously don't see how significant innovation in hardware can be.

With this being said, we want to take a look on the operation  system  issue.  It  is  obvious  that  an  operation system has a major influence on the appearance of a system in general. Today, an operating system must offer a multitude  of  advanced  features  combined  with  high-speed execution, while it should be safe and proven to provide a stable system. Of course, beside a fast response the user also expects  a  friendly  and  modern  interface,  with  all  the comfort that she/he needs to work effciently. Especially the Amiga  user  has  expectations  on  the  fast  and  flexible

![Image](1997_04_artifacts/image_000003_424a9bb613d00bdc1085a0e1d267285a64db46f95579f37f8bd2a938b20206fe.png)

multitasking. However, most of these expectations do not depend so much on HOW things are done within the OS as long as they are done in a way that provides powerful and efficient functionality.

Looking on these issue more deeply, we can - very roughly - define 3 levels of interest inside an OS: the OS core,  which  is  like  Amiga  Exec  providing  the  basic  OS functionality, the system service/device level and the highlevel/GUI-level functions. The OS core must provide the functionality which is expected today from a modern OS; the system service/device level includes all the functionalities  like  drivers  for  e.g.  SCSI,  networking, ISDN, I/O in general, the file system, audio and graphic device  drivers,  and  similar  stuff.  On  the  high-level/GUIlevel  most  of  the  appearance  (or  look-and-feel)  of  the system is defined. As a matter of fact, for most users and also many developers it is not of interest how the OS core and  the  device  level  work,  as  long  as  it  works  fast  and reliable; the look-and-feel is nearly completely defined by the  high-level  functionality,  which  mostly  consist  of replacable applications - such as e.g. the Workbench on the Amiga.

Under consideration of these aspects, and after a long time of evaluation and discussion about the possibilities and options  we  have  finally  decided  to  use  a  modern  UNIX kernel as  the  operating  system  core  for  the  A\BOX.  We believe that this is the best choice available, as this solution provides a most flexible, reliable and proven way to supply a  powerful  OS  with  an  Amiga  like,  but  updated  and enhanced look-and-feel. As a matter of fact, the Amiga Exec has always been quite similar to UNIX in some of it's basic functionalities, although it was missing some of it's major features like Memory Protection or Virtual Memory. On the other hand, in earlier UNIX kernels the support for e.g. shared libraries and reloadable devices was missing… what made  these  UNIX  versions  large,  resource-hungry  and sluggish - the reason why UNIX was considered to be the dinosaur of the operating systems quite often.

Merging the best of both worlds and using the latest software  development  techniques  like  object-oriented system add-ons will  lead  to  a  powerful  operating  system fullfilling all the requirements of future computing.

What  will  this  mean  for  the  A\BOX  and  for  its relation to the AMIGA? First of all, we will have a OS core with the following features:

- Fast preemptive Multitasking
- Full multiprocessing support
- Multiuser support with all necessary services
- Memory Protection, a feature that is demanded by most developers

- Virtual Memory support
-  Loadable  Devices,  a  extension  of  the  original  UNIX functionality
-  Shared  Libraries  which  make  the  OS  use  much  less resources and make it significantly faster

With  these  functionalities,  tested  and  prooven  by large  numbers  of  installations  worldwide,  and  some optimizing on the fast PowerPC CPU, the OS core will be a  very  efficient  and  extremely  fast  OS  core  that  provides similar  functionality  to  an  Amiga  Exec  and  important features beyond it.

Around  this  OS  core,  a  large  quantity  of  system service software will provided, which comes from the Unix world and is long time prooven, such as:

- SCSI drivers and Ethernet hardware drivers
- TCP/IP service and networking protocols
- ISDN drivers and services
- Graphics Device drivers
- Audio Device drivers
- All kind of I/O drivers for various purposes

On this level, once again it does not make a major difference  how  the  things  work.  The  implementation  of software on this level may or may not be similar to the implementation on the Amiga. For the user as well as for the SW developer it's simply important that a similar and reliable functionality is provided, and that's what this level will do. As far as drivers have to support new functionality of the A\BOX that hasn't been available on any hardware before,  the  functionality  of  these  drivers  will  have  to  be new and different also.

On the higher-level OS functionality, we work on a system design that is similar to the Amiga in respect of the ease of use, as well as the look-and-feel. Many of the highlevel  functionality  of  the  AmigaOS,  which  basically consists of application programs running on top of the OS core and the device level, can be implemeted in a modern and updated way. A device-oriented file system representation  will  be  available,  as  well  as  software  components similar  to  commodities,  datatypes  or  Rexx.  An  Amigasimilar CLI will also be provided. With a comprehensive set of utilities and functionalities, software development for this  OS  will  be  easy  and  comfortable.  Software  that  will run on PowerUp cards and support CyberGraphX V3 will be  running  on  this  OS  with  high  performance,  and  a Virtual  Amiga  Machine  will  be  able  to  execute  even original Amiga 68k binaries fast and safely embedded into the system.

The A\BOX will come with a preinstalled system and a lot of tools that will make it as easy to use as the Amiga today. There won't be the need, for example, to recompile or link the OS kernel and it's drivers/devices in order to install  updates  or  changes;  also  it  won't  be  necessary  to spend major efforts configuring the system. Of course, the user is free to reconfigure the system to his likes, or go into the depths of the OS.

During late summer 1997, we plan to start alpha and beta releases of the A\BOX OS for developers running on our PowerUp accelerators. With this solution, developers can start to prepare their existing software for the A\BOX. The A\BOX alpha and beta OS release will be available for a small fee for the CD and possible documentation cost to all developers; free update support will be available via our FTP site.

We also will  release  hardware  functionalities  of  the A\BOX  custom  chip  CAIPIRINHA  as  a  spin-off  on  a graphic card add-on for the CYBERSTORM PPC later this year (unfortunately not for free); this graphic card will have a  stand-alone  version  of  our  DLRP  Display  List  Risc Processor  which  can  read  random  image  data  from  the main memory via DMA and write it to a WRAM-based frame buffer. With this board and the supporting driver, developers  can  start  to  experiment  with  the  superior functionality  of  this  design,  although  performance  is limited compared to the original A\BOX design (but will be, however, VERY competitive to existing graphics cards from the PC market).

Why didn't  we  commit  to  pOS  from  ProDAD? After  the  massive  marketing  campaign  by  ProDAD  for their upcoming pOS, many users have asked us to use their pOS  as  the  A\BOX  operating  system,  and  some  have critizized in harsh words that we are not planning to do it. As a matter of fact, we have yet not seen pOS running on 68k machines except at a presentation at Amiga 96, and we haven't seen it running at all on a PowerPC machine. An operating  system,  however  cannot  be  evaluated  from looking  on  a  nicely  designed  GUI;  it  must  be  evaluated running  completely  independent  from  any  proprietary features or OS code of the Amiga itself, showing multitasking and multiprocessor support, as well as all the necessary support  for  graphics,  sound,  drivers  for  SCSI,  ethernet, ISDN, other devices and anything else that counts.

We have spent a lot of money and efforts (and will spend even more) into our current developments, and we need to make sure that we have a working OS solution that fullfills  all  the  demands  of  future  computing.  As  we  had announced earlier, we do have a fully AmigaOS 3.1 Exec running,  and  had  other  OS-compatible  functionalities under development. However, a next generation OS needs significant enhancements, so we can't see that an OS which is  extremely  close  to  the  AmigaOS  3.x  can  fullfill  the demands. That's also valid for pOS; therefore we won't use or support pOS unless we can be convinced that it is a true, working and complete alternative.  It  must  also  be  taken into  consideration  that  other  companies  -  like,  for  example,  Be  -  needed  many  years  of  work  and  lots  of manpower and money to build a complete OS - and some even  say  that  BeOS  is  not  so  complete  yet,  at  least  in respect of system services and applications, tools and driver support -  which leads us to doubt whether pOS can be Continued on page 7

## Zip Drive Usage

Mountlists and Rigid Disk Blocks Compared by Dean Adams, GEnie (dean.a@genie.com)

H ard drives such as the ZIP drive can be accessed from the Amiga in two ways:  1) Format it and treat it as a regular hard drive, including using the RDB  (Rigid  Disk  Block)  parameters,  or  2)  create  a mountlist file and mount it that way. This article by Dean Adams  discusses  the  benefits  of  taking  the  mountlist approach. …Editor.

RE: Using a Mountlist or DEVS:DOSDrivers file for Zip disks. It's pretty straightforward, but the problem is it's a lot easier to begin with this method than it is to change after you have already written RDBs to some of your Zip disks. Changing means starting over with all of your Zip disks. The only way to remove any trace of the RDB is to do a low-level format. If the RDB is still present, you run the risk of corrupting some disks, unless the RDB parameters are the same as the Mountlist or DOSDrivers file.

The proper mountlist parameters are shown below, (but these are not the only ones which will work):

ZIP:

```
Device = omniscsi.device Unit = 5 Flags = 0x0 Surfaces = 2 BlockSize = 512 BlocksPerTrack = 34 Reserved = 2 Interleave = 0 LowCyl = 0 HighCyl = 2889 PreAlloc = 0 Buffers = 20 BufMemType = 5 DOSType = 0x444f5301 MaxTransfer = 130560 Mask = 0xffffffff Mount = 1 BootPri = -128 #
```

Edit  'Device'  in  accordance  with  the  SCSI  device name used on your system (scsi.device, etc.). Edit 'Unit' in accordance with the position of the 'SCSI ID' switch on the back of the Zip drive (5 or 6). Edit 'Mask' in accordance with the setting presently used with the hard drives already installed on the system.

Add  the  above  to  DEVS:Mountlist,  or  save  it  as DEVS:Mountlist,  if  there  isn't  a  Mountlist  in  DEVS: already. Or, save it as DEVS:DOSDrivers/ZIP (without the 'ZIP:' at the beginning and the '#' at the end). If it is saved as DEVS:DOSDrivers/ZIP, adding a project icon for the file is optional. Set the default tool to Mount.

I f a Mountlist i s used rather t h a n a DEVS:DOSDrivers file, then the command 'Mount &gt;NIL: ZIP:'  must  be  added  to  the  S:user-startup.  You  are,  of course, free to use a device name other than 'ZIP'.

During  bootup,  most  controllers  will  encounter  a delay when they find a SCSI device that does not contain a disk. They sort of sit there, waiting for you to insert one. If  you  also  have  a  CD-ROM  drive,  then  you  are  out  of luck. An empty CD-ROM drive is going to cause a delay anyway, so the best bet is to place a disk in both the CDROM drive  and  the  Zip  drive  in  order  to  avoid  delay. Otherwise, read on.

This problem may be avoided by using RDPrep [by MicroBotics]  to  set  the  HiDrive  flag  in  the  Rigid  Disk Block of the hard drive that has the highest SCSI ID. This will work so long as none of the hard drives have a SCSI ID = 6. In other words, so long as the Zip's SCSI ID is higher than that for any hard drive. Start RDPrep and select the hard  drive  with  the  highest  SCSI  ID.  Select  the  'Read RDB' gadget. You should get a notice 'Rigid Disk Block read  successfully'.  Select  'Go  to  Complex  Mode.'  If  the 'HiDrive'  setting  is  not  set  to  'Yes'  then  click  on  the gadget. Then click on the 'Write RDB' gadget.

NOTE: Only the hard drive with the highest SCSI ID should have its HiDrive flag set to yes. The HiDrive setting tells the SCSI host to not bother with scanning the buss for more eligible devices during bootup.

While you have RDPrep running, you should take the opportunity to check the Reselect setting for each hard drive. Always select the 'Read RDB' gadget after selecting a hard drive. If Reselect is set to 'Yes', change it to 'No' and save (write) the RDB. If Reselect is ON (Yes) for any drive, it will most likely lead to problems with a Zip drive.

[CUCUG  Editor's  Note:  Here's  what  one  of RDPrep's  Help  Screen's  says  about  Reselection:  A  SCSI option of use only when more than one computer is tied into  the  same  SCSI  bus.  When  your  computer  sends  a command to a drive (eg: Read a block), the drive normally ties  up  the  SCSI  bus  until  that  command  is  completed. When Reselection is enabled, the drive may tell the Host Adaptor to wait and then get off the SCSI bus; freeing it up so  a  second  Host  Adaptor  could  talk  to  another  device. When  the  drive  is  ready,  it  re-selects  the  original  Host Adaptor and finishes the command. We recommend you leave Reselection OFF as the extra operations needed to get off the bus and then back on again will slow down your system access time. ]

If you already have some Zip disks with a RDB, the RDB should be removed. This can be done only with a low-level format, so be sure that anything important on the

disk is already saved elsewhere. RDPrep can't do a low-level format, so you'll need HDToolBox for this step.

Start HDToolBox and select the proper SCSI ID and unit number (usually 0). If you can't find the Zip disk on the device list, then it probably doesn't have a RDB. Click on  the  Low-level  Format  gadget.  When  the  low-level format  is  complete, do  not,  under  any  circumstances , select 'Save Changes to Drive.' If you do, you will write another RDB to the disk. Now, you can re-boot or open a shell and type 'Mount ZIP:' (without the quotes). If you had any Zip disks with RDBs written to them, then, you should definitely reboot. Insert a Zip disk which does not have an RDB on it. Format it with the AmigaDOS Format utility (SYS:System/Format) and you are done. Adding or changing Zip disks is now as simple as buying a new floppy disk. No RDBs or HDToolBox, RDPrep, ExpertPrep, etc. Just pop the new disk in the drive and format it.

Why go this route? There are many advantages. You are guaranteed compatibility when transporting Zip disks from one Amiga to another. All you need is the Mountlist or  DEVS:DOSDrivers  file  normally  used  with  the  disk. While there is a limited degree of compatibility between different controllers, the success rate falls short of terrific. This is complicated by the fact that everyone's RDBs are likely to have different parameters, even if they are compatible.  And,  if  the  parameters  are  different,  you  can  say goodbye to any data on the disk if you make any attempt to write to the disk without taking proper precautions.

Here's the problem. John takes his Zip disk over to Jane's Amiga. They both use RDBs on their Zip disks and they both use the device name 'ZIP.' But they use different parameters (BlocksPerTrack, DOSType, etc.). The OS only reads the RDB ONCE for any given device. This is why some people have noticed that they don't need to write a Rigid Disk Block to every disk. Only the first disk to be inserted requires a Rigid Disk Block.

So, Jane inserts one of her Zip disks and it works fine. Then she removes it and inserts one of John's Zip disks. The system reads the RDB and says 'ah, this is just another ZIP:  disk  and  I  already  have  those  parameters.'  But  the parameters AREN'T the same. The OS is only fooled into thinking they are. And when an attempt is made to write something to any of John's disks, adios data. ALL the data.

The solution? John brings a copy of his Mountlist or DEVS:DOSDrivers/ZIP file with him on a floppy. When he wants to use one of his disks, he opens a shell and types 'Assign ZIP: dismount' followed by 'Mount ZIP: FROM (John's DOSDrivers/ZIP file).' Reverse the process to use Jane's  disks  again.  If  they  both  use  Mountlists  or DOSDrivers  files  with  the  same  parameters  then  it's completely transparent and there's nothing to worry about. The  following  parameters  MUST  be  the  same:  Flags, Surfaces, BlockSize, BlocksPerTrack, Reserved, Interleave, LowCyl,  HighCyl,  PreAlloc  and  DOSType.  Obviously, parameters like Device and Unit will vary with the system.

The bottom line is that it makes a lot more sense to store  data  of  this  nature  in  one  central  location  than  to place it on every disk. Rigid Disk Blocks were never meant to be used on removable media. Can you imagine what a pain it would be if everyone used the equivalent of a Rigid Disk  Block  on  all  their  floppies?  The  variety  of  RDBs would be a nightmare.

[Editor's Note: I thought this was an interesting article because  it  raises  a  lot  of  questions.  But I  couldn't  disagree more  with  the  solution! Look  at  the  statement  above  that states  that  Flags,  Surfaces,  Blocksize,  BlocksPerTrack,  etc. MUST be the same. Is that likely? And it is further complicated by the fact that the hard drive controller and device number will  almost  certainly  be  different.  That  means  that  your mountlist has to be modified when you get it to your friend's house. It's obviously NOT the simple solution that the author indicates.

A MUCH better solution is to keep a Rigid Disk Block on each disk. Then you can overcome ALL the problems with a simple  program  you  can  get  from  the  MCCC  library  called 'SCSIMounter.' Every time you put another disk in the drive, you  simply  fire  up  'SCSIMounter'  and  re-mount  your  ZIP drive. The system then reads the information from the RDB of the disk that is in the drive and everything will work correctly. All old information is flushed from memory. It won't matter at all if the drives have been formatted the same and you won't have to worry at all about different controllers, device numbers and the like. Attach 'SCSIMounter' to a ToolManager Dock or a Tools Daemon menu and the whole operation becomes totally painless - without resorting to a shell at all…Bill Raecke] AGM

## A\Box OS - from page 5

completed,  updated,  expanded  and  maintained  in  a  way that would be expected from it.

We  are  not,  as  some  assumed,  going  to  prevent ProDAD from porting pOS to any of our hardware; we simply won't support it - especially in its alpha state but offer and support our own solutions. We can't commit to pOS as the OS solution for our PowerUp accelerators as ProDAD wanted us to do - and later consequently for the A\BOX. What would automatically happen once we commit to pOS on the PowerUp boards and leave software developers  only  this  choice;  this  would  mean  that  the success  of  our  hardware  project  A\BOX  would  fully depend on external software/OS work by a third party - a scenario very benefical to pOS, but very difficult for us in case pOS cannot meet the expectations it has created.

If, in the future, pOS is fully operational, provides all functionality of a modern OS, gets sufficient support from software developers, and can be ported to the A\BOX in a way  that  it  can  make  use  of  its  advanced  hardware,  we would probably welcome pOS as an alternative OS. AGM

The Best of The BBS - On Disk by Bill Raecke

M CCC-A\_1228 CLICon:  It's  a  replacement  for  the  IconX command that comes with the AmigaOS. IconX, for  those  who  aren't  familiar  with  it,  is  a  program  that executes a script from an icon. CLICon is better because it allows you to embed the script that needs to be run into the icon itself. This means there's one less file to keep up with on disk. IconJ did the same thing back in 1990, of course and it still works just fine - but if this is a new concept to you, check this out. It can make your life easier.

CyberUpdate2.22:  Just  one  of  three  updates  this month to the CyberGraphX software package. All three updates are included because the updates don't all modify the  same  programs.  You  need  to  get  all  the  updates  and install  them  in  sequence.  CyberGraphX,  for  those  who may not know, is THE software package to use with any graphics card. It supports CyberGraphX, Retina, Picasso, and all the other major players. It has become the standard. No matter which graphics card you wind up purchasing, save another few dollars for the CyberGraphX package.

Useless\_mwb\_4:  I  guess  it  may  be  useless,  but  I thought enough of it to add it to the month's collection. It's a collection of brushes done in Magic Workbench colors designed  to  be  used  as  Workbench,  Screen  or  Windows backgrounds on your Workbench. It's a very nice collection.

## MCCC-A\_1230

ToolManager:  ToolManager  is  one  of  those  utilities that simply everyone ought to be running. It adds items to your  Workbench  TOOLS  menu  and  gives  you  the capability  to  add  AppIcons,  docks  and  sounds  to  your Workbench.  All  this  really  ought  to  be  built  into  the system,  of  course,  but  in  the  meantime  you  can  do  it yourself with this package. ToolManager has been around for  a  number of years. This is release 3.0. There is some debate as to whether this version is better than previous versions… some things have been added - others have been removed. One thing that is a definite improvement is the new  MUI-based  configuration  program.  Anyway,  if  you don't have ToolManager installed on your system, time to get with it. If you do have it, check out the upgrade.

MiamiSpeedMeter: It's pretty much what the name implies. Run this program and it will give to an up-to-thesecond account of the transfer rates that Miami is handling, both incoming and outgoing. (Miami, of course is the way you should be hooking your computer up to the internet. Look for the upgrade elsewhere in this month's disks.)

NewZIPMount:  Just  a  collection  of  mountlists  for ZIP drives. Gives you access to cartridges formatted for the

![Image](1997_04_artifacts/image_000004_7c93d25e385905468953fdf171a1a78f944ceb1c8381f0e7c24415fd90a8343d.png)

PC or the MAC.

MCCC-A\_1230

MUI\_3.8: Simply the latest version of MUI. Provides new capabilities  that  IBrowse  and  other  MUI-based  programs  are  already  taking  advantage  of.  Time  to  get upgraded. It's  distributed  here  in  archived  format  due  to floppy space limitations.

## MCCC-A\_1231

IBrowse\_1.1: I've tested all the web browsers. To my mind, there is no question - IBrowse is the best. This is the 1.1 update that, among other improvements, provides the first support for frames on the Amiga platform. This is not a demo version. It is an update for registered owners of the product. If you don't already own IBrowse, this disk won't help you. If you do own IBrowse, you definitely need this update. Two versions are provided in archived format - one for 68000-based Amigas, and one for 68020 or greater.

MCC\_HTMLtext:  MCC  stands  for  MUI  Custom Class.  This  provides  HTML  capability  for  MUI-based programs.  A  simple  HTML  reader  is  provided  with  the custom class. That means that you no longer have to fire up your browser to read a simple HTML text document that you have on disk.

MCCC-A\_1232

MCC\_MonthNavigator: It's a MUI Custom Class to handle  calendar  functions.  A  simple  calendar  program  is included in the distribution. It's wise to stay current.

New8n1:  This  is  a  replacement  for  the  standard Amiga  serial.device.  It's  lots  faster.  It  will  allow  you  to transfer at higher rates using the standard serial port than you could with the standard device driver AND it will put less of a strain on your system, allowing you to do more multitasking while you are downloading or uploading. If you are using the standard serial port, get this one for sure.

MCCC-A\_1233

CyberShow: CyberShow is simply the best  picture viewing  utility  for  CyberGraphX  systems.  It  also  works well on plain AGA Amigas. It will handle the major file formats internally and will use datatypes for anything else. It's fast and it provides lots of options, including slideshow capabilities with fancy wipes. This is version 8.2a. To see your pictures in color, you have to be a registered user. If you're not registered, you just get to see your pics in greyscale. It's a program well worth the registration cost.

term\_4.7c: term is the best terminal program available for the Amiga. This is a patch to take you from version 4.7

to version 4.7c. Just bug-fixes, but it probably pays to keep up to date, even if you have never seen any bugs (I haven't).

## MCCC-A\_1234

ChaosPro\_2.13: ChaosPro is the best fractal exploration program I have found for the Amiga. The interface is clear and easy to use and you can have multiple windows actively drawing concurrently. All the fractal formats are provided for including Mandelbrot, Julia and Lyaponov. It will even save pics in 24-bit format, which gives unbelievable  results.  Check  this  one  out.  It's  distributed  here  in archived format because of floppy space limitations.

ScreenClock:  This  is  the  latest  version  of  a  little utility  I've  been  using  for  some  time  now.  It  provides  a clock and, optionally, free memory information in the title bar of the active screen. (It's also supposed to optionally provide  information  on  CPU  utilization,  but  I've  never managed  to  get  this  working.)  The  information  travels from screen to screen with you so you're never without the information you need.

## MCCC-A\_1235

FastIPrefs4035:  It's  a  replacement  for  the  standard Amiga IPrefs program. This is a must for anyone running a CyberGraphX system. It provides some improvement for a standard WB 3.x setup as well. It allows me, for example, to display a 256-color picture as my Workbench background on a 32,768 color screen without messing with the picture's palette  as  the  standard  IPrefs  does.  On  a  standard  (no graphics board) Amiga, FastIPrefs saves memory (and it's faster).

sun.datatype: A 3.x datatype to handle the display of graphics from a Sun Workstation.

mpegvideo\_datatype:  It  allows  you  to  view  MPEG animations using Multiview.

targa.datatype: Allows you to view pics in the Targa format using Multiview or any other datatype aware utility.

TM30\_PopMCCs:  An  upgrade  to  the  Pop  MUI Custom  Class.  This  update  is  specifically  to  provide support for ToolManager 3.0.

## MCCC-A\_1236

MCC\_TimeString:  Another  one  of  those  MUI Custom Classes that you need to keep current on.

Soliton: It's been a while since a nice Solitaire game came around. This one is particularly nice to use because it's been programmed with MUI providing the interface. It works well and looks good - and it's a good way to kill some time. The only thing I miss is the ability to save game statistics and high scores.

## MCCC-A\_1237

CyberUpdate2.23: This is another of those CyberGraphX software updates that I mentioned earlier. You need to get all three to keep your software current.

JPEG-Pics:  If  you  like  animal  pictures,  here  are  a couple  of  pics  worth  adding  to  your  collection.  There's picture of a doe and fawn, and another picture of a baby harp seal. Check 'em out.

VersionWB: This program provides version information on the software in your system. It can be operated as any standard Intuition based program. If you don't provide the  name  of  a  program  or  library  to  be  checked,  a  file requester is opened to prompt you. It can also be operated from a shell where the name of the file is provided on the command line. This makes it very nice for building into a directory  utility  such  as  Directory  Opus.  It's  output  in either case is provided in a nice Intuition window.

## MCCC-A\_1238

HBMonopoly:  I'm  not  a  big  fan  of  the  game Monopoly, but this is such a nice implementation that I had to  include  it  here.  The  game  board  opens  on  the Workbench. You can have up to four players, and any of them can be either human or computer players. You can play solo against three computer opponents if you like. If you're  looking  for  a  change  from  Solitaire,  this  may  be right up your alley.

CyberUpdate2.24: This is the last of the CyberGraphX software updates that I've been mentioning. Be sure to get them all.

## MCCC-A\_1239

akJFIF-Datatype: Time to upgrade the more important datatypes. This one is a JPEG datatype. It supports all screen resolutions, including 24-bit. On my system it's so fast that JPEG pictures come up almost as fast as IFFs. A huge improvement over the standard JPEG datatype that came with the system.

akPNG-Datatype:  PNG  pictures  aren't  all  that common so far as I am aware, although you never know when  you  might  encounter  one  while  browsing  the Internet.  This  datatype  will  prepare  you  for  that  eventuality. Like the JPEG datatype, this one is fast.

## MCCC-A\_1240

akSVG-Datype: This datatype handles pictures in the SuperView  format.  Once  more,  it  doesn't  hurt  to  be prepared.

Miami\_1.20j:  This  is  a  complete  distribution  of Miami. Miami is the best way to hook up to the internet. It's fast, inexpensive, and easy to use. If you're registered, install  this  and  you'll  be  set  to  go.  Without  registering, your sessions will be limited to one hour, although you can reconnect immediately after losing your connection.

WizardLibrary: It's just another of those libraries that programs keep wanting you to install. This one is required by the Prefs programs supporting the 'ak...' datatypes. Get it. Install it. AGM

## February and March Meeting Notes Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

February turned out to be a strange month in many ways. It is usually known as a dry month with plenty of grass fires. This year we get record rain, not exactly what we need just before the usual heavy rains hit. Our meeting for the second month of the year had a similar reversal of fortunes. We usually have trouble coming up with something, for the meetings, 'till the last minute. Fortunately, it seems  things  come  together  with  an  interesting  meeting that works. Not this time.

We got our thoughts  together  and  came  up  with  a rather exciting meeting, in advance. We decided to demo a good  cross  section  of  printers  representing  the  most popular type, inkjets. It  was  agreed  that  this  would  be  a great  presentation,  and  to  make  it  better  the  latest  in printer driver technology for the Amiga would be used to make  the  printers  perform!  This  was  going  to  be  a memorable meeting for sure.  Then  it  came  time  for  the meeting. Things started out well enough… the most people I have seen at a meeting outside the Christmas meeting. All the  printers  showed  up  well  enough,  but  where  was  the computer? An unforeseen delay had occurred, keeping its owner away a little longer than desired, but he did arrive. That was a relief - 'till the next step. Installing the software began to look like a problem. Indeed it turned out to be almost impossible. We did get one printer to print with the software. Two of the other printers were coaxed into printing using built in demo modes, which gave us no real comparison. One thing for sure - we will try this again.

March, if you have not noticed, mirrors February, as far as the calendar looks. If February has 28 days, then the 28 days of March will be on the same day of the week as the  February  day.  We  hold  our  meetings  on  the  second Tuesday, and it fell on the 11th for both of these months. To make them even more similar we had come up with a plan ahead of time. It was even a similar idea. We planned to test a group of printers in February, now we planned to test  a  group  of  removable  media  drives  for  March. Removable media has really taken off in a big way lately. The success of the ZIP drive has really shown that people are in need of a large capacity drive that offers the ability of a disk drive, to move data around or offer unlimited storage for a single drive. The meeting started out even better than last  month,  with  everything  showing  up  on  time!  Setup went well with everything we needed being available. Our first plan was to hook up all the drives together in a chain and proceed. SCSI is supposed to do this really well as long as you follow the rules. As we were about to discover the rules  had  abandoned  us.  After  repeated  tries  to  get  our setup to work, we had to change our plans. We decided to run the drives one at a time. Even this had problems. One drive wanted to be terminated, as it should be, being at the end  of  a  chain.  The  next  drive  refused  to  work  when terminated. The final drive refused to work at the end of the chain at all.

At least  we  got  to  test  all  of  the  drives!  Our  three drives included the ZIP, JAZ, and Olympus SYS.230. The ZIP drive, the most popular on the market, represents a natural  extension  of  floppy  technology.  It  has  100MB capacity  per  disk.  The  JAZ  drive  features  hard  drive technology in a removable format. It has 1GB on each disk, or 1000MB. The SYS.230 uses magneto-optical technology that  Olympus hopes can take some of ZIP's market. We had another minor problem - some of the tests I brought needed Magic User Interface, and the machine we used did not have it. So we were limited to two tests. SysInfo's less than  perfect  test,  and  a  test  where  we  copied  the  font directory from RAM to the test drive. SysInfo showed the ZIP drive and SYS.230 at about the same speed, 950K per second. The JAZ drive gave over 2MB in that test, as fast as the hard drive attached to the system, which is probably about as fast as that particular controller can go. Copying the directory was very revealing. The ZIP and JAZ drive either tied or came in within a second or so of each other. The SYS.230 is nearly twice as slow, or more. This was a shock to me since I own it. Olympus advertises it as twice as fast, and PC World had shown it to be just that in their test. Our March meeting was fun and informative. Now if we can repeat it! We will be planning our meeting on April 1st. I hope that doesn't mean something…
