## Petro Speaks

## Petro Tyschtschenko's Speech at the Midwest Amiga Exposition What's the latest from Amiga?

T he  following  speech  was  delivered  by  Petro Tyschtschenko on Saturday, November 1, 1997, on the show floor of the Midwest Amiga Exposition in Columbus, Ohio. Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Amigans, I'm  very  pleased  to  attend  the  Amicon  which  is indeed  my  first  big  convention  after  Gateway  2000  Inc. acquired Amiga. This  year,  on  May  31,  I  was  invited  by  the  Amiga Atlanta User Group. Out of this potential User Group, I met people who are attending the Amicon today. Thank you very  much  for  this  invitation  and  for  your  time  to listen to me. As  you  know,  yesterday  was  Halloween  and  I  was very pleased that nobody beat me up, because I will not bring  any  'Sweets'  -  like  news  from  our  Research  &amp; Development department. As you noticed already, Mr. Jeff Schindler, the general Manager of our newly founded Research &amp; Development department, is  not  available  today.  At  the  moment  he  is preparing a strategy road map which will be announced at the Cologne fair. Today I do not intend to talk a lot about our history, because everybody knows what has happened, how exciting and how glamorous and sometimes how sad and negative our history was designed. You may remember my speech at the World of Amiga in  London  with  Dr.  Jim  Taylor,  world-wide  President Global Marketing of Gateway 2000, Inc. on 18th May 97. In  his  speech,  Dr.  Jim  Taylor  pointed  out  that  Gateway 2000 has not bought Amiga to make it smaller. Gateway 2000 want the Amiga to grow. And  indeed,  at  AMIGA  International,  Inc.  we registered already growth. We founded  AMIGA International Inc. in Langen which is under my direction. We are responsible for the Sales and Marketing world-wide. In  Germany  we  are  in  total  7  people.  We  are  very successful  in  selling  our  existing  products  world-wide. Besides  Europe,  we  have  tremendous  improvements regarding the sale in India and in Australia, but our North American business is also increasing. Good  news  are  that  we  will  have  for  our  A1200 Amiga Magic Pack, which was until now only available in PAL, an NTSC version for the North American market available beginning December 97. We also cut down our prices dramatically to build up the market for our future products and to find new clients - it's to convince by our fantastic Amiga technology. We  have  negotiated  with  Quikpak  about  a  license agreement, and it is already signed a few days ago. As  I  already  mentioned,  it  was  founded  a  new company - Amiga Inc. in South Dakota, close to Gateway 2000. Amiga Inc. is responsible for the Research and the Development of new Amiga products, as well as hard and software. The company is managed by Jeff Schindler. Currently in South Dakota at Amiga Inc. there are working 5 people:

· Jeff Schindler, General Manager · Darreck Lisle, Event coordinator · Marylin Flint, Operations manager · Joe Torre, Senior engineer

- Kelly Newby, Bookkeeper

Coming back  to  AMIGA  International  world-wide sales  and  Marketing  activities  out  of  Europe,  they  are  as follows:

· Supporting the existing Amiga community · Leveraging the existing Amiga technology through brought licensing

- Assisting in developing new products based on open standards to the home computer and video/graphics market.

Since March 97, I have visited and supported worldwide  Amiga  activities  to  keep  up  our  community.  In Europe I was attending the following conventions:

- Heilbronn/Germany, Amiga User Meeting with Keith Bradach from Gateway 2000
- Trier/Germany, Convention called 'Magic Days'
- Stockholm/Sweden, Amitech 97
- Hammersmith/England, World of Amiga
- Warsaw/Poland, Gambleriada 97 and Intel Outside Party
- Atlanta/USA, User Group convention
- Dakota Dunes/'USA, first constitutional meeting
- Saarbr·cken/Germany, User Group convention
- Hof/Germany, User Group convention
- Empoli/Italy, Pianeta Amiga
- Bombay/India, Scat 97
- Australia, Amiga Gathering
- And now here in Port Columbus at the Amicon.

AMIGA  International  has  reached  many  license agreements. They are:

- A1200

Micronik (Germany)

- A4000 - Nova Sector (USA)
- Amiga OS 3.1

Software Hut (USA)

Power Computing (UK)

Vesalia Computer (Germany)

- Software Application

Epic Marketing (UK) - Image 3.1 KS Rom

Cloanto (Italian), Amiga forever

- Merchandise Product (for example T-shirts)

Vidamus (Sweden)

Robert Hamilton (USA)

Triple A (France)

Logica (Italy)

Randomize (Canada)

Amiga Plus (Germany)

- For new hardware based on Amiga OS 3.1

Index (UK), Access

DCE GmbH, Germany

Quikpak (USA)

- Spare Part distribution

Paxtron (USA)

Further license contracts are in sight:

- For A1200 Elbox (Poland) Intrinsic (UK) Professional Support Service (South Africa)
- New hardware based on Amiga OS 3.1

REC (USA) China/Europe - Wonder TV

The next big convention is coming soon which will be the Cologne fair called 'Computer 97" starting 14th to 16th November 97.

For  years,  the  fair  was  called,  'The  World  of Commodore' and than after Commodore's bankruptcy it was changed into 'Computer with the current year'. It was the largest Amiga fair world-wide. In 1995 there were more than 60,000 people attending the show.

Last  year  when  Amiga  Technologies  was  under bankruptcy protection, there was no fair booth and I was sitting around like an refugee and I tried hard to represent Amiga  outgoing  from  foreign  booths.  This  situation affected also the figures of visitors. The figure dropped to only 35,000 in 3 days.

During the opening ceremony last year, I promised to be back in 1997 - and indeed I achieved this goal. AMIGA International will have a big fair booth with about 2,000 square  feet.  AMIGA  International  will  not  sell  any products  during  the  fair.  We  will  represent  the  Amiga technology and the licensed technology.

In our booth, following companies are exhibiting and demonstrating their products - powered by Amiga:

- HI Q Limited, UK
- Haage &amp; Partner, Germany
- Index Information, UK
- Micronik, Germany
- Herrn Holger Kruse, USA (Miami Internet Software)
- Angela Schmidt, Germany (CD burning)

The biggest enrichment is that we can show the new designed boards by DCE Computer Service GmbH. This board is based on the A4000 with following features: There will be 2 versions available

- A5000

CPU 68030/50 Mhz Up to 64 MB Ram Standard PC Keyboard 1.44 MB Floppy Disk 1.7 Gbyte IDE HDD 10 - 24 Speed IDE CD ROM

AGA Chipset

Scan Doubler - HF Modulator optional

- A6000

CPU 68060/50 Mhz Up to 128 MB RAM Standard PC Keyboard 1.44 MB Floppy Disk 1.7 Gbyte IDE HD 10 - 24 Speed IDE CD ROM

AGA Chipset

Scan Doubler - HF Modulator optional

I  think  this  product  will  be  very  successful  in  our near future. It will help us to keep the market alive and growing. For further information, please watch [http://www.dcecom.de/] http://www.dcecom.de/.

This  year  in  Cologne  we  expect  more  than  60,000 visitors,  80%  of  them  will  be  Amiga  fanatics.  In  well organized  workshops,  the  following  companies  will  be represented through News and Information.

- Phase 5 - workshop Power PC and strategy
- Cloanto-Amiga Forever, a hot discussion item
- Haage &amp; Partner- Internet &amp; Java, Compiling C code using Storm C, linking and creating executable
- Nova Design-Alladin 4D-an old friend is back,
- Cinemorph - faster and faster
- Image FX
- And Vulcan Software from England will present their new Genetic Demo.

Due  to  the  world-wide  shortage  of  Amiga  video monitors, AMIGA International will also demonstrate how to use a standard PC monitor with our beloved Amiga.

I think it is very important, that we explore an open Amiga  platform,  use  industry  standard  components  to reduce the production costs, to make it faster to develop and easier to upgrade. I will try to reach this goal in a very managed fashion. Highlights  of  the  Cologne  fair  will  be  the  long expected announcement about the Future of Amiga. Which will  be  stated  at  the  developer  conference  on  Friday evening at 7. This is the end of my speech and today I had the great pleasure again to stand here and to give my opinion: Amiga has a bright future ahead! Thank you for being here and many thanks to the people who organized this big and successful event. …Petro Tyschtschenko AGM

'DOS/WIN based computers manufactured by companies such as IBM, Compaq, Tandy, and millions of others, are by far the most popular, with about 70 million machines in use worldwide. Macintosh fans, on the other hand, note that cockroaches are far more numerous than humans, and that numbers alone do not denote a higher life form.' … New York Times

## Cologne

## First report from Computer '97 By Joachim Sondermann-Bieker

H i all! I was able to have a little chat with Petro Tyschtschenko  during  the  Computer  97  Amiga fair in Cologne. Here's what he said in brief:

- New Amigas shall be aggressively priced to broaden the user base, both in the home sector and the professional sector. T. gave a figure of 400 Mark (around $230) for an entry level Amiga to 1500 Mark (approx. $870) for the top machine. (Rem: I'm not sure how complete such a machine can be. T. remained vague about whether you would have to add some components to get a really decent Amiga, e.g. HD, Gfx board or so)
- New Amigas shall be developed by Amiga Inc., USA, but not necessarily manufactured by Amiga itself. Instead, Amiga International is supposed to licence new developed items to whoever. Under a 'powered by Amiga'    label there shall be a variety of manufacturers that actually build Amigas. Amiga Intl. will see that certain standards and compatibility are maintained.
- There is no decision yet which CPU shall be used in the new Amiga line. Tyschtschenko made a pretty surprising statement: He would like most a Motorola 68060 or 68080 at 200 MHz in a new Amiga. He pointed out the    advantage of being able to use a simple OS upgrade from 3.x instead of a complete rewrite. He didn't elaborate whether Motorola would be willing to build such a beast. Another option, processor-wise, would be some sort of cooperation with Phase5 (and the PPC board).

Besides, Tyschtschenko said pretty good things about the work with Gateway executives. Amiga sales were going up.  All  in  all  he  displayed  lots  of  optimism  though  he didn't disregard possible dangers. AI stated earlier that new Amigas were not to be expected before sometime late in 1998. Maybe OS 3.5 will be out in the middle of the year.

## NewTek Speaks

NewTek Affirms Its Commitment To The Amiga By Dwight Parscale, President and CEO, NewTek Partners, LP

N ovember 11, 1997 Dear Loyal NewTek Customer Well,  I  am  pleased  to  see  that  the  passion  for NewTek and our products is still strong. However, I do believe that a number of misconceptions are brewing. I'd like to take the time to address these issues to all of you so that you have a clear picture of where NewTek stands.

At NewTek Expo last month a statement was made during  the  dealer  meeting  on  Sunday  afternoon  that referred to NewTek's Amiga development being 'on hold.' NewTek  is  in  the  desktop  video  development  business.

Today, and for the last 10 years the Amiga has been the most suitable computer for this development. Now that the Amiga is in the hands of Gateway 2000 we are evaluating our next move. Gateway provides us with the potential to pursue a number of different avenues of development, some obvious, others less so. I am in conversation on virtually a daily  basis  with  the  folks  at  Gateway  working  on  an agreement. One of the first steps taken by Gateway is the licensing of QuikPak. We have encouraged this association and  are  please  to  see  that  a  dependable  supply  of  equipment,  parts  and  warranty  service  will  be  available  to  all

![Image](1997_12_artifacts/image_000004_ea955b4055d7e353a6df3d87f50c1f9e53c2a8e6f4a2ed5ac4860f951d5a9d87.png)

Amiga users.

As  for  our  commitment  to  you,  our customers, NewTek's mission has always been to provide  our  customers  with  the  most  powerful tools  possible  at  a  price  that  is  affordable.  This approach  has  resulted  in  a  significantly  large number of people being able to enter careers and make a living doing something they enjoy where it  may  not  have  been  possible  otherwise.  Since our  move  to  San  Antonio  we  have  committed substantial additional resources to improving our customer service. The Technical Support staff has doubled in size and over half of that team has a focus  on  nothing  but  Toaster  and  Flyer  issues. Additionally, we have numerous Amiga programmers on staff working on future developments.

One  of  the  other  business  components that  NewTek  has  committed  a  great  deal  of resources  to  is  third  party  development.  For many  customers  one  of  the  most  appealing aspects  of  the  NewTek  line  of  products  is  the wealth  of  support  from  third  party  developers that provides additional capabilities and depth of functionality to our products. We welcome and encourage this  support  and  expect  to  see  much more development from this arena on the Toaster and Flyer, in addition to LightWave.

We remain committed to Amiga technology and believe the future holds the potential for more  great  things.  We  have  never  stopped believing in or supporting the Amiga, our users, or  the  creative  talent  that  finds  ways  to  use  or improve our technology.

As  always,  we  appreciate  the  high  value that you place on NewTek and our products. It is absolutely  our  mission,  in  fact  our  passion,  to make  sure  that  you  have  the  most  powerful, exciting  tools  possible  and  still  at  a  price  that makes our competitors crazy. AGM

Microsoft is the Most Trusted Company? By Eric W. Schwartz, from the Amiga Gazette

O ne thing I've found interesting in the past month was a poll conducted by a television news program which asked people what companies they trusted. Extremely surprising (to me, anyway) was that Microsoft took the top spot in trust. All good Amiga owners (and most Mac owners) know that Bill Gates is effectively the Anti-Christ and Microsoft is his engine of world domination. Many knowledgeable PC owners I've talked to have difficulty with some or all of Microsoft's products, policies, or  business  tactics,  and  almost  certainly  would  not  be willing to lend Bill Gates twenty bucks to tide him over until  payday.  After  all,  not  all  of  those  anti-Bill  comedy texts were written by Mac, Amiga, and Unix users.

It  would seem that the majority of the folks in the poll are the ignorant consumer sap-types who buy Packard Bells at Best Buy and use the internet exclusively through AOL free offer disks. There's a sad truth in this: These are the people who think they've got the best stuff when they have  no  idea  what  the  other  options  are.  These  are  the people who believe what the biggest marketing budget tells them. Saddest of all, these are the people who will never buy an Amiga because they have no idea what it can do, and because it doesn't play Duke Nukem 3D (actually, it does,  if  you  want  to  be  technical  about  it).  We  are  way beyond  the  day  of  the  Commodore  64,  when  a  good computer  product  could  effectively  sell  itself,  and  the computer was a tool to do work, expand the mind, and have fun all at once - and that is the saddest thing of all.

No one has fun with their computers any more. As incorrect as that sounds, it's a true statement as far as I'm concerned. Think back to the dawn of the Amiga, when the C64s, Apple IIs, and Atari 800s ruled the world. Many computer  owners  did  a  variety  of  things  with  their machines,  often  dabbling  in  programming,  graphics  and sound, games, and work-related stuff all at once, and often inter-related.  The  Amiga was a marvel then, as it was so good at so many different things, and it attracted a lot of 'hackers' - the types who love to tinker with computers almost  purely  for  sheer  enjoyment  of  technology  (as opposed to those who create viruses and illegally tap into others'  computers).  Nowadays,  the  hackers  are  all  either gone or working in a cubicle somewhere, and the enjoyment of computers for their own sake is gone. People buy and use computers to do two things now: to make money and waste time. Making money is classified as using your own  computer  to  do  work  for  someone  else,  or  find information to benefit you one way or another. Wasting time can be best typified by cruising the Net and playing games.  While  this  is  fun  for  many,  there's  none  of  the creativity  that  was  involved  in  the  days  of  the  hackers.

That's the reason the Amiga may never achieved the same success  as  the  early  days:  so  few  people  are  concerned enough  with  their  computer  to  think  beyond  what  the advertisers  tell  them.  Ads  tell  them,  'You  need  Pentium! (bing  Bing  bing  BING)'  and  they  go  'Yes,  master.'  The users don't even know they have a choice, don't enjoy their computers, and just use them without realizing the fun they have  with  games  could  be  had  with  creatively  as  well. Notice  how  I've  come  pretty  much  full  circle  with  this commentary?

I'm like most folks, and I don't have the same kind of creative  enjoyment  with  my Amiga  that  used  to,  as  the real-life monster has forced me to keep working - but I like to  try  to  keep  a  little  of  my own  projects  and  creativity going, even in the work I do for others. Try not to lost that sensibility folks. It's  what brought you to the Amiga in the first place. AGM

## Power PC

## Sinking Ships

## By Carl Sassenrath, Author of Amiga's OS Kernal

S o, I see the PPC continues to screw things up. Intel and Microsoft must laugh all the way to the bank as the  PPC  continues  to  generally  erode  the  Motorola based  CPU  marketplace.  Have  any  companies  come  out ahead  on  this  venture?  Certainly  not  poor  old  Apple Computer,  whose  sinking  ship  I  think  can  be  partially attributed to the PPC which drained the critical development away from more important tasks (like multitasking, TCP/IP support, Internet).     Although  I  understand  the intended benefits of PPC architecture and its contribution to  computer  engineering,  I  do  not  understand  why Motorola had to drop the 68K line of CPUs. I would have much  preferred  that  Motorola  put  their  energy  into creating a 200-300 MHz 69040 CPU for a reasonable cost.

Nothing  beats  CPU  speed!  That  was  a  lesson  I learned back in the late 1980s while working for Apple on its  'supercomputer  on  a  chip'  quad  parallel  processor project from some of the world's leading CPU designers. Raw speed can make up for many other CPU inefficiencies. Think about it: if raising the clock speed can benefit the obscenely ugly architecture of the 80x86, just think what it would have meant for the 68K CPUs. Would you want to upgrade your Amiga to, say, 250 MHz for $200? I would.

stopped  buying  Macs  when  the  PPC  version  was  introduced  (with  all  of  their  associated  problems,  broken software, slow performance, etc.) I own five Macs, all 68K based.  The  downside  of  moving  to  a  PPC  Mac  was  not worth the gain. Do you think end users care about CPUs? They don't! Proof: Intel.

So… how much time have we all wasted here dealing with the PPC? Perhaps it would have been better worth our while to convince Motorola to simply build a 400 MHz 68030 or 68040! Perhaps we still should?   That's what I told Ted Waitt last May when we talked. It seemed that if anyone had the clout to make Motorola wake up, it would be Gateway. Ted seemed to like the idea. Where has it gone from there? I don't know.

Perhaps some of you think that I am old fashioned and need to get with the CPU bandwagon. Hey, I don't care if my car's engine is piston, rotary, or electric… what I care about is end performance, its acceleration, torque, and top RPM. And, if I'm going to be the one who opens the hood, I also care about its simplicity and elegance of design. (My usual plug for better OS design.)

Yet one more opinion for you.

Motorola gave up on the 68K much too early! It was not  such  a  bad  design!  And,  certainly  the  shift  was  not worth the marketplace that has been lost. What, now with 20/20 hindsight, has the PPC really bought the Macintosh? Loss  of  market  share.  Do  you  know  how  many  people

## Microsoft to Buy U.S.

Purchase Called 'Logical Extension of … Planned Growth' Purchase Price Not Disclosed

R EDMOND, Wash.  -  Oct.  21,  1997  -  In  direct response to accusations made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it  will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America for an undisclosed sum.

'It's  actually  a  logical  extension  of  our  planned growth,' said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. 'It really is going to be a positive arrangement for everyone.'

Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and  assured  members  of  the  press  that  changes  will  be 'minimal.' The United States will be managed as a wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be profitable by 'Q4 1999 at latest,' according to Microsoft president Steve Ballmer.

In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had 'willingly and enthusiastically' accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the  United  States  government,  reporting  directly  to  Bill Gates.  When asked how it felt  to  give  up  the  mantle  of executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to  it  as  'a  relief.'  He  went  on  to  say  that  Gates  has  a 'proven track record,' and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates  their  'full  support  and  confidence.'  Clinton  will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he  has  earned  as  U.S.  president,  in  his  new  role  at Microsoft.

Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as 'silly,' though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates went on to say  that  the  House  and  Senate  would  'of  course'  be abolished. 'Microsoft isn't a democracy,' he observed, 'and look how well we're doing.'

When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding, Gates said, 'We don't deny that discussions  are  taking  place.'  Microsoft  representatives closed the conference by stating that United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.

The Best of The BBS Uploads Selected by Bill Raecke

I t's a good month for gamers. You'll find a Yahtzee game (YTZP.LZX)  for  four  players  (computer  or  human). There's also a nicely done 'Asteroids' game (WBSTEROIDS13.LZX) that plays in a window right on the  Workbench,  and  the  latest  incarnation  of  Poing (POING5.LZX),  the  sideways  'Breakout'  game.  There's also a new version of Diamond Caves I I (DIAMONDCAVESII12.LZX), the 'Emerald Mine' clone. Any of these games is well worth spending some time with.

We've added fifteen new and outstanding pictures this month. All are digitized pics of animals. There are two new wolf pictures (can't have too many of those), a parrot, a cheetah and eleven pictures of seagulls. Take a look at the examples… they're even better in color.

If you've used Windows95, you may have found that you liked the taskbar along the bottom of the screen that is used for switching between tasks and for starting new tasks. Well, now you can have the same thing on your Amiga. ScreenTab  (SCREENTAB\_3.2.LZX)  offers  much  of  the same  functionality.  Your  system's  open  screens  are  dis-

Scout (SCOUT.LZX) is (in my humble opinion) the best of the system monitor programs. It's been upgraded again this month. It shows things like the running tasks and how much CPU power each of those tasks in consuming, what libraries have been loaded and what versions they are, what fonts are in use, etc. It does everything via a very nice point and click GUI interface. If you don't have it, get it. If you have it, get the upgrade.

Last, but not least, is an upgrade  to  Lupe (LUPE1.9.LZX). Lupe is a magnifying glass program… it lets you get a really good look at things when you need to. Unlike many lesser versions of the same thing, Lupe has a sizeable  window,  offers  variable  magnification  levels  and can open on any screen. It works on all screen types, too even CyberGraphX screens. It's not something you need every day, but when you need it, it's good to have. AGM

## Amiga by the Loop Meeting Notes for October and November Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

October  wasn't  much  of  an  Amiga  news  month, which  is  about  normal.  Our  club  was  busy  with  the Extravaganza. If you missed it, you really missed it! I really hope we can get back to the MetCom of the past in the future. Considering how things are going, I believe we did really well.

Our meeting began with talk about the Extravaganza

Zip drive is in trouble with that kind of competition.

For  our  main  presentation  we  finished  a  previous presentation. We finally got the battery in Ned Kelly's 4000 replaced - and it worked!

November  continues  our  lack  of  Amiga  news. Somehow I hope this lack of news is like a big spring being compressed, and someday it is going to release and we are going to be knocked over by the news. I thought this was about to happen even. Various people kept pointing to a big show in Germany where big news about the Amiga was to be announced. All that was said was the same thing that had  been  said  before.  Basically  that  great  things  were coming. The strangest news came from the head of Amiga International who said he thought the future Amiga would be powered by a 200MHz 68080. I hope someone misunderstood him, or Motorola hasn't been truthful with us. Another round of waiting, and gossip lay ahead for sure.

We started off the meeting with talk on the success of the flea market. As I mentioned, I thought it went rather well.  We  then  cast  our  vote  for  the  slate  of  officers

![Image](1997_12_artifacts/image_000010_61b25c90b9eded50c260547a016963d50a78fc9a667929cbb0dff310c40d11c8.png)

and  naming  candidates for  the  officers  of  the club.  From  there  we moved to a talk session. We  started  off  with  a question  on  which  to get: a scan doubler or a graphics card. The graphics card definitely wins  just  about  any comparison  of  those two.  Next  we  heard about  the  new  Sony Mavica camera that uses  regular  3.5  inch floppies  to  record  the images. This should make it easy to use on the Amiga, as the Amiga easily  reads  PC formatted  disks…  the same  format  used  by the  camera.  A  discussion on removable format drives and what to get was next. Lots of choices  here.  The  real news  here  is  the  new SyQuest SparQ drive. 1 GB capacity that comes with one disk for $199 and you can buy a pack of  three  disk  for  $99! That's  4  Gigabytes  of storage  for  $398!  The

rnal presented last month. Did I say vote? Voting for officers is more a confirmation of a group of volunteers. Continuing this process, we presented the group of volunteers for the chapter  officers,  for  which  confirmation  will  take  place next month. The first discussion of the meeting was proxy problems on Voyager. Having a computer on hand with Voyager made this easy to explain. This is something we've needed on many meetings, a computer to help explain and show how to do these various things people ask about. Sure helped  tonight!  We  next  discussed  3.1  and  scanner problems. 3.1 brings up interesting topics. The people in control of the Amiga have been telling of the coming of 3.5 and 4.0 versions of our operating system. The first mention of 3.5 gave November as a release date. That's come and gone! Spring '98 has been rumored - now late '98 is the word. The first word on 3.5 said no new ROMs - now new ROMs will be required. I don't think this will get any better 'till Gateway has everything straightened out and is ready to speak. 'Till then I wish they would get these guys together so they can get their story straight.

Tonight, Mark Stodola brought his 3000 out to show us a tape backup and the latest in game software. The tape backup features a DAT drive. DAT drives use a small tape capable of holding up to 4GB of data. They are reasonably fast for the way they work, and require little supervision over their  process.  The  other  demonstration  covered  the demo for a new game about to be released. Genetic Species is  a  long awaited Doom clone for the Amiga. There have been a few of these clones already, but they have nothing like Genetic Species. Genetic Species will take advantage of everything  introduced  over  the  years  to  improve  the Amiga.  Got  a  graphics  card?  It  can  use  it!  Got  an  accelerator? It can use it! Got a sound card? It can use it! The demo on my system using my sound card has 16 channels of sound! Everything about this demo has to be seen to be believed. If you want to see it, you can download it from the BBS, or get the librarian to get you a copy. The only bad thing I can say is that it is hard to play. The keyboard controls are less than precise. Get it anyway, try it, and get ready to buy it. Vulcan says it will be ready early next year. I'm ready.

## Amiga North Dallas Meeting Michael Turner

Due to Traffic related problems, 'yours truly' arrived a little bit late and missed the beginning of the meeting but I  think  I  managed  to  catch  the  most  interesting  bits. Among them were several interesting questions this month mostly related to using the Amiga on the Internet for email. One member wondered if there was a Juno or Junolike program for the Amiga.

Thomas Dye,now working at CompUSA, mentioned that the new SparQ drives are now on the shelves. These are removable harddrives that hold about one gigabyte of memory on a disk. Yes, that's right, one gig! He says that they run about $200 right now and there are models for parallel ports and also models that will run on a SCSI setup.

Also, Richard Levine mentioned he had used a shop to  repair  some  video  equipment  which  he  uses  with  his Video Toaster and that they did a good job and charged him a flat rate for the repair. Another member mentioned that he  had  used  the  same  shop  and  also  liked  their  work. Although they couldn't remember the name of the shop, they mentioned it was located on the intersection of Coit and Campbell.

As it is close to the end of the year it is time to vote on officers for next year. As such, we chose new officers for the coming year. Here is the new slate so far:

President:

Thomas Dye

Vice-President:

Richard Levine

Treasurer:

Gus Reiter

Secretary:

Michael Turner

Librarian:

John Cummings

Of course, since  these  offices  are  not  voted  on  'till next month, if anyone would like to run or has suggestions concerning such please mention them next meeting.

Speaking of next month, Thomas Dye has graciously agreed to hold the annual Christmas meeting at his home. We will hold our December meeting on December 16, the third Tuesday of the month as usual.

The address is 2941 Moss Creek Court in McKinney. Assuming one is going North on I-75, take exit 39 which is El Dorado Pkwy. Go left (west) on El Dorado. Take a right (north) on the first street after Country Club 'till you hit Abbey. Take a left (west) on Abbey and follow it and it becomes Moss Creek. Thomas' home is just after the curve. The location is shown on Mapsco page 360X. Bring your computer, your favorite game and some muchies! Meeting time is the regular 7:30 p.m. See Ya'll There!
