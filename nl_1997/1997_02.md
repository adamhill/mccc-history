## Cyber 3000

## The Cyberstorm, Cybervision64 and CyberGraphX Combination by Johnny C. Kitchens

W hen the  Amiga  was  introduced  in  1985,  it represented a new price performance level to the world of computing, more so the performance level. Part of my enjoyment has been exploring to upper limits  of  performance  for  the  Amiga.  While  my  first Amiga, the 1000, was limited in its scope of enhancements, very  few  add-ons  actually  showed  up  for  it.  My  first accelerator was in the form of a 68000 running at twice the normal clock speed. It worked well, but it was not a big jump in performance. Only tests taking advantage of the math chip showed any serious improvements in speed. In real  world  everyday  usage  it  showed  little  change  in operation. It wasn't until I saw a GVP 68030 accelerator in operation that I knew what real acceleration looked like. Everything  was  recognizably  faster  in  every  way.  I  now knew what I wanted in my Amiga, SPEED!

I later purchased a 2500 with the A2620 card featuring  the  14MHz  68020.  Although  I  never  got  to  use  the A2620, as I replaced it with a GVP 28MHz 68030, I did get to  see  it  used.  It  was  definitely  faster  than  any  68000. Through time I advanced the 2500 up to the 68040, along with better hard drive controllers and hard drives, and the Picasso  II  for  graphics  acceleration  as  well.  I  was  really pleased with the machine. It did everything very quickly! During all of this time, one Amiga really caught my eye and thoughts, the 3000. The 3000 looked great and its specs were not anything shabby. With it's full 32 bit architecture, it  had  an  advantage  in  speed  in  many  ways.  It  had  one disadvantage for a very long time for me. It was expensive! It cost nearly $4000 at the time I paid $1895 for the 2500. Of course there was a new 2500 that had just been introduced, using the 68030, which was the reason for the drop in price for the older 2500. After the introduction of the 4000, the 3000 began dropping in price very rapidly. Even the 3000T was begining to look appealing. After the demise of Commodore, used 3000's became available at even better prices. This is how I came to acquire a 3000. Fellow club member, Mark Stodola, acquired a couple  of  3000's  at  a very  reasonable  price  and  I  bought  one  of  them.  It  is  a 16MHz version,  and  one  of  the  last  ones  made.  It  even included a rare high-density floppy drive. I wasn't worried about the 16MHz part since accelerators could speed that up, or at least most do. Next came the hard part, selling the 2500. The 2500 had been sitting here for over four and a half  years,  going  through  a  few  down  times,  doing  most things I needed it to do nicely. It had become just what the name implied, a friend. I was going to sacrifice it for the money needed to bring the 3000 up to speed. Fortunately, I sold it to someone that can provide a good home and allow me to get a look at it once and a while. In fact, this newsletter has been created on it! So long 2500, hello 3000.

Getting  the  3000  up  to  speed  seemed  like  a  slow process,  and  covered  a  full  year,  most  of  it  waiting  for something to arrive. At first I had to use the 3000 in its basic form, 16MHz 68030, 1 meg of fast ram, 1 meg of chip ram, and ECS graphics. This was a big drop from the 2500's performance level I was used to. Many things I was used to doing could not be accomplished now. Due to the 3000's enhanced architecture,  I  was  impressed  by  how  well  the basic  AmigaOS  performed  with  the  accelerated  custom chips.  Everything  seemed  to  move  along  very  well. Actually, this machine operates faster than the first 2500!

My first improvement came with the installation of more memory. I discovered that I had some 256x4 memory chips left over from some past computer work. This gave me 2 megs of chip and 1 meg of fast. A small improvement, but  a  usable  one.  After  looking  at  what  was  available,  I decided  to  get  a  CyberVision64  graphics  card.  This  is  a graphics  accelerator  card  that  features  the  S3  Trios64 graphics chip. It features a 64 bit data processing, 64 bit data paths,  4  megs  of  memory,  a  64  bit  blitter,  and  a  chip  to handle the planar to chunky conversion. It also includes the CyberGraphX software package, which does all the work to get Workbench using more colors up to and including

24bit. There was some talk of it being considered as a new standard, to be included in new Amigas coming. Sounded good to me, and the test results in the magazine showed it in good light. I placed an order with Softwood, the official distributor for phase5. (I wonder why they spell their name with a lower case letter?) I inquired about the availability of the  Cyberstorm  MkII,  the  060  accelerator  coming  from phase5. I was told it would be another two weeks before it would be available. Little did I know this would be the first of many times that I would hear those words. Since phase5 recommended the Super Buster revision 11 to get optimum performance from the Cybervision64, I decided to order it as  well  as  the  other  chips  that  had  been  updated  by Commodore since the 3000's introduction.

'My machine, that had taken 48 seconds to boot up with the 3000 controller, now was taking just 25 seconds with the Warp.'

The chips arrived in a few days, so I decided to install them rather than wait for the card. Good thing, as I was about to make a discovery that few knew existed. The new Super Buster does not work running at 16MHz! Although my machine booted  up  OK  and  ran  just  fine,  the  cards plugged into the expansion slots didn't show up! I thought the chip was bad. I tried two more and they didn't work either. I began to wonder if Super Buster revision 11 would run at  16MHz. Commodore had this problem when the 3000  was  introduced.  They  had  two  versions  of  Super Buster, for each speed of the 3000. Finally I got confirmation of my suspicions from a couple of replies to a post I made on the Internet. This prompted me to look for an accelerator sooner than planned. The accelerators I had seen clocked  the  motherboard  of  the  16MHz  3000  up  to 25MHz. After calling around and talking to many people, one thing was sure - the 68060 accelerators were behind schedule due to slow deliveries of the 68060 from Motorola. The only accelerator available for the 3000 was the Warp Engine from Macro Systems… well, sort of. Everywhere I called  was  out  of  it.  Rumors  of  the  coming  68060's  had caused Macro System to drop it, or at least that's what I was being told. After calling every place I could find an ad for,  I  located  just  one.  They  were  advertising  a  nice  low price compared to others, but my inquiry showed they had raised  the  price  due  to  demand.  I  decided  to  order  it anyway. I am glad I did, or I would have had to use the machine as it was for a very long time.

The card arrived in two days. This unit is the 40MHz 68040 version of the card, very similar to the one made for the 4000, but with only two SIMM sockets angled over for clearance purposes. Nowhere in any advertisements or in the manual would my next discovery be covered. The card would not fit my machine! I had to cut a hole in the floppy drive mounting plate for the fan and heat sink to stick up through.  After  much  cutting  I  finally  had  it  in.  It  even started up OK.

This was a serious performance upgrade for the 3000! I put twelve megs of memory on the card at first and later I would move it up to twenty-four megs… more memory than I ever had before. Only PageStream would ever use up that  much memory, I found out. I was really excited by how fast my 3000 was. The Warp Engine was fast in itself, plus it clocked the motherboard up to 25MHz. That added another  boost  to  the  way  the  machine  operated  as  well. Now if that Cybervision64 would just show up. It did, but it had taken fourteen weeks. I called Softwood several times about the card, and always got the same answer… another two weeks. It was worth the wait, as I finally had a machine that could bring back the magic of my previous machine. The Cybervision64 is so far the fastest Zorro III graphics card  available.  It  easily  beats  the  competition  at  most things, and is only a little faster at a few things. For the most  part  it's  faster  than  the  competition.  Now  my machine was fast  and  usable.  I  could  really  use  it  again. PageStream was a usable program again, although the latest version then used most of my memory during printing.

After using the Warp for a while I decided to hook my hard drives up to its Fast SCSI 2 controller. The 3000 has a very fast SCSI controller built right onto the motherboard. It was just as fast as or faster than any of the controllers I had for the 2500. The Warp's controller is faster yet.  It  measured  out  at  twice  the  speed  of  the  3000  controller. One of my drives really responded to its improvement.  A respectable 1.8 megs of data transfer on the 3000's built in controller jumped to 5.5 on the Warp's controller! My machine, that had taken 48 seconds to boot up with the 3000 controller, now was taking just 25 seconds with the Warp. Both of those times were with the 68040 running in optimum settings and the hard drive defragmented.

The 40MHz is the fastest speed the 68040 has been offered in by Motorola and that made it about two and a half times faster than the fastest 50MHz 68030 chip. Many operations in the chip have been optimized to execute in one  clock  cycle,  versus  two  or  more  for  the  68030.  To further  improve  performance  the  math  chip  has  been moved into the 68040. Looking at the 68030 on the 3000 motherboard and comparing it to the 68040 on the Warp gives a fair idea of the performance gain. The 68040 looks really big in comparison. One feature of the Warp that was appealing to me was the promise of a future upgrade to the 68060.  To  this  day  no  word  has  come  of  when  or  if  the upgrade will show. My own attempts to contact them, both by phone and fax, have failed to get an answer.

This  new  combination  was  very  fast  compared  to anything I had used before. Many normal operations were taking place so quickly it's hard to believe that it's the same

machine running the same programs. Just as I was about to get  used  to  the  new  improvement  in  performance,  along comes the chance to get more. I had begun to wonder if the 68060 would ever show up in enough numbers to make it readily available. So far only a few had shown up around the world, and their owners were feeling privileged indeed. Then it was announced that Motorola had gotten their act together  and  the  68060  would  be  available  in  enough numbers to satisfy the demand.  I  called  Softwood, and  started  a  new  round  of 'two  weeks  till  it  arrives' statements. This would be a recurring statement from May till September when the Cyberstorm MkII would arrive at my house.

With  the  Cyberstorm MkII,  phase5  has  outdone itself in producing a versatile accelerator  card.  Until  its introduction, there were accelerators  for  4000,  and accelerators  for  3000.  These accelerators even had trouble with  the  tower  versions  of the  respective  models.  The Cyberstorm  MkII  works  in all  four  models!  It  also  is amazing in that there is only one jumper on the card, and that  is  to  allow  writing  to the onboard FlashROM when needed. The many advantages, I cannot see why phase5 would miss this simple procedure to fix the problem other than to save cost. Still, they provided the instructions to permanently fix the problem forever.  How  many  people  will  want  to  solder their motherboard, or pay a professional to do it? I was all prepared  to  do  it  when  I  discovered  another  problem apparently  no-one  outside  of  phase5  knew  of.  The CyberSCSI device  apparently  was  not  designed  with  the

![Image](1997_02_artifacts/image_000002_d98c7f9571fcfee2f96c3849f25408ec1e78a0176847351f5ae971e14cfc5ab9.png)

FlashROM  is  something  new  to  Amiga  accelerators, allowing updates to the accelerator when needed, without removing the card although the jumper does mean some disassembly to get to it. It also offered the largest memory expansion for the 3000, a full 128 megs. The Warp for the 3000 could only go to 64 megs with its two SIMM slots although they did not recommend using 32 meg SIMMs in the manual. The real star of this accelerator is of course the 50MHz 68060. This chip gives the Amiga many of the latest CPU features currently showing up on other platforms. I will cover those a little later.

Along  with  Cyberstorm  MkII,  I  ordered  the CyberSCSI  controller  that  adds  Fast  SCSI  II  to  the  accelerator. After experiencing the Warp's SCSI controller, I knew I would have to have that on the new accelerator. With the accelerator there is a sheet explaining that Zorro III DMA cards will not work with the 3000 without some modification  to  the  3000  motherboard.  Seems  that Commodore left out a line that sent timing signals between the  accelerator  and  the  Zorro  III  bus.  The  Warp  had  a simple wired clip that took care of this easily. With all of its

3000  in  mind.  When  it  is mounted on the accelerator, it  would  stick  out  from  the side  of  the  3000  by  about three inches. A call to Softwood  showed  that  they were  unaware  of  the  problem.  After  several  weeks  of calling to get  something straightened out, a fix in the future  was  promised.  'Til then  I  would  have  to  make do  with  the  slower  3000 controller.  During  the  long wait  for  the  accelerator  to arrive,  the  price  of  memory had been dropping rapidly. I took advantage of the situation  and  stocked  up. This would give me 56 megs of  Fast  RAM,  4  megs  of Graphics RAM  on the Cybervision64,  and  2  megs on the Chip RAM.

Installation of the card would provide a full day of fun  and  excitement.  Moving  the  Warp  to  its  new  home took up most of the day. Trying to get the machine to boot up  with  it  provided  many  trying  moments.  It  finally worked after  my  getting  serious  with  seating  it  into  the accelerator slot. This allowed me to turn my attention to my machine. One of my fears turned out to be true. The Cyberstorm MkII does not provide a clock signal to the motherboard. While awaiting the arrival of the card I had worked out an alternate plan. I would reclock the motherboard  by  removing  its  crystal  and  replacing  it  with  the appropriate one. I bought a socket to make future switches easy  as  well.  The  plan  sounds  simpler  than  the  actual execution was. Getting the motherboard out of the chassis was a new experience, but at least it gave me a chance to see the hidden part of the motherboard. Removing the existing crystal  proved  to  be  a  tough  job.  The  solder  resisted melting  even  with  140  watt  soldering  gun.  After  several hours  of  heating  and  pulling  it  was  free  and  my  main worry,  damaging  the  motherboard,  never  happened. Installing the crystal socket failed completely. The socket fell apart under the heat of the soldering gun, the mother-

board still shows no sign of heat damage. Oddly enough while looking over the motherboard I noticed that another crystal did have a socket for easy removal. Why one and not the other? Getting the other crystal in was nearly as hard as getting the original out. I ended up installing and removing the motherboard two more times. I thought I had damaged the  motherboard  on  the  final  attempt  to  get  it right, but it turned out to be one loose connection on the crystal.  Finally  the  68060  was  up  and  running.  With  the installation  of  the  Cyberstorm,  Cybervision64,  and CyberGraphX, could say that phase5 has really helped me create a Cyber3000!

The 68060 apparently will be the end of a long line of successful  chips  from  Motorola.  Motorola has decided to concentrate on the PowerPC, although one more version, a 66MHz, may be forthcoming. This 68060 has been given just  about every feature new and or used in CPUs introduced in the last ten years. Currently there appears to be a competition between CISC and RISC based chip designs taking place. CISC being the traditional chip design, where all  the  CPU's commands are buried in the chip, thus the name CISC that stands for Complex Instruction Set Chip. The  other  design,  RISC,  that  stands  for  Reduced Instruction Set Chip, has most of its instructions carried externally,  and  provided  by  the  programmer.  Its  internal instructions are simpler and execute quicker. The 68060 is of the CISC group but has adopted several features of the RISC design. Here's how Motorola describes the 68060.

'The 68060 is a 32-bit processor with a superscalar, pipelined architecture. It has more than 2 million transistors, using a 0.5 micron, triple-layer metal, 3.3 volt process in a static design. Separated in the 060 are instruction caches and data caches; instruction fetch pipelines (with four-stage instruction processor, a physically-mapped 8Kbyte instruction  cache  with  four-way  self  instruction  buffer),  and operand  execution  pipelines  (with  four-stage  operand processor, a physically mapped 8Kbyte data cache with 4way interleaving and a 4-entry, 32-bit write buffer). 68060 has  the  ability  to  execute  more  than  one  instruction  per clock  cycle  due  to  two  parallel  instruction  pipelines  for integer  instruction  and  also  a  third  pipeline  for  floating point  instructions.  The  chip  also  has  the  ability  to  do branch prediction to increase the speed even more.'

What does all of this mean? FAST!!! That's what it means. The original 68000 used in the 1000, 2000, and 500 had  a  rating  of  about  .35  MIPS.  The  40MHz  68040  was given a rating of about 25 MIPS. The 50MHz 68060 gets a 82 MIPS rating. This goes with Motorola's original plan of exceeding the 25MHz 68040's performance by about 2.5 to 3.5 times. Tests I have run have shown that many times, it is only delivering about 75% of its full potential. This has to do with the way the programs were originally written. A few 68060 optimized programs have shown up, but time will tell if more will show up. Programs optimized for the 68040 run very well, and a few really fly!

Although Motorola has moved the PowerPC up to confront  the  Intel  chips,  the  68060  still  shows  favorably against them. One area the 68000's beats the Intel chips in were in the number of registers. In a comparison between the 68060 and the Pentium we see that it is still true. The Pentium has 8 32bit integer registers and 8 64bit floating point registers. The 68060 has 16 32bit integer registers and 16  64bit  floating  point  registers.  Several  comparisons between the Amiga running the 68060 and some Pentium based PCs showed the 68060 compared favorably to or beat the Pentiums running from 90 to 120MHz. Motorola has said that they intend to make 66 and 80MHz versions, but only the 66 is mentioned on their website.

## 'PageStream now operates so smoothly that it is like a totally new package. I can rotate objects very smoothly.'

The Cyberstorm MkII combined with the Cybervision64 gives the Amiga an awesome leap in performance in many areas, but a few tests showed only a modest performance increase. This appears to be tied to the FPU instructions that need to be emulated for the 68060. The Cyberstorm MkII comes with a program called CyberPatcher that watches for those offending instructions and makes the proper changes to make them work better. This  gives  the  Cyberstorm  a  great  advantage  over  the competition. Unfortunately, many tests turn off multitasking, killing the programs' advantage. This will show up the 68060 in a less than favorable light in those tests. AIBB, one of  the  best  known  benchmark  programs,  really  cuts  the 68060 short. To even get it to run I have to convince it I am running a 50MHz 68010 with no Math Chip! Even with that handicap it still wins the test. A few just barely beat the  competition,  and  they  were  using  Floating  Point operations.  In  a  test  of  graphical  performance,  the Cyberstorm/Cybervision64  combo  beat  out  a  4000  by nearly 30 times!

Two things really improved for me that really made the  combination  a  winner.  PageStream  now  operates  so smoothly that it is like a totally new package. I can rotate objects very smoothly. Page redraws happen very quickly, enhancing productivity in every way. I even created a small test  to  show  how much faster it is. I created a large title with  TrueType  fonts  and  then  used  TextFX  to  alter  the looks of the text. The 40MHz 68040 took 18.13 seconds to make the change. The 50MHz 68060 took 11.67 seconds to accomplish the same task. That sure did not seem like a great  improvement  but,  still  it  was  better.  Then  phase5 brought out their first software update package. Everything seemed faster with the new software. I ran the PageStream

test again. I could not believe the results, it only took 1.39 seconds! Now that's a speed-up worth the price. The other thing I enjoy doing that benefits from a faster accelerator card  is  the  Internet.  The  Internet  requires  lots  of  image decoding and the 68060 does that very quickly - especially compressed images like GIF and JPEG images that are the format of choice there. The Internet looks better with 256 colors,  and  it  really  benefits  from  the  Cybervision64 graphics  capabilities.  I  am  also  allowed  to  use  higher resolutions  to  show  more  of  the  pages  as  well.  I  prefer 800x600,  as  that  seems  to  offer  the  best  compromise. Calling up pages from the cache created by the browser are recalled  instantly  most  of  the  time.  One  page  I  use frequently took about 15 seconds for the 40MHz 68040 to recall and that was when the page was 212K in size. Now it is  256K  in  size  and  takes  but  8  seconds  to  do  the  same. While  on  the  subject  of  graphics,  the  combination  of Cyberstorm, Cybervision64, and CyberGraphX make all forms  of  graphics  better.  Images,  MPEGs,  Quicktime videos, AVIs, and everything else work so much better. The only thing I am currently waiting for is the ability to view MPEGs with audio, a promised feature of the next MPEG viewer release. Quicktime and AVIs currently do play at full speed with audio. The Quicktime videos are definitely the better format from what I have seen.

As far as I am concerned this combination of boards is  definitely  worth  considering  for  all  3000(T)/4000(T) owners. The only problem as I type this, the Cybervision64 is  no  more.  A  new  board  has  just  hit  the  market  from phase5. Cybervision64/3D featuring, as the name says, 3D graphics.  This  card  offers  the  ability  to  fit  Zorro  II machines  as  well  as  Zorro  III.  A  new  CyberGraphX package has been announced to take advantage of its new abilities. As well, phase5 has announced a new accelerator package they call the PowerUP. It features a PowerPC chip in  conjunction  with  a  68040  or  68060  to  run  Amiga applications.  This  offers  compatibility  with  existing software as well as the ability to take advantage of software written  for  the  PowerPC.  They  say  that  PowerPC  programs  could  run  10  to  20  times  the  speed  of  current software!  That  is  a  serious  speed-up,  and  nearly  a  dozen companies are promising software for the new accelerator. Both of these cards pale in comparison to an announcement of  a  new  computer  from  phase5,  called  the  A\Box.  It features  a  whole  new  architecture  design  to  carry  the Amiga into the next century. If they pull this off, the whole Amiga  community  owes  them  a  big THANKS.  I  wish them  luck  on  the  project,  and  hope  to  see  it  soon. Although they have been late in delivering in the past, and a few announced items have never shown, they were only small  items.  They  have  delivered  some  very  impressive products so far. The A\Box is one big project that hopefully  will  deliver  as  advertised.  If  it  does,  we've  got  a winner. As for my machine, maybe it's time to take a look at one of those 16 bit sound cards. AGM

## BOD Report

## The January Meeting Results

## by Bill Raecke

C ontrary to  the  majority  of  Board  of  Director's Meetings, the January meeting resulted in several decisions which affect the club. Here is a synopis of what happened.

Our  bulk  mailing  permit  expired  and  a  discussion ensued as to whether it was time to drop it and go with first class  postage  from  this  point  forward.  The  permit  itself costs $80 annually and requires us to mail 200 copies of the newsletter even though we really need to mail only about 100  copies  to  members  and  other  clubs.  After  a  lengthy discussion, the decision was made to drop the permit and mail  our  newsletters  first  class  hereafter…  or  until  our membership increases.

The  next  subject  was  our  BBS  phone  lines.  Our decreasing membership has left us with a BBS that is not nearly as active as it once was, and a corresponding decrease in income leaves us with less cash to pay for our two metro phone lines. Those metro lines cost about $40 per month each. The BOD discussed the options of a) dropping one phone line entirely, b) converting one line to a local line, or c)  leaving  things  as  they  are  for  now.  After  a  lengthy discussion, the board decided to change one line to a local line for a savings of about $30 per month. This should have minimal impact on the membership since most callers are local  anyway… and we will still have one metro line for those who aren't.

The final major decision for the month involved our C64/128 Chapter. The chapter has expressed the opinion that they no longer get much benefit from membership in the MCCC. After much discussion the board decided that this  was  probably  true.  The  decision  was  made  to  offer their organization payment of the balance of MCCC dues for members wishing to leave the MCCC.

Having  finished  with  major  decisions,  the  Board decided to begin preparation of an official Web Site. I have that assignment. I will begin working on it as soon as I get this newsletter redesign behind me. AGM

## FTW Farewell

The C64/128 Chapter Splits Off by Mary Louise Hagemeyer

O nce upon a time, a marvelous new computer was introduced.  Eager  buyers  snapped  it  up,  took  it home, and stared at it. What could it do? Because it  was  so  new,  there  was  very  little  software  for  it,  and advice about using it was hard to find. So these new owners did  the  only  reasonable  thing  -  they  got  together  and formed the MCCC. That was back in February, 1983, when about  90  Commodore  64  and  VIC  20  users  met  in  the Hurst Library to start a club that would quickly grow to nearly 600 members.

Of  the  founding  fathers,  Bruce  Nelson  and  Garry Wordleman  remain  active  in  the  club. [Editor's  Note: Actually, only Garry Wordelman remains active at this time.] Those of us who attended the first meetings remember the intense interest in the question-and-answer sessions and the excitement  of  watching  a  new  game  and  taking  a  copy home. A year later, the meetings were so crowded that we couldn't hear the question or answer, so we divided into chapters  of  more  reasonable  size.  At  the  height  of  C64 interest, there were five chapters: Arlington, Fort Worth, Fort Worth Night, Grand Prairie, and H-E-B.

1985 was a really big year. First the club BBS went online, then the C128 appeared, followed by the Amiga. Soon an Amiga chapter was formed, and then several more, while the other chapters gradually shrank and merged. By the  time  Commodore International  went  under  in  1994, the MCCC had three Amiga chapters but only one 8-bit survivor, the Fort Worth group.

Although some sturdy die-hards in the Fort Worth Chapter  continue  to  meet,  we  realize  that  we  and  the

Amiga chapters have little to offer  each  other.  Therefore, we have agreed that it is time to  part.  The  Fort  Worth group will continue to meet informally at  the  UNT Health  Sciences  Bldg.  on Camp Bowie at Montgomery, the second Saturday of  the  month,  at  1:30.  For more  information,  contact Mike and Brenda Sessums at 817-238-9891 or e-mail, msessums@fastlane.net.

We've met many good people  in  the  MCCC  and have fond memories of good fellowship and shared experiences. Best wishes and HAPPY COMPUTING. AGM

## The Newsletter

Notice anything new? by Bill Raecke

I 've been busy this month. You've probably noticed by now  that  the  newsletter  sports  a  new  name  and  an updated look. There are plenty of changes behind the scenes as well that have kept me (are still keeping me) busy. First and foremost, the new newsletter is being produced with PageStream 3.2. This new PageStream is a wonderful product that has a lot of nifty new features that I promise to write about as soon as I get familiar enough with it that I can do that effectively. My overall impression is that this version is slanted much more toward the professional user. I  think it will improve my output a great deal once I get used  to  it.  In  the  meantime,  it's  so  new  that  I  find  I'm having to relearn a lot of things I thought I knew.

One  thing  that  I  didn't  like  about  the  new PageStream, however, was the output. Most users probably don't have a Postscript printer, and for those of us who don't, some of the options we used to enjoy for controlling halftone  output  went  away  with  the  upgrade.  Following Johnny  Kitchens'  advice,  I  purchased  Studio  II,  a  print control program. Studio II has drivers for just about every printer  available.  It  combines  seamlessly  with  both  the Workbench  (via  a  standard  print  driver)  and  with PageStream 3.2 (via a PageStream style driver). The result far  surpasses  anything  I  was  able  to  achieve  with PageStream 2.2. Studio II is another product I will write a review on as soon as I become more familiar with it. In the meantime, I'm getting  these  results  without  even  having read the manual.

The  last  remaining  behind-the-scenes  change  is  my purchase  of  a  new  printer.  I'm  now  using  a  Hewlett-

Packard  DeskJet  693C.  It does a beautiful 600dpi black and white output that's perfect  for  the  newsletter while  providing  me  with beautiful color output when I want  it (although the beautiful  color  requires  the aforementioned Studio II print driver).

So, this is the first MCCC newsletter produced with PageStream 3.2, Studio II, and an HP DeskJet 693C. Dig out your December '95 issue and compare the picture  of  the  jaguar  there with the one on this page. I think you'll notice a very big difference. AGM

## A Skier's Dictionary

Something to get you started in a popular winter sport Author Unknown

A LP - One of a number of places to ski in Europe. Also  a  shouted  request  for  assistance  made  by  a European  skier.  An  appropriate  reply:  'What's Zermatter?'

AVALANCHE - One of the few actual perils skiers face that  needlessly  frighten  timid  individuals  away  from  the sport. See also: BLIZZARD, CONTUSION, FRACTURE, FROSTBITE, HYPOTHERMIA, LIFT COLLAPSE.

BINDINGS - Automatic mechanisms that protect skiers from potentially serious injury during a fall  by  releasing skis from boots, sending the skis skittering across the slope where they trip over two other skiers, and so on and on, eventually  causing  the  entire  slope  to  be  protected  from serious injury.

BONES - Brittle  things  of  which  there  are  206  in  the human body. No need for dismay however: There are two bones in the middle ear that have never been broken in a ski accident.

CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING - Traditional Scandinavian all-terrain  snow-traveling  technique.  It's  good  exercise.  It doesn't require the purchase of costly lift tickets. It has no crowds or lineups. It isn't skiing. See CROSS-COUNTRY SOMETHING-OR-OTHER.

CROSS-COUNTRY SOMETHING-OR-OTHER  Touring on skis  along  trails  in  scenic  wilderness,  gliding through snow-hushed woods far from the hubbub of the ski slopes, hearing nothing but the whispery hiss of the skis slipping  through  the  snow  and  the  muffled  tinkle  of  car keys  dropping  into  the  puffy  powder  of  a  deep,  windsculped drift.

EXERCISES  -  A  few  simple  warm-ups  to  make  sure you've been protected for the slopes:  1. Tie a cinder block to each foot with old belts, and climb a flight of stairs.  2. Sit  on  the  outside  of  a  second-story  window  ledge  with your skis on and your poles in your lap for 30 minutes.  3. Bind your legs together at the ankles, lie flat on the floor; then, holding a banana in each hand, get to your feet.

GLOVES - Hand coverings designed to be tight enough around the wrist to restrict circulation, but not so closefitting as to allow any manual dexterity. They should admit moisture from the outside without permitting any dampness within to escape.

GRAVITY - One of  5  fundamental forces in nature affecting skiiers. The other four are the strong force which makes bindings  jam;  the weak  force  which makes  ankles  give way on turns; electromagnetism, which produces dead  batteries in expensive ski-resort parking  lots;  and the  last  one;  that when  an irresis-

![Image](1997_02_artifacts/image_000005_ef0a758621012f0ce396f18872ee16980e6bb1dd24474f174c370081f95b3de6.png)

table force meets an immovable object, an unethical lawyer will immediately appear.

PREJUMP - Manoevre in which an expert skier makes a controlled  jump  just  ahead  of  a  bump.  Beginners  may execute a controlled pre-fall just before losing their balance and. if they wish, can precede it with a prescream and a few pregroans and preobcenities.

SHIN - That bruised area on the front of the leg running from  the  point  where  the  ache  from  the  wretched  knee ends to that where the searing pain from the strained ankle begins.

SKI!  -  A  shout  made  to  alert  people  that  a  loose  ski  is coming down the hill. Another warning skiers should be familiar  with  is  'Avalanche!'  which  tells  everyone  that  a hill is coming down the hill.

SKIER - One who pays an arm and a leg for the chance to break them.

SKIS - A pair of long, thin, flexible runners that permit a skier to slide across the snow and into debt.

THOR - Thandinavian god of acheth and painth.

TRAVERSE - To ski across a slope at an angle; one of two quick and simple methods of reducing speed.

TREE - The other method.

## Library News

The Best of The BBS - On Disk by Bill Raecke

M CCC-A\_1214 EGSApps:  Distributed  in  archived  format,  this file  contains  PhotoAlbum  and  EGSTV.  The version of PhotoAlbum here is for EGS Amiga systems as opposed to the standard version which works on AGA and CyberGraphX  systems.  If  you  are  unfamiliar  with PhotoAlbum, you owe it to yourself to check it  out.  It shows a directory of pictures as thumbnails. You can then click on a thumbnail to display it full size. You can also use it  to  maintain databases of the images in your system for even  quicker  access.  The  EGSTV  is  an  EGS  version  of CyberTV, an animation player.

LabelMerge: LabelMerge is an ARexx script for PageStream 3.x that allows you to build labels using a template and an external  file  of  names  and  addresses.  Simple  enough  to explain, but very handy to use.

QT: A QuickTime animation player. System requirements are a 68020 or better processor, AmigaOS 3.x, and either AGA or CyberGraphX. If you don't have this basic setup, time to upgrade.

MCCC-A\_1215

ChaosPro: ChaosPro is the most powerful fractal explora- tion program I have encountered. It s u p p o r t s t h e Mandelbrot and Julia sets, of course; but it a l s o s u p p o r t s Lyapunov Space, Plasma,  and  lots  of other  mathematical set.  To  make  things more interesting, the program operates  in any screen mode up to 256 colors. If that isn't enough,  you can generate  your final  versions  in  full 24-bit splendor. If you  haven't  seen  a Mandelbrot displayed in 24-bit color, you don't know  what  you're missing.

CyberShow:  The  premier  picture  viewing  utility  for CyberGraphX  and  AGA  systems.  It  shows  pictures  in about any resolution your system can handle and it handles about 20 picture file types internally. Beyond that, it will handle whatever you have a datatype for. But it's not just a picture viewer - it will also serve as a very nice slideshow program, complete with fancy screen wipes - and it will save  pictures  in  many  formats  as  well,  which  makes  it  a nice,  simple  picture  format  conversion  program  as  well. The version on the disk (8.2) will be your update if you have the registered version. If you haven't registered yet, you  can  still  use  this  demo,  but  pictures  will  only  be displayed in grey scale.

MCCC-A\_1216 MCC\_MonthNavigator:  MCC  stands  for  MUI  Custom Class. This MUI add-on adds calendar functions to the MUI GUI class library. As with everything in the MUI GUI, this does  nothing  unless  you  have  a  program  that  uses  the class... but you really should keep your system current and ready for that next MUI application that's probably just around the corner. In the meantime, a nice calendar demo program is included.

Poing4: Remember the old original breakout game? This is

![Image](1997_02_artifacts/image_000008_9f105c500787b421307d38929fd1030c1db9fd8a9486f091112ca4f1065cb294.png)

another of the many games based on that old standard. In this one, the 'ball' moves side to side. One thing that sets this  one  apart  is  that  it's  possible  to  break  through  the 'wall'  on  the  right  to  another  screen,  even  before  the current screen has been cleared. I don't need to go into long explanations here do I? Just get it and try it. You'll like it.

Tracker-Music: I'm picky when it comes to MOD music. Most of it is closer to noise than music... so it's unusual that I find something good enough to include on an MCCC disk.  Heck,  most  of  the  music  I  download  never  even makes it to the BBS (there's no sense wasting everyone's time in addition to my own). Ballada is a nice quiet tune... an interesting melody with a quiet guitar and flute arrangement. Kind of a Celtic sound to it. Highly recommended.

MCCC-A\_1217

AmigaT:  AmigaT  is  a  program  intended  to  be  used  in scripts.  It  will  return  information  about  the  CPU  being used,  whether  a  floating-point  processor  is  available,  etc. And it returns the information in such a way that a script can interpret the results and make decisions based on the outcome. If  you  have  a  system  that  can  be  booted  with multiple  configurations,  you  could  probably  use  this program.

GIF-Pictures:  This  is  a  nice  one...  an  aerial  picture  of  a portion of New York City. I'm not familiar enough with the city to know where this is, but a couple of bridges are in the shot. It's a nice, high-quality picture.

MPegVideo\_datatype:  Just  what  it  says.  It's  an  MPEG datatype.  Install  it  and  you'll  be  able  to  view  MPEG animations with MultiView. AGM

A True Story From a Novell NetWire SysOp

C aller: 'Hello, is this Tech Support?' Tech: 'Yes, it is. How may I help you?'

Caller:  'The  cup  holder  on  my  PC  is  broken  and  I  am within  my  warranty  period.  How  do  I  go  about  getting that fixed?'

Tech: 'I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?'

Caller: 'Yes. It's attached to the front of my computer.'

Tech: 'Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, because I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a trade show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it have any trademark on it?'

Caller: 'It came with my computer. I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has '4x' on it.'

At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he  couldn't  stand  it.  The  caller  had  been  using  the  load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive! AGM

There are some micro-organisms that exhibit characteristics of both plants and animals. When exposed to light they undergo photosynthesis; and when the lights go out, they turn into animals. But then again, don't we all?

## Amiga Central Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

December brings many things with it every year. The happiness of Christmas, as well as sadness brought to us by certain  news  stories  and  events.  A  new  variation  to  our unpredictable weather… as in cold. We get to have hope in the new year as in approaches, and we get to see how our reelected President gets to do things for the next four years. For  our  club  we  get  to  have  a  slightly  different  type  of meeting, as a party! There is not a great deal to say about the meeting other than it was fun for some, entertaining for others, filling for some, and the North Dallas chapter got their officers elected. Thanks to all the people who brought food and hardware to keep us all entertained. I hope we can do it again next year!

very good idea.

After much discussion about these changes we moved on  to  some  general  discussions.  A  member  was  having problems with MagicWorkbench. After a lengthy discussion it sounded as if we needed to do a hands on examination of his system to figure out his problem.

Then  the  main  part  of  the  meeting  got  underway. Our club librarian, Ned Kelly, was having problems with his CD-ROM drive and decided that a club meeting would be a good place to figure out the problem. Several proposals for  other  experiments  or  demos  using  the  machine  were suggested  as  well,  my  favorite  being  the  static  electricity discharge example. We pressed on, only to discover our first problem:  Someone  forgot  to  bring  a  CD  caddy  for  the drive. We went to an alternate plan, using a different drive. This  allowed  us  to  test  the  controller  to  see  if  it  was working properly. In short we did not get it to work. We also  managed  to  get  one  hard  drive  to  stop  working, hopefully temporarily. We also uncovered a few things that need adjustment, such as CPU CACHEs that neeeded to be turned on! The real fun of this meeting was that so many were  involved  and  we  seemed  to  be  enjoying  ourselves. This is the type of meeting we need a few more of every year.  Now  if  we  can  just  find  more  people  to  volunteer their machines to our scrutiny. Hey, maybe the guy with the Magic Workbench problem can be persuaded to bring his machine!

January 1997 brings a new year for the club - and what  a  start  we  have  had!  It  began with one of the most productive and exciting  officer  meetings  I  have  ever attended.  We  accomplished  more  in that one meeting than in years worth of  previous  meetings.  Many  of  the things  covered  in  that  meeting  have already begun to show up in the club operations.  One  of  those  things  was the  first  to  show  up  at  our  meeting. The C-64 Chapter is no longer a part of  our  club.  Also,  our  club  will  be dropping  one  of  our  metro  phone lines, and replacing it with a conventional  line  number.  Our  newsletter publisher announced that the newsletter would be getting a new look. The club is in the process of seeking a new name.  If  you  have  any  suggestions, send them to us. We need a name that better  represents  the  Amiga  and  our users. Our library had a few changes as  well.  Our  disks  now  feature  FFS format  for  improved  disk  performance.  The  other  involves  what  is available on the disks. Only the best will be available on disks, which is a
