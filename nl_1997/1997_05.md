## Dallas Meetings

A New and Better Location

The  Community  Room  in  the  Richardson  Square Mall has served us well for the past year or so. Due to my job, we now have a place with more technical amenities available…  like  phone  lines,  a  large  screen  TV,  and  a projection display which works on wintel computers. The only problem is that the doors lock themselves at about 7:00pm, and the meeting is actually supposed to start at 7:30pm. To get around that problem I am planning on getting  a  cheap  pair  of  walkie-talkies.  I'll  leave  one outside the front door to contact us inside the building. Another  way  to  get  a  hold  of  us  once  we  are  in  the meeting  room  is  to  call  us  at  972-931-9005  and  dial extension 291. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at home: 972-713-8660 or at work, 972931-9005 extension 207, or just ask for Gus. Thanks.

## By-The-Loop Meetings

Another New and Better Location

The  Amiga  by  the  Loop  chapter  is  once  again moving to a new location. Our May meeting will be in the NEW Bell Helicopter Training Facilities at the intersection of Norwood and Trintity Blvd. If you exit Trinity Blvd  from  820,  you  will  go  about  3  miles  to  the  East. From  our  old  meeting  location,  it's  south  across  the railroad tracks, then about ½ a mile or so east on Trinity. As you pass the Norwood intersection, you will turn left at the next drive way.  You will enter the building directly in  front  of  you  and  you  will  see  a  stairwell  and  an elevator  directly  in  front  of  you.  Go  up  to  the  second floor. We will meet in room 203. See the map below for directions. We hope to see you in May.
