## Chuck Peddle Remembered

Chuck Peddle, one of the most important engineers of the early home computing era, has died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 82. He's best known as the lead designer  for  MOS  Technology's  6502,  a low-cost processor  (just  $25  in 1975) that found its way into firstwave home computers like the Apple  II  and  Commodore  PET.  Variants of that core design found their way  into  influential  consoles  like the Atari 2600 and NES. If you have nostalgia  for  the  days  when  8-bit computers were cutting edge, you likely  owe  a  debt  of  gratitude  to Peddle.

The  6502  almost  didn't  happen. Peddle wanted to design his more affordable chip at Motorola, which was struggling to sell its 6800 CPU design  kits  for  a  then-costly  $300. When  Motorola  was  unresponsive to the proposal (it saw the proposal as internal  competition),  Peddle and  six  team  members  jumped  to MOS  Technology.  Even  after  the 6502  shipped,  it  was  in  danger  -Motorola sued months later to try and halt sales, forcing MOS to settle in 1976. Commodore swooped in to

buy MOS soon after, making Peddle its chief engineer and changing the computing landscape with the $495 PET.

Peddle left the MOS team in 1980 and worked on lower-key projects like  Sirius  Systems  Technology's Victor PC and removable hard drives  that  were  precursors  to  external  drives  and  USB  sticks.  By then,  though,  his  legacy  was  wellestablished. He helped democratize computing by making home PCs affordable.  And  to  some  extent,  he ushered in the notion of ubiquitous computing, where technology spread  everywhere  instead  of  sitting  in  monolithic  servers.  In  that sense, smartphones and connected homes have roots in the ideas Peddle formulated 45 years ago.

## What About Some Updated Amiga Software

Welcome back! It's a new year, one that makes efficient use of only '2' and '0.' Will the new year be better than the last? It's not exactly looking like it so far, given the national events we already know will be on the way over the coming months. It might  be  a  tall  expectation  in  the Amiga  community  as  well,  seeing how hardware and software developers have given the platform a bit

more of a kick over the last year or two  than  we've  seen  in  a  good while, whether the first appearance of  the  standalone Vampire system or a new release of MorphOS with the potential for an X64 version to come.

It seems people are energized about  the  Amiga  and  its  relatives more than in a long time, almost as if ast  nature  full-force,  and  stopped caring (or at least caring less) about who has a 'true' Amiga and who  doesn't,  whether  68K  legacy or OS4 or Vampire or MorphOS or emulation. Perhaps I'm over-simplifying things and not seeregardless it's the feel I've been getting lately.

the  community  suddenly  embraced  its  retro-hobbyist-enthusiing  the  cracks  in  the  facade,  but

With 2020 being the 35th birthday of the Amiga, or at least the release year of the A1000, I'm hoping to up my  personal  level  of  Amiga-ness this year and pop out a related creative  project  or  two.  I'm  already using  my  Twitter  account  to  post highlights and historical Amiga tidbits, under the hashtag #Amiga35Years  .  The  year  is  just beginning, so I'm in prehistory as of this  writing,  covering the Consumer  Electronics  Show  of  1984  and the Amiga 'Lorraine' prototype shown  there  with  the  first  Boing Ball  demonstration.  Hopefully  12 months is enough to cover most of Amiga history. We shall see.

This month's meeting shall be held at  the  usual  time  and  place,  and  I

hope most of you can make it there. I hope to revisit the subject of Amiga emulation via the Raspberry Pi system. I've run into a few videos online which (I believe) gave me a few insights on what I might have been  doing  wrong  previously,  so hopefully the results will be better this  time,  assuming  I  can  find  the time to do the prep work I need to do.  We  might  even  have  dueling emulations this month, as our Prez might bring in his own Pi system (a partial  hand-me-down)  with  the same goal in mind. Be there or be square!

With  all  this  talk  of  new  developments for old and new Amiga-andrelated  systems,  I  can't  help  but think  how  the  software  side  of things is often neglected. It's understandable, as much in this community  is  done  by  individuals  and small  groups  working  projects  in what available free time they have away from their 'day  job,'  so  new software  tends  to  be  smaller  utilities, relatively easy ports from other systems, with the  occasional 'passion project' thrown in.

There have been a few attempts to update older software-the buyout and updates for Personal Paint come to mind, such as they are. Sadly,  the vast majority of Amiga software, especially in the productivity arena,  falls  under  'abandon-ware', even if we still use it to this day. I'd be ecstatic to see updates of these programs  that  take  advantage  of developments  such  as  advanced graphics, or audio, or the CPU power afforded by a PowerPC or Intel/AMD or Vampire080. Part of the  problem  is  that  rights  to  old software is still held by the rightsholders, be they individuals or software  companies,  either  of  which might  not  be  in  existence  today, and  source  code  for  the  software might no longer be available as well. Pipedream as it may be, I can't help but  wish  for  those  behind  classic Amiga graphic, animation, or audio software  to  release  their  source code, and encourage the community to take the baton and run with it. Imagine  a  new  version  of  Deluxe Paint or MovieSetter running at full speed in HD resolutions.

To give a more specific example, I'd wish for Newtek, who still exists for now, to release the code for the last Amiga version of Lightwave 3D, so it  could  be  ported  to  PowerPC  or another  native  code  for  a  speed boost, use RTG high-resolution screens without using outside mode-promotion  software,  maybe add some openGL display support for something beyond a wireframe preview.  Newtek  might  not  be  interested in doing so, as Lightwave is still active software on other platforms,  though  with  the  revisions they've had over the years, I'd imagine  there's  not  that  much  code  in common  with  version  5  anymore. Still, a person can dream, even pipedream.

With  this  being  the  Amiga's  35th birthday, perhaps we can work that

little bit harder, and those remaining rights-holders and code-hoarders  might  be  that  little  bit  more charitable.  Or  perhaps  I  can  eat  a can  of  beans  and  fly  to  the  moon. Either  way,  SOMETHING  will  happen in 2020, that much is certain.
