## Questionable Decisions

I have some sad news to relay, brought to my attention by Eric Hill of Amigalove.com on the passing of Greg Tibbs.  Veteran  members  may  remember  Greg  from  the  early  days  of  the Dayton group, back when there were the two Amiga groups, AFIT and Amiga-Dayton. He was also a talented hardware engineer whose best-known Amiga  product  was  the  'Rejuvenator' board,  an  expansion  for  Amiga  1000 systems to bring them up to spec with their newer A500 and A2000 contemporaries.  Mr.  Hill  was  working  to  revive this product, and thus was working  to  contact  Greg  previously, which leads us to our current unfortunate news. Greg Tibbs will be missed, and the Amiga community as a whole is diminished by his loss.

As 2020 is the 35th anniversary of the Amiga's  debut  (in  the  form  of  the A1000), I have been motivated to look over  the  Amiga  and  its  history,  and have been posting tidbits roughly chronologically  on  Twitter  under  the #Amiga35Years  hashtag.  I  have  been working  through  it  starting  with  its inception as Jay Miner's dream concept at the start of this year, and as of this writing  I'm  still  only  at  around  1986. Perhaps the density of information will drop somewhat once I get past 1994 or so-only time will tell.

In my reading and research on the Amiga and Commodore's history, you find several  points  where  a  choice  was made  that  affected  all  going  forward, and wonder what might have been if a different path had been taken. People often  talk  about  Commodore's  inept marketing  or  short-sighted  decisionmaking, but there are other more subtle  or  obscure  choices  that  may  have

had just as profound an effect on the Amiga as a whole. Here are but a few.

When the early Amiga team was developing the operating system, along with the  Exec  multitasking  kernel  by  Carl Sassenrath and the Intuition user interface from RJ Mical, there was to be the layer  between  them,  called  CAOS  inhouse, for Commodore Amiga Operating  System,  which  would  handle  the file system, memory usage, and pretty much everything else under the hood. This part was lagging behind the other components, and it was determined it would not be finished  by  the  already overworked programmers in time for the  projected  launch  of  the  Amiga. Even  worse,  the  third-party  commissioned programmers upped their price once they learned the Amiga company had been bought by Commodore, causing  negotiations  to  fall  through.  A  replacement OS component was found in TripOS by Dr. Tim King and MetaComCo,  quickly  rewritten  to  become  the original AmigaDOS 1.x we know today. The downside was TripOS/AmigaDOS lacked the resource tracking facilities of the original CAOS  design specs, which affected the overall stability of the OS. I wonder what might be if CAOS had  gone  forward  instead,  either  by allowing the needed time and delaying the Amiga's release further,  which might  have  given  more  market  share to  competitors  like  the  Atari  ST,  or bringing it in as a replacement to TripOS  ASAP  for  OS  version  1.1  or  1.2. That would presumably break the earliest Amiga software, but hopefully would lead to a stronger and more stable  OS  and  software  base  going  forward.  Maybe  even  stem  the  tide  of Amiga  instability-bashing its detractors liked to harp on. The Amiga's OS was so ahead of its time upon its debut, it's just too unfortunate circumstances prevented it from being that little bit better.

Shortly before parting ways with Commodore after being asked to locate to Pennsylvania from California, Jay Miner was working on designs for the next Amiga  following  the  A1000,  a  set  of specifications, concepts, and prototype boards  code-named  'Ranger.'  These included an enhanced custom chip set with more colors and speed. Based on reports,  the  Ranger  chipset  offered more than the OCS/ECS chips, but not as powerful as the AGA system. A Ranger system would use either a 68010 or 68020 CPU and required  pricey  highspeed Video RAM (not sure if this was for display memory only, like a video card, or shared CHIP RAM like Amigas we know) which is part of why Commodore rejected the design in favor of its own updated design from in-house and the  German  branch,  which  would  become  the  Amiga  500  and  2000.  It's clear  a  'Ranger'  Amiga  would  be  a much bigger leap over the A1000 than the  more  incremental  500  and  2000, but  those  cost-reduced  designs  were Commodore's most successful and best-selling Amiga systems  overallthe  A500  especially-while  a  RangerAmiga  would  almost  undoubtedly  be substantially more expensive than the A500 and have perhaps less  mass-appeal.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Ranger pushed  the  Amiga  chip  set  tech  forward more than Commodore ever did until  the  A1200  and  A4000  in  1992, and  conceivably  could  have  kept  the Amiga  line  ahead  of  the  PC  systems graphically longer than it did, especially  if  that  momentum  was  held.  It's  a hard outcome to predict.

Finally,  there  was  one  big  decision from Commodore's management. Shortly after the release of the Amiga 1000,  former  Pepsi  manager  Thomas Rattigan was installed as Commodore CEO, replacing the lackluster Marshall Smith,  and  inheriting  a  company  that was hemorrhaging money after buying, finishing,  and  launching  Amiga,  along with less well-advised  Commodore products. Having little choice, Rattigan ruthlessly  cut  budgets,  staff,  projects, and  products  to  bring  Commodore back into the black. He also allegedly recommended the Amiga line be split into low and high-end systems, which would  become  the  Amiga  500  and 2000.  He  basically  wrestled  Commodore  into  its  most  successful  period since the height of Jack Tramiel and the C-64, but he wouldn't stick around to see it. Apparently chairman Irving Gould wasn't happy with Rattigan, believing  he  was  being  too  high-profile about his role, so when an outside consultant,  whose  name  happened  to  be Mehdi  Ali,  recommended  firing  Rattigan,  Gould  was  happy  to  do  so,  even though it  resulted  in  a  breach  of  contract  lawsuit.  We  know the rest, with Irving  Gould  and  Mehdi  Ali  presiding over Commodore's slow spiral into the dirt.  It  would  be  interesting  to  know what would have happened if Thomas Rattigan had been allowed to serve out his full five-year contract, or better yet if Irving Gould got  over  whatever weird hate-boner he had for Rattigan and  kept  him  on  for  the  duration. Thomas Rattigan's track record in other businesses shows he was hardly infallible, but his brief tenure at Commodore  was  competent,  fiscally responsible,  and  appeared  to  show  a decent  understanding  of  how  to  sell the Amiga and grow its user base. He also  seemed  to  be  good  at  trimming projects  that  were  superfluous  or  unlikely  to  pan  out.  While  it's  possible nothing might have prevented Commodore or Amiga from falling to Windows PC  dominance  in  the  long  run,  with Rattigan at the helm, it looks like Commodore probably could have held out longer,  and  in  better  overall  shape, wasting  less  money  on  side  projects (wasting less money overall) and focusing harder on what worked. While we can never know exactly what quantum results these alternate,  presumably smarter decisions would  have  produced, we can only assume the world would naturally be a better place if it meant a few more, and more powerful Amigas were in it.

## Raspberry Pi's Need for Speed

Since  we  first  launched  Raspberry  Pi, an  SD  card  (or  microSD  card)  has  always been a vital component. Without an SD card to store the operating system,  Raspberry  Pi  is  pretty  useless! Over the ensuing eight years, SD cards have  become  the  default  removable storage  technology,  used  in  cameras, smartphones,  games  consoles  and  all sorts  of  other  devices.  Prices  have plummeted to the point where smaller size  cards  are  practically  given  away for free, and at the same time storage capacity  has  increased  to  the  point where you can store a terabyte on your thumbnail.

However,  the  fact  that  SD  cards  are now so commonplace sometimes conceals the fact that not all SD cards are created equal. SD cards have a speed rating-how fast you can read or write data  to  the  card-and  as  card  sizes have increased, so have speed ratings. If you want to store 4K video from your digital camera, it is important not just that  the  card  is  big  enough  to  hold  it, but  also  that  you  can  write  it  to  the card fast enough to keep up with the huge amount of data coming out of the camera.

The speed of an SD card will also directly  affect  how  fast  your  Raspberry  Pi runs, in just the same way as the speed of a hard drive affects how fast a conventional desktop computer runs. The faster you can read data from the card, the faster your Raspberry Pi will boot, and the faster programs  will load. Equally,  write  speed  will  also  affect how  well  any  programs  which  save large  quantities  of  data  run-so  it's important to use a good-quality card.

The speed rating of an SD card should be printed either on the card itself or on the packaging.

The 32GB card shown below is Class 4, denoted by the 4 inside  the  letter  C  this indicates that it can write at 4MB/s.

The 64GB card shown below is Class 10, and  so  can  write  at  10MB/s.  It  also shows  the  logo  of  UHS  ('ultra  high speed') Class 1, the 1 inside the letter U,  which  corresponds  to  the  same speed.

![Image](2020-03-NL_artifacts/image_000003_fcff84b00122428f83d51363900ec9c3f9177844a59cf7c2c85449a2a3501fbf.png)

More recently, speeds have started to be quoted in terms of the intended use of the card, with Class V10 denoting a card intended for video at 10MB/s, for example.  But  the  most  recent  speed categorization-and the one most relevant to use in a Raspberry Pi-is the new A (for  'application')  speed  class. We  recommend  the  use  of  Class  A1 cards  (as  the  one  above-see  the  A1 logo  to  the  right  of  the  Class  10  symbol) in Raspberry Pi-in addition to a

## A new tool for testing your SD card speed

We've  all  heard  the  stories  of  people who have bought a large capacity SD card  at  a  too-good-to-be-true  price from  a  dodgy  eBay  seller,  and  found that  their  card  labeled  as  64GB  can only actually hold 2GB of data. But that is at least fairly easy to spot-it's much harder to work out whether your supposedly fast  SD  card  is  actually  meeting its specified speed, and unscrupulous  manufacturers  and  sellers often mislabel low quality cards as having unachievable speeds.

Today, as the first part of a new suite of tests which will enable you to perform various diagnostics on your Raspberry Pi  hardware,  we  are  releasing  a  tool which allows you to test your SD card to check that it performs as it should.

To install the new tool, from a terminal do sudo apt update sudo apt install agnostics

('agnostics'? In this case it's nothing to do with religion! I'll leave you to work out the pun…)

Once  installed,  you  will  find  the  new application 'Raspberry Pi Diagnostics' in the main menu under 'Accessories', and if you launch it, you'll see a screen like this:

![Image](2020-03-NL_artifacts/image_000004_18895ef908ce0eeb9beb36693cd4531f835970c9f3f0de354dcfb30c1553345e.png)

In future, this screen will show a list of the  diagnostic  tests,  and  you  will  be able  to  select  which  you  want  to  run using the checkboxes in the right-hand column. But for now, the only test available is SD Card Speed Test; just press 'Run Tests' to start it.

One thing to note is that the write performance  of  SD  cards  declines  over time. A new card is blank and data can be written to what is effectively 'empty' memory, which is fast; but as a card ing  the  SD  card  while  the  test  is  running,  which  can  affect  the  result-by running the test multiple times we try to reduce the likelihood of a single bad run resulting in a fail.)

If the test result was a pass, great! Your SD card is good enough to provide optimum performance in your Raspberry Pi.  If  it  failed,  have  a  look  in  the  log file-you'll see something like:

fills  up,  memory  needs to  be  erased  before  it can be overwritten, and so  writes  will  become slower the more a card is  used.  The  pass  /  fail criteria  in  this  test  assume a new (or at least freshly formatted) card; don't  be  alarmed  if  the write speed  test fails when  run  on  the  SD card  you've  been  using for six months! If you do

notice your Raspberry Pi slowing down over time, it may be worth backing up your SD card using the SD Card Copier tool and reformatting it.

The test takes a minute or so to run on a  Raspberry  Pi  4  (it'll  take  longer  on older models), and at the end you'll see a results screen with either (hopefully) PASS or (if you are less fortunate) FAIL. To see the detailed results of the speed test, press 'Show Log', which will open the test log file in a text editor. (The log file is also written to your home directory as rpdiags.txt.)

We are testing against the A1 specification, which requires a sequential write speed  of  10MB/s,  500  random  write operations per second, and 1500 random  read  operations  per  second;  we run the test up to three times. (Tests of this nature are liable to errors due to other  background  operations  access-

You  can  see  just  how  your  card  compares to the stated targets; if it is pretty close  to  them,  then  your  card  is  only just  below  specification  and  is  probably  fine  to  use.  But  if  you  are  seeing significantly lower scores than the targets,  you  might  want  to  consider  getting another card.

## Apollo 11 Guidance Computer vs USB-C Chargers

It  comes as no surprise that the guidance computers aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft  were  impossibly  primitive compared to the pocket computers we all carry around 50 years later. But on his  website,  an  Apple  developer  analyzed the tech specs even further and found  that  even  something  as  simple as  a  modern  USB  charger  is  packed with more processing power.

Forrest  Heller,  a  software  developer who  formerly  worked  on  Occipital's Structure 3D scanner accessory for mobile  devices,  but  who  now  works  for Apple, broke down the numbers when

it comes to the processing power, memory,  and  storage  capacity  of  Google's 18W Pixel charger, Huawei's 40W SuperCharge, the Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2 charger, and the Apollo 11 guidance computer, also referred to as the AGC.

:

It's not easy to directly compare those modern devices  with  the  50-year-old AGC, which was custom developed by NASA  for  controlling  and  automating the  guidance  and  navigation  systems aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft. In a time when computers were the size of giant rooms, the AGC was contained in a box just a few feet in length because it was one of the first computers to be made with integrated circuits. Instead of  plopping in an off the shelf processor,  NASA's  engineers  designed  and built the AGC with somewhere around 5,600 electronic gates that were capable of performing nearly 40,000 simple mathematical  calculations  every  second. While we measure processor speeds  in  gigahertz  these  days,  the AGC chugged along at 1.024 MHz.

By comparison, the Anker PowerPort Atom  PD  2  USB-C  charger  includes  a Cypress CYPD4225 processor running at 48 MHz with the twice the RAM of the AGC, and almost twice the storage space for software instructions. There would  be  some  challenges  when  it comes  to  making  all  of  the  software powering  the  Apollo 11 spacecraft work on modern equipment, but on his site, Heller lays out the case for why he believes that just four of Anker's USB chargers could have potentially helped take astronauts to the moon and back.

However, going to space is not exactly a smooth ride. A rocket blasting off the pad is a much different experience to flooring the gas pedal in a finely tuned sports  car.  Astronauts,  and  the  equipment that took them to space, were not only subjected to intense G-forces (Apollo 11's top speed was over 24,000 miles per hour as it orbited the Earth before heading to the moon) but leaving Earth's orbit also exposes them to  radiation  and  other  challenges  not experienced  back  on  the  ground.  In other words, while a modern USB charger might have more processing power than  Apollo  11's  guidance  computers, it's doubtful they could survive that trip.
