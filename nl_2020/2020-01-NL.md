## Peripheral Connections Explained

If  you're not sure of the difference between  USB-C  vs.  Thunderbolt  3, or  between  USB  3.0  vs.  USB  3.2, you're  not  alone.  But  mind  you, that's a small problem to have. Not so long ago, we had to also deal with a  myriad  of  other  peripheral  connections  types,  like  FireWire,  eSATA, and so on.

This post will help you understand the current state of modern connection  standards-namely  USB  and Thunderbolt-so that you can plug one device into another with confidence. There are two things to keep in mind: connection types and connection standards.

## Connection type: How things fit

To connect a device (like a portable drive)  to  a  host  (like  a  computer), you need a cable. Like all cables, it has two ends, which are male connectors or connectors for short. One end goes into a host, and the other goes into the device itself. The hole the cable's end plugs into is a female port or port for short. The configuration  of  a  port  determines  its  type. Each  port  type  has  its  corresponding connector.

## USB-C port type is the new norm

Most modern devices use USB Type-C  (or  USB-C  for  short)  port type. In this case, both ends of the connecting cable are the same: they

## January 2020

are  USB-C  connectors.  It's  super convenient. You don't need to figure out which end of the cable goes into the host and which is for the device. The USB-C port also features reversible  plug  orientation,  meaning  you can plug the cable in with whichever side up or down.

What's  more,  USB-C  also  works  as the power connector for large devices, like a laptop-the machine won't need a dedicated power port anymore-and it can deliver power both  ways.  So,  for  example,  when connecting two smartphones using a  USB-C  cable,  you  can  share  data and power between them.

This convenience is available to the latest  USB  standard  and  Thunderbolt 3, which also uses USB-C port type. In other words, when all of our devices support USB-C, which is the way of the future, there's no need to worry  about  what  cable  to  carry anymore, since there's just one type of cable. Well, almost.

## Port types: Thunderbolt 3 vs. USB-C

All  Thunderbolt  3  ports  work  as  a USB-C port, but not vice versa. As a result, you can plug a USB-C portable drive into a TB3 port, and it will work as intended. However, a TB3only  device,  like  the  Samsung  X5, will not work when plugged into a USB-C  port,  even  though  its  cable fits perfectly. The reason is TB3 has more  requirements.  There's  more to  a  TB3  connection  than  a  USB-C one.

![Image](2020-01-NL_artifacts/image_000002_ffbd3b10e1b22c7a8382c44b46fc6c6c8cdfb45b2ee36e66d6b12a49749152b9.png)

## Dallas

As for the connecting cable, all TB3 cables  work  as  USB-C  cables,  but only high-quality USB-C cables can also work as TB3 ones. "Low quality" ones  might  work  but  at  a  much slower speed or are just unreliable. For this reason, a TB3 cable tends to come  with  the  TB3  symbol,  and that's the only way one can visually distinguish one from a USB-C counterpart.

## Legacy USB port types

Since  there  are  billions  of  existing USB devices on the market, it's essential  to  support  them.  And  as  a result,  for  the  foreseeable  future, chances  are  you'll  run  into  older USB port types. In this case, remember that, now, the connecting cable has two different ends.

## USB Type-A

The  end  that  goes  into  a  host  is called a USB Type-A connector. This connector  and  the  corresponding port type-the USB-A female port-remains the same in all USB standards,  at least for now. However,  there  are  two  USB  Type-A  versions:

- USB Type-A: Used in USB 1.1 to USB 2.0 and supports speeds up to 480 Mbps.
- USB  Type-A  SuperSpeed:  Used in USB 3.x standards-more on this below-and supports speeds up to 10Gbps. It tends to come in blue.

Again, these two types use the same port and work interchangeably (at their  speed).  In  other  words,  USB

Type-A  SuperSpeed  is  backwardcompatible with USB Type-A.

## USB Type-B

This  type  is  the  other  end  of  the cable  that  goes  into  a  device  and where things get complicated. There  are  so  many  variations  of standard USB Type-B. That's not to mention  the  countless  proprietary Type-B designs, of which the most famous  is  the  Apple  Lighting  connector that goes into an iPhone.

Each variant of Type-B connectors requires a corresponding port of its own.  Physically,  one  variant's  connector won't fit into another's port. As a result, each port type requires a distinctive cable. So, for example, if  you have an iPhone and another non-Apple device, you'll have to carry at least two cables.

Following  are  some,  out  of  many, Type-B standards:

- Standard-B  (or  Type-B):  Used in  USB  1.1  and  USB  2.0  standards.  It  suits  mostly  large  devices, like printers or scanners.
- Standard-B  SuperSpeed:  Available only to USB 3.x device, this port  type  works  best  for  large desktop external storage devices.
- Mini-USB  (or  Mini-B):  Significantly smaller than Type-B, this standard is for old portable devices,  such  as  clamshell  phone, first-gen portable drive. It's mostly obsolete now.
- Micro-USB (or Micro-B): Slightly  smaller  than  Mini-USB,  this port was one the go-to type for older generations of smartphones and tablets. It's also being phased out.
- Micro-USB SuperSpeed: The thin  version  of  the  Standard-B SuperSpeed. It's popular in the portable hard drive drives, like the WD My Passport.

Again, as you can imagine, with so many port  types,  finding  the  right cable for your device can be a pain in the rear, especially when you're in  a  hurry.  This  problem  is  why USB-C  is  such  a  knight  in  shining armor.

## Legacy Thunderbolt port type

Even  though  much  younger  and more  "modern,"  Thunderbolt  has port issues of its own. Before Thunderbolt 3, there were Thunderbolt and  Thunderbolt  2,  which  use  the Mini-Display  port  type.  That  plus the  fact  there  aren't  many  "legacy" Thunderbolt  devices-the  connection was once available exclusively to Apple's ecosystem-Thunderbolt  3  generally  doesn't  support Thunderbolt 2 and Thunderbolt devices. Some can work via an adapter, but in most cases, they don't work well.

## The takeaway

USB Type-C is a new port type that aims to replace all  other  USB  port types, giving  users  one  unifying port  standard  or  all  peripheral  devices.

The fact that Thunderbolt 3 also uses this port means, going forward, it will  be  the  prominent  type.  So  far, it's the only USB port that can work all  existing  USB  standards  (except for the ancient USB 1.x), and chances  are  it  will  also  support  future connection standards.

By  the  way,  all  USB-C  devices  can connect to a USB Type-A port via an adapter or a Type-A to Type-C cable. So going USB-C allows you to get the best of both worlds, the out-of-thebox convenience with modern equipment  and  the  compatibility with legacy devices when need be.

## Connection  standards:  How  fast things connect

The connection standard determines how fast a connection is and what you can do with it. For example, the USB 2.0 standard allows for a  connection  speed  of  up  to  480 Mbps,  and  you  can  also  use  it  to charge a connected device. It's quite straight  forward  if  the  USB  Implementers  Forum  could  make  up  its mind on a simple issue that is how to  call  a  USB  revision.  (Hint:  Don't count on it!)

## USB standards

Due  to  multiple  name  changes  of the third USB generation, USB standards  can  be  confusing.  Currently, there are the following:

- USB 3.2 Gen 2.2: Formerly USB 3.2,  and  is  the  upcoming  USB standard. Cap speed: 20Gbps.
- USB  3.2  Gen  2:  Formerly  USB 3.1 Gen 2, which was also called USB 3.1 at one point. Cap speed: 10Gbps.
- USB  3.2  Gen  1:  Formerly  USB 3.1 Gen 1, which was also called USB 3.0 at one point. Cap speed: 5Gbps
- USB  2.0:  Older  standard  that's still  quite  popular.  Cap  speed: 480 Mbps.
- USB 1.1: An old standard that's now  obsolete.  Cap  speed:  12 Mbps.

To recap, so far, we've had USB 1.1, then USB 2.0, then USB 3.2-(don't think about 3.0 or 3.1 and you'll be less  confused)-which  has  three variations,  including  Gen  1,  Gen  2, and Gen 2◊2. There will be USB 4 at some point though it could also be called USB 4.x or something else entirely.

Generally, USB can also deliver power  to  a  connected  device.  For  this reason,  most,  if  not  all,  portable drives don't require a separate power adapter; they draw juice from the host. Via special software or driver, USB can also deliver sound and vid- eo signals but only at modest levels of qualities.

## Thunderbolt standards

Relatively  young,  Thunderbolt  has been through three revisions.

- Original Thunderbolt: This standard uses the Mini DisplayPort port type and has the cap speed of 10Gbps.
- Thunderbolt 2: It also uses Mini DisplayPort  and  has  the  cap speed of   20Gbps.
- Thunderbolt 3: Uses USB-C port type. Cap speed: 40 Gbps.

Thunderbolt can do a lot more than USB. Among other things, it can deliver  ultra  Hi-Def  video/audio  signals together with high-speed data signals,  and  also  works  as  a  high wattage  power  delivery.  You  can also daisy-chain up to 7 devices together without signal degradation.

By  the  way,  currently,  a  Thunderbolt 3 port supports USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) speed. But when USB 3.2 Gen  2◊2  (20  Gbps)  is  available,  it likely will also  be  implemented within Thunderbolt 3. Future Thunderbolt generations will likely continue to use USB-C port type.

## Conclusion

With  lots  of  capabilities,  the  Thunderbolt 3 is a standard designed to replace  all  other  wired  peripheral connections,  including  HDMI,  and, maybe, even USB. But it's expensive and  a  bit  complicated  in  licensing for  hardware  vendors  to  support. For this reason, USB has been winning and will continue to prevail in a popularity contest. My guess is, at some  point,  Thunderbolt  and  USB will  converge,  as  they  should.  But before  then,  the  USB-C  port  type has already had enough reasons to reign Supreme.

## Javascript: Service  Worker Downsides

One of my interests with JavaScript is how knowing just a little can empower  end-users.  (E.g.  useful  one liner  bookmarklets.)  It  was  one  of the JavaScript Meetup talks that informed  me  that  service  workers even  exist,  and  what  their  use  is. However,  as  an  end  user,  I've  noticed several downsides of them in Chrome.

Today I opened the Chrome browser,  and  noticed  once  again  I  got  a desktop notification ad from a vitamin company I ordered something from once. This ad was starting to pop  up  every  time  I  opened  my browser despite running an  ad blocker.  Not  only  that,  I  consider desktop notification ads to be even more annoying. So I went into the developer  tools,  and  unregistered that service worker, and a bunch of others from sites I almost never visit,  and  don't  want  offline  content from. I used Process Hacker to note that Chrome memory usage dropped from about 2.5Gb to 1.1Gb, and with each service worker I deleted,  one  Chrome  process  thread went  away.  Some  sites  like  AliExpress had a service worker for each store  I'd  visited  in  that  site!  After restarting the browser, that annoying  ad  was  gone!  (I  also  blocked JavaScript  on  that  vitamin  site,  as there seems to be no other way to block a service worker in Chrome.)

https://www.ghacks.net/2016/03 /02/manage-service-workers-infirefox-and-chrome/

Firefox gives the end user more control over service workers.

I  conclude  these  are  getting  to  be like spyware, causing browser bloat leading to system bloat. Since closing a tab to a site does not stop the service  worker  thread,  all  service workers ever loaded are loaded every  time  you  start  the  browser! Imagine  if  a  hundred  websites  installed service workers. It might be worse than trying to load 100 tabs every time you start the browser. It reminds me of all the processes that slow down system startups so that every program you install can have its own updater.

I think sites should ask for end user approval to install a service worker, and explain the pros and cons. If a site  is  rarely  used,  the  cache  may not actually be of value to the end user,  and  as  more  and  more  sites use them browser bloat could get to be  a  bigger  problem.  (My  system with 16Gb of ram has been warning me  to  close  programs  as  I'm  running  out.  Now  I  know  one  reason why! I'll have to see if this helps my Chromebook  as  well!)  I  imagine some  less  respectable  sites  could even  install  multiple  cyrptocurrency  miners  further  bogging  down popular browsers. Even worse, sites  could  hijack  your  bandwidth for a geoblocker, spam engine, botnet  or  vpn.  The  malware  implications  are  scary!  End  user  impact could  be  far  worse  than  cookie abuse!

I  don't  really  know  enough  about this to do a real presentation, but I think  this  would  be  an  interesting discussion  topic  for  our  group.  I'd be willing to tell the story I've basically  outlined  here,  and  would  be interested in expert opinions. Does anyone know if one could add service worker blocking to an ad blocker? (Google didn't seem to find that answer for me.)

## Remembering The CD-32

The end of the year, not to mention the decade, is running up fast. During  this  concluding  year-actually around  the  end  of  2018-I  began using Twitter, despite my  resistance thanks to certain powerful individuals using it like a weaponized sewage pile. I discovered that, like most  'social  media'  outlets,  what you get  out  of  it  and  whether  you enjoy it or not depends on how you decide to use it. I use it to post news and  information  about  my  work and  business,  along  with  the  occasional bit of fun.

As  2019  was  the  35th  anniversary of  the  Transformers  toy  brand,  I was tweeting out various historical Transformer tidbits over the course of  the  year  for  my  followers.  With this year ending, I finish up my formal Transformers coverage in favor of something else. 2020 is the 35th anniversary of the debut of the original Amiga 1000, so expect the year to  be  filled  with  historical  Amiga tweets.

I also have one or two other Amigarelated ideas for the coming year. It seems  I've  been  energized  some- what by the anniversary year along with the up-tick in community energy recently, both in the areas of retro  stuff  and  newer  hardware  and software development. I hope it all proves interesting, at the very least.

With the holiday season, one might think back on gifts and games, and of course, the most desirable video game console of the 1990s, the Sony-  I  mean  the  Amiga  CD-32.  I've mentioned previously that it actually sold quite well in various European  markets  during  its  short  life, though not enough to stop Commodore  from  sinking,  and  almost  certainly not enough to stop the Playstation juggernaut had it been able to compete directly. The CD-32 had  a  lot  of  games,  though  many were  direct  copies  of  Amiga  1200, or  even  500,  games.  If  you  were lucky,  a  game  may  have  gotten some simple console enhancements, like making use of the extra buttons on  the  controller,  a  higher-quality CD soundtrack, or a fancy animated intro  that  wouldn't  fit  on  a  floppy disc. A luckier few actually received extra content, such as more maps or levels. Games with sprawling worlds, like adventures or role-playing frequently fared best, and their style of play was best suited to larger  storage  formats  like  CD,  and  offered more content than floppy-based versionsbigger maps or voice tracks instead of text, for two examples.

The CD-32 is sought after by retro collectors, as its versions of games

were often the best one, (or at least rarely  worse)  if  only  because  they usually came on a single CD instead of a small stack of corruptible floppies.  It  was  also  expandable,  with either  a  MPEG  full-motion  video add-on,  or  an  expansion  (a  classic one like the SX1, or the recent TerribleFire boards) to add the missing bits  to  make  it  a  full  computer.  If there was one thing I wish the CD32 offered in its stock configuration, it  would  be  an  RGB  video  output like all regular Amigas, but as it was intended  to  be  a  TV-based  game console  ,  S-video  wasn't  a  terrible trade-off, and there remains the expansion option. I'll be bringing my CD-32 to this month's holiday meeting, for fun, and to show off a method of connecting an Amiga to an HD television via component inputs, thanks to the RetroTINK RGB2COMP transcoder. It has definite plusses and minuses, which I'll be happy to discuss at the meeting. Hopefully your holiday will be merry and bright, and the coming year will be worth the wait, for your Amiga systems and you as well.
