## Planning a Meeting

Welcome  to  our  brand  new  plague world, ladies and gentlemen. This is an unusual time for us all, so of course it affects  our  little  group.  Dayton-area libraries have canceled events and use of the group meeting rooms, including our group, so this month's library reservation has been cancelled. The Prez and I considered our options, and this month's AmiTech meeting will be held at  Prez  Mike Barclay's apartment. (directions can be found elsewhere in this newsletter).  Obviously  it's  up  to  you whether you wish to attend this relocated meeting or not, as any gathering in this pandemic climate is a risk, however  small,  but  at  least  we  will  offer you  the  opportunity  to  meet  an  AmiTech canine member-at-large, and pet of the Editor, Duke. You might even get a glimpse  of  the  President's  cat  if you're  lucky.  We'll  try  to  organize  a food SIG for the meeting as well, though  exactly  what  will  be  done  is uncertain at the moment, given limitations placed on restaurants and other establishments.  Stay  strong  and  stay safe everyone. We'll get through this.

Until  the  worst  threat  passes  we  can only look on the bright side-at least a pandemic  makes  the  prospect  of  the upcoming election seem a tiny bit less horrifying.

Regarding some of the things I've been looking  at  for  demonstration  at  the meeting, I've been playing around with the Amiga Kickstart ROMs in a few different ways. At the last meeting I was having  some  issues  running  OS  3.9 with  my  Raspberry  Pi  Amiga  emulation. The OS would run, but it was apparent the Kickstart was not patching properly  at  boot,  and  staying  at  version  3.1.  This  gave  me  the  idea  (or quest) to produce a complete 3.9 kick-

start ROM file for emulation purposes. I didn't easily find any legally-dubious kick ROM files online, but did find Amiga utilities ROMSplit and Remus:

http://www.doobreynet.co.uk/beta/i ndex.html.  These  programs  run  on Amiga  OS  3.0  and  above  with  MUI. ROMSplit is used, as the name suggests, to  split  a  Kickstart  ROM  file  into  its component parts, and Remus is used to take those components and build your own customized ROM from them. Obviously you can't just randomly toss any pieces  together  and  expect  them  to work,  so  be  sure  to  consult  the  documentation.  Anyway,  with  these  programs  it  is  possible  to  construct  a complete Kickstart ROM file for OS 3.9, or 3.9 with 'Boing Bag' applied, and use that  for  your  emulator.  You  can  even produce files that can be used with an EPROM  burner,  if  you  want  actual chips for your real Amiga. I'm still in an early  phase,  but  I  hope  to  be  able  to show off a full 3.9 emulated Amiga on Raspberry Pi at our meeting.

With the little bit of understanding that came  with  my  Kick-ROM  tinkering,  I have  improved  another  Amiga  system's usefulness a bit. My Amiga 4000T has  a  Deneb  card  which  gives  it  USB support, but that card also contains a flash  ROM  which  affects  the  boot  sequence,  for  example  enabling  USB  libraries  before  the  OS  is  completely loaded. It can also add Kickstart modules,  effectively  upgrading  your  ROM without the patched double-boot a normal OS 3.9 system normally uses. I had thought about this for a long time, but didn't have the drive or knowledge to do  so  effectively,  but  with  my  recent forays  into  ROM  patching  for  emulation, I decided to take a new crack at it. Using the program Luciferin to modify the contents of the Deneb Flash ROM, I added  the  ROM  modules  from  3.9 much as I would when building a custom ROM in Remus. Apparently I was

successful,  as  the  4000  system  now boots from cold straight into OS 3.9, no longer requiring a reboot as part of the process.

Best of health and best of luck to you all,  I  hope  to  see  you  at  the  meeting. (Though  if  you  have  the  coronavirus, perhaps  you  should  stay  home.)  Assuming we haven't fallen to a viral zombie apocalypse by next month, I'll tell you the tale of my tablet trials, so stay tuned!
