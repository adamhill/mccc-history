## The MCCC News

## Tablet Support &amp; Obsolescence

I t's strange to think that this year, our second under the boot of the pandemic, is getting close to finished. We only have the month of December and its associated holidays yet to go.

There is some Amiga news out there, which hopefully our president will cover. I'll mention some of the more esoteric things. The 2021 Amiga Art (and other things) contest, hosted by Doug of 10 minute Amiga Retro Cast and Pixel Vixen, was set to stream live on YouTube on Saturday the 13th, but live-stream issues forced the live broadcast to be cancelled, which should hopefully have a re-scheduled or prerecorded broadcast out to the masses by the time you read this. (UPDATE: it was posted in a pre-recorded form. Link can be found below.)

In more esoteric news, a new extended OS/Kickstart ROM for Commodore CDTV has been made availableversion 2.35. This update fixes a number of long-standing bugs, and makes life easier for those with expanded or accelerated CDTV systems, and improves compatibility with bootable CD-ROMs, not only those built with the CDTV in mind. For more info, you can check out https://cdtvland.com/ os235/ .

I will finish off this month's column with a somewhat unrelated rant. Recently I went shopping for a new protective case for my Samsung tablet. The case I was using had worn out, the surfacing was peeling off and structural parts of it were breaking down. I

took that as an indication the case was doing the job it was designed to doabsorbing the damage that otherwise would go to the tablet itself. I've gone through the repair process on two different tablets, so I know they don't take case-free shocks and drops anywhere near as well as the manufacturers would want you to believe.

Anyway, I was in the market for a new case. The problem was that market wasn't all that friendly any more toward my old tablet from the distant past year of 2019. (the 'before time') I was pretty happy with the case I had, a little faux-leather jobby which also acted as a cover and stand for the device, with a little cover for the pen mounted on the back, holding it all shut using magnets. As I was quite satisfied with that, naturally I looked to find the same style case by the same manufacturer. I seemed to be out of luck, however, with 'my' case out of stock everywhere I looked, including the manufacturer's own website. They offered a less ideal case model for my tablet, but supplies were limited there too, and it was only available in turquoise and light pink.

I decided to widen my search, but even Ebay wasn't that helpful for finding exactly what I needed. It didn't help that my tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, actually has two different models with two different form factors under the same designation-mine, and a later 'lite' model that's different is several ways, thus needing its own bespoke case. While I was able to find a number of cases to fit my tablet, it was much harder to find one that worked similarly to the case I had been using.

I am still surprised by the number of cases/covers available that use osten- sibly strong magnets as their only form of attachment to the tablet itself. I would never fully trust something that worked like that, especially not after looking over cases like that at a Best Buy a few years back, and confirming that all it took to remove the tablet from its magnetic anchoring was a moderately vigorous shakeyou know, the kind of shaking that is less severe than things like short falls or drops, or catching the device by its cover. It doesn't help that these hitech, not-so-protective magnetic cases are usually much more expensive than a simple one that actually does its job.

I wasn't able to find a duplicate of my previous case, but it did find one by a different manufacturer that was almost functionally the same, save for the 'stops' of the stand being frictionbased rather than magnetic, but I can live with that. Even so, stocks and colors were still limited. Standard colors like black or gray or brown were unavailable, but bright purple, or a mottled pink color was in stock (pink is always available). I was fortunate enough to score a case in navy blue, which wasn't ideal, but quite acceptable.

I do worry for the future, however. I've replaced my case a couple times over the years. It wasn't very difficult finding what I wanted a year and a half ago, but as the two-year-old tablet falls into planned obsolescence, all the accessory manufacturers seem to move along to the next thing too. Even though the tablet itself is perfectly functional, it becomes harder and harder to find replacement cases and other accessories, leaving one to deal with a cover getting progressively more beat up, like a tattered suit, and little to no means to replace it. Either that, or buy the new latest and greatest device that the accessory makers are currently supporting, this year at least,

It makes me think of the contrast with the support communities for our Amigas, as well as other 'retro' computers and game consoles. We have these thirty to forty year old pieces of hardware, and yet there are people with interest and passion to produce new expansions and accelerators, means to use the old hardware in concert with new modern LCD displays, or solidstate storage devices in place of floppy or hard disks. You can get replacement plastic cases, keyboards, and even fitted dust covers to protect it all. I can't help but wonder if anyone in the future will bother with a thirty year old iPhone or Android tablet with the level of interest shown to a classic Apple II computer or Amiga today.
