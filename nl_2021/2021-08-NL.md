## PiStorm: Keeping the Amiga Alive

I n the last issue of Custom PC magazine, Gareth Halfacree checked out an Amiga fan's open hardware build: 'PiStorm'. Let's see why he thought it stood out from the crowd…

Officially, the Commodore Amiga died in 1996, 11 years after Commodore brought the innovative machines to market with the Amiga 1000. In reality, there are people out there from whom you will never take their Amigas - even if the legal rights surrounding the trademarks, technology, hardware, software and so on are increasingly muddied in the face of competing legal claims.

It's this band of enthusiasts that's keeping the Amiga alive with new hardware, typically designed to bridge the gap between classic and modern computing. The most popular of these are accelerators, designed to increase a stock Amiga 1000 or 500 from its aging 7MHz Motorola 68000 to a system that's a little faster.

The PiStorm, designed by Amiga fan Claude Schwarz, is just one of them, but one that stands out from the crowd for a variety of reasons. The first is its open hardware; Schwarz doesn't sell the PiStorm, but instead publishes the

source code and design files for anyone to submit to a PCB fabricator. If you don't fancy fighting with minimum order quantities, the community around the PiStorm organises semiregular group buys, in which an assembled board, requiring only the headers to be soldered in place, can cost as little as $13 US (around £9 ex VAT).

In a market where your average Amiga accelerator costs 5-15 times as much money, an accelerator for that little would be remarkable, but the PiStorm is far from a simple accelerator. The board itself is simple, driven by an Intel Altera MAX II complex programmable logic device (CPLD) - akin to a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), but simpler and cheaper.

![Image](2021-08-NL_artifacts/image_000002_5b9567cc280bef926715d16e6598e75b2f2b3e689b8314e2d688d57d45d04040.png)

The PiStorm nestles in an Amiga's CPU socket, with the stock processor removed.

The CPLD acts as 'glue logic' between the host Amiga and a Raspberry Pi single-board computer in an unusual fashion. Connected via the Raspberry Pi's 40-pin general-purpose input/output (GPIO) header, the PiStorm allows the Amiga to treat the Raspberry Pi as a replacement processor and more.

Installation is simple - remove the processor from your Amiga 1000, 500

or 500 Plus, and push the PiStorm into its place. Add the Raspberry Pi on top, with a micro-SD card loaded with the lightweight Linux distribution of your choice, and you're done.

The software side is a little trickier. PiStorm is a constantly evolving project, and there's no ready-to-run software image. The documentation walks you through downloading and compiling the software, updating the CPLD and finally loading the Muhashi emulator. It's here that the PiStorm cuts its costs - rather than having a real processor or an FPGA loaded with a soft core, the PiStorm connects the Amiga to a software emulator.

A Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ connects to the PiStorm via its GPIO header.

This unusual blend of real and emulated hardware unlocks additional features too. By default, the PiStorm is configured to act as a Motorola 68020 and a 128MB chip memory expansion. Tweak the configuration and you can increase that to a Motorola 68040 - albeit with a few compatibility issues that are still being worked on with 8MB of additional Zorro II memory - just about the most you could ever fit in a classic Amiga.

Handling the CPU and RAM is just the beginning though. The PiStorm's keyboard and mouse pass-through also allow you to connect USB peripherals to the Raspberry Pi and have them control the Amiga. Meanwhile, a network pass-through, which will allow the Amiga to use the Raspberry Pi's Wi-Fi connection, is on the road map.

The PiStorm can also turn hard drive images, or physical block devices, into SCSI Amiga drives, making it easy to expand your Amiga's storage. The board acts as a real-time clock as well, setting the Amiga's clock to the Raspberry Pi's clock - which is, in turn, set automatically over the network via NTP.

The board isn't finished there either. The PiStorm can also emulate a retargetable graphics (RTG) card, a common form of add-in card that gives an Amiga high-resolution and highcolour-depth capabilities. Better still, when configured as an RTG - a task that requires adjusting the configuration on both the Raspberry Pi and the Amiga itself - the video is output from the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port, making it easy to connect your Amiga to modern monitors and TVs.

In short, the PiStorm is remarkable. It's not perfect - the ability to boot from physical Kickstart ROMs didn't work during testing, for example, with the PiStorm failing unless a ROM dump file was provided, and when the Amiga is powered off, the Raspberry Pi loses power without shutting down safely. Also, among other compatibility issues, it's currently limited to the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+, with Raspberry Pi 4 and Compute Module 4 support in progress, but for the money there's still nothing else like it.

## Computer Growth in Different Parts of the World

T he years always seem to go by faster with each one that passes. We're already halfway through this one, even though we spent a lot of that time either staying home or looking at each other over our masks. Regardless, we've been doing our meetings at the alternative location of Prez. Mike Barclay's home for over a year now, and with the world, or at least the local area opening up again, we'll be looking into the possibility of meeting at the library once again, and with a little luck we will be returning to that location, possibly as early as next month. Until then, this meeting will be at the current 'usual place.' For a fun little incentive, everyone who attends this month's meeting in person will receive a gift. I won't go into detail about this gift except to say it is Amiga-related, so be there if you want to find out!

Most of us in the group are on the older side. I'm one of the younger AmiTech members, and I'll be turning fifty later this year. Something of which I've become aware is that I am roughly the same age of the entire commercial video game industry, if not slightly older. The first arcade video game, 'Computer Space' coming out in late 1971, and the first successful arcade game, 'Pong,' in 1972. The first home console, the original Magnavox Odyssey, released the same year.

While different computers were around in various forms, from the big mainframe to the hobbyist kit box, al- most since WW2, they weren't really much of a consumer item until 1977, and the 'big three' of the Apple II, the TRS-80, and the Commodore PET, followed up later by low-cost systems by Atari, Commodore, Texas Instruments, and others.

With the mid-to-late 1980s, the shift went to the 16-bit systems, like the Macintosh, Atari ST, and our beloved Amiga, while the seeds were being sown for Microsoft and the Intel PC standard to steamroll the world, at least until we moved much of our lives over from our desktop computers to our phones and mobile devices over the course of the 2000s thru the 2020s.

Another thing that I've become more aware of is how different parts of the world handled computers and video games in their own little insular ways, even if many would eventually end up in roughly the same place in the present. Most of us are somewhat familiar our own market in the US, getting its start around 1977, with the 'big 3' computers from Apple, Radio Shack, and Commodore, along with the Atari VCS/2600 as the successful standard-setting video game console.

While newer and more powerful video game systems would debut, the 2600 would remain dominant, even against its own successor from Atari itself. Computers would court the mass market with less expensive systems, with Commodore leading the way and burning the bridges with the inexpensive VIC-20 and C64. Around 1983, there was the video game industry crash, a phenomenon almost completely within the US, thanks to a flood of speculative game companies over-burdening the market with cheap crap, and then burying it under their corpses. Home computers survived, despite being as much gaming machines as work systems, but the crash did create a stigma around gaming. Marketing for computers often downplayed their gaming abilities, or at least played up that a child could use it to do their homework, whether they ever actually did or not.

It wasn't until the mideighties that the game console made a comeback, thanks to Nintendo, ushering in a Japanese domination of the video game console industry, despite others' attempts to break in, or get back in, in Atari's case. Even so, Nintendo fiddled with various accessories at launch to give the impression of more value than 'just a video game console.'

The PCs and Windows slowly developed a strangle hold on the computer industry, thanks to being a loose standard which advanced through the efforts of many different hardware and software manufacturers, bringing us to where we are today, more or less, with our laptops and our phones, and our retro stuff no one understands but us.

It seems that other markets benefited to an extent from getting a slightly later start than the US computer and games market, and avoiding or learning from our mistakes. Japan enjoyed its video games, but home consoles didn't take off quite the same way. There were computers from Sharp, Fujitsu, and others, most of which would never be seen outside the island. Many used more high-resolution displays than western counterparts, thanks to the demands of showing complex Japanese Kanji text. Several Japanese manufacturers, together with Microsoft (!!) birthed the MSX computer standard, roughly comparable, but not compatible, with the TI-994A computer or the Colecovision game console. It became a favored system for home gaming, at least until Nintendo introduced its Famicom game system, which would become known in other lands as the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES. The Famicom would kick the Japanese game console industry into high gear, and enable it to spread over the rest of the world a few years later.

Meanwhile, their home computers largely stayed Japanese-only, even extremely powerful systems like Sharp's X68000 series. Perhaps it was an issue of language and writing, or the tendency of the nation to keep to itself in many areas, which has made it difficult for many companies to find a foothold there. Either way, Japan's game systems grabbed the world as the PC standard slowly supplanted many of their home-grown computer standards.

Many European nations had their own paths in the world of computers and gaming, but I shall focus on the United Kingdom, as it's the only one I know barely anything about. Where Atari might have stormed the US, and Nintendo stormed both US and Japan years later, neither made a very strong impact in the UK. Sega's Master system and Mega Drive/Genesis apparently had a stronger presence, at least until the Super Nintendo came out.

Unlike the US, the UK market made little distinction between a 'game machine' and a 'home computer,' and a game from a tape cassette on a computer was just as valid as a cartridge in a console - perhaps more so, as the game on tape was likely to be cheaper. Inexpensive options seemed to be the popular ones, with the Sinclair ZX-80/81 and Spectrum being extremely popular, followed up by Acorn/BBC, Amstrad, and Commodore. The UK and Europe especially seemed to embrace the 'bedroom coder' paradigm, with young folks buying, playing (and pirating) games, then trying their hand at programming one of their own, some growing quite big from there.

I've heard the idea posited that the UK computer market ran a few years behind the US. Giving an example, the computer market in the US was run by

the 8-bit systems by Apple, Atari, Commodore, and more until the mid to late eighties, when the 16-bit systems like Mac and Amiga took over, with the Windows PC asserting dominance in the nineties. By contrast, the UKwas ruled by the 8-bits from Commodore, Sinclair, Amstrad, and more thru the eighties into the nineties, when the Atari ST and Amiga began to have greater influence.

Then DOOM came out on the PC and it was all over for everyone soon after.

As we all got closer to today, the three markets start to look more alike. The US, UK, and Japan all futz around on their Windows PCs and smartphones from Apple and Android. They play games on their Playstations and Nintendo Switch systems, though Microsoft's X-box has a bit smaller foothold in Japan than elsewhere. Still, it's interesting to look at tech history and think how the world we have today started out in several completely different places. It's almost too bad that divergence couldn't stay, as maybe then we could've seen some part of the world where the Amiga kept its strong influence. Dare to dream.
