## They're Coming

## New Amigas on the way

Welcome to another month. As the holiday season approaches, it seems more and more that the next generation of technology may well be our Christmas gift. The release version 1.0 of Morph OS should be in beta testing as you read this, and it will also be possible to buy a PegasOS board or system without having to sign a NDA. It seems Bplan and Thendic and the MorphOS people are well on their way to bringing us their vision of what the Amiga's future. Supposedly Hyperion, Eyetech, and Amiga Inc. are on a similar schedule to bring us the 'official' next-gen Amiga, in the form of the Amiga One with OS 4.0. It's harder to say exactly how far along they are, but it's obviously in their best interest to not be left behind by the Morph-based machines. Of course, it's also in their best interest to deliver a stable product, because shipping a rushed, buggy product is a great way to send your customers flocking to the competition, assuming they can do better of course. In any case, I'd imagine that while one of these two PPC-based Amiga (or Amiga-compatible) solutions will probably beat the other to the marketplace, it won't take long until both are there.

Regardless of who gets there first, The system and OS has to attract its customers. Quality, capability, available software, look and feel all come into play to determine which system people will want to buy, if any. From an outsider's relatively uninformed perspective (my own), MorphOS seems to have the better foundation, while AmigaOS4 has the prettier facade, and either approach could draw consumers to their side. I'll have to see, touch, taste, whatever both options to see which one works best for me. One last issue seems to be the one of locking the software to the hardware. AmigaOS4 is supposedly geared to run only on hardware with a hard-coded -urn- code, so the software can identify what it's running on, while Morph does not appear to be restricted in such a way. In short, this means OS4 only runs on the Amiga One (and maybe the Cyberstorm/Blizzard cards in Amigas), but not PegasOS, while it has been shown that running MorphOS on either PegasOS or AmigaOne would be a trivial matter. I can (vaguely) understand Amiga's intentions in this, but I would also expect them to reverse their position in an instant if it costs them too many sales. I also wouldn't be at all surprised to see one or both systems gain software compatibility for each other, enabling OS4 software to run on Morph, and vice-versa. There are undoubtedly legal issues to deal with there, but it's been shown possible in the past to run software designed for one PPC kernel on another, so someone's got to be thinking about gaining better marketshare by running the widest array of software. This can apply on the hardware level too, and whatever hardware handles your choice of operating system is worth a second look for many con-

sumers, especially with this tiny market as fragmented as it is. I don't know which system I want right now, but if my choice serves me well for anywhere near as long as my A4000T, I'll be pleased.

## Fleamarket My thoughts

Well, it's over for another year. I'm sure we'll have more to report in next month's newsletter, but I thought I'd share my thoughts.

The fleamarket had far less to sell than ever before. And I counted fewer than 20 attendees. Speaking for myself, I think we may have reached the limit on how many times we can pass the same hardware and software back and forth among ourselves.

This was a far cry from our earlier MetCom's. We started the MetCom tradition in 1987. In years past, the fleamarket was just a part of the show - and a small part at that. In fact, the first one or two MetCom's didn't include a fleamarket at all.

Things I remember:

-   flying in guest speakers to

give talks

-   holding multiple simultaneous classes throughout the entire day
-   renting a large part of the Arlington Convention Center for the show
-   over 10,000 square feet of display space
-   attendance by 12 or more dealers and developers
-   hundreds of attendees
-   lines of 50 people or more waiting to get in as soon as the doors opened
-   shows that ran from 10am to 5pm - and still didn't allow enough time to folks to do and see what they wanted to

Those earlier shows were a lot more work to organize, but they were a lot more fun as well. We dropped the

MetCom designation in 1997, when it became apparent that we didn't have much more to do other than the fleamarket. Our list of dealers and developers had dwindled and there wasn't a lot of interest in classes any more.

Since 1997 we've had fleamarkets. Still, the fleamarkets have been very successful. When there's a lot to sell and a lot of folks attending, it's still fun. But it seems that the attendance and the amount of things for sale drops annually. I think it's a reflection of what's happened in the Amiga market during those same years. (What Amiga market?)

Obviously what we need are new computers and new software to run on them. More than that, we need

new Amiga users. If the new computers do nothing more than sell to existing Amiga owners, next year there will be 10 of us at the Fleamarket. Here's hoping that the new machines can spark new interest so that our club can grow again.
