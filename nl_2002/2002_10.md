Demos And Stuff We had hoped that the new AmigaOne would have shipped by the show date, but unfortunately this does not look too likely at this time. So come and see some of your favorite Amiga classic machines set up and running.

We are always looking for interesting things to offer and demo, so if you have any thoughts as to something that you would like to see at the show please contact our Educational Chair, David Owens.

Other Attractions We will have a door prize drawing at the end of the show, and you need to be present to win. Amiga software from the club's library of public domain software will be available. A special on memberships will be offered: thirteen months for the price of twelve. We also hope to have a few computers set up so you can ask the club's resident gurus for help and advice.

## Amiga Update

## The latest from Amiga

September 5, 2002 I would first like to thank all of those that I had the chance to meet in Sacramento. While a short trip it was indeed great fun and real delight meeting with all of you and hearing not only the encouraging words, but also sharing in your concerns, desires, and dreams. We are looking forward to deliver on what we discussed with you.

When we purchased Amiga from Gateway there were many out there who said that we would fail. There were many out there who have worked against our efforts, and others that have misrepresented fact and manipulated privileged information in order to further their obviously self serving goals. There have been those who have wronged us, and caused us damage.

But, guess what? We are still here! We are still delivering! We are going to stay here! Amiga is about people, technology, excellence, we are a most tenacious people, and we have the community to prove it. Has it always gone according to plan? no. Have we made some adjustments to the plan? yes. Are we delivering on the plan? yes. Will we allow others to dictate our future? Absolutely not. Period..

Because of you, the Amiga dream lives, because of
