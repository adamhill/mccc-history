## Amiga Users Will we ever be satisfied?

I've thought a bit about the world of Amiga, and noticed a parallel with many other 'fan bases' I'm familiar with, but the example I'll give is that of the Transformers fans - yes, fans of the big form-shifting robot toys, and the associated cartoons and comic books. Now before you dismiss me outright, hear me out for a minute. The 'Trans-fans' are often known to show a certain level of dissatisfaction with what is currently available to them, though they still buy and like the Transformers in general. They eagerly anticipate new information on upcoming toys and media, and there's an immediate reaction when that info appears. A lot of people show their disappointment, either subtly or vocally, that the new stuff doesn't live up to their possibly impossible expectations. Others are more guarded, and reserve judgment until they can actually examine the new stuff in person. Still others lash out at the complainers, saying they should all be grateful that Transformers are still being made, and just accept what they're given. Does any of this sound familiar to you?

There are distinct differences of course between that 'user base' and our own, but it does show that some things are universal. Another related item is that the Transformer fans are oft-reminded of the fact that they are not the main demographic of the company - the kids far outnumber the adult fans, so there's little reason for the company to accede to the fans' wishes. It's not quite the same, but it's more than likely that even if every current Amiga user bought a newtechnology Amiga, the Amiga company might still fail. The market is vastly different today from when the Amiga 1000 and 500 pioneered into it. Therefore it's not surprising that Amiga is searching in as many directions as they seem to be, to find a piece of the market where they can be successful. It seems that place is definitely not what a lot of Amiga users really want for the next generation, but I can't help but wonder if Amiga needs that obligation, especially when it could mean their own floundering or failure. I won't say that Amiga has a good handle on exactly what they should be doing to find success, but I will drop into a pattern and say we could be happy with the fact that Amiga (and the related hardware and software companies) bothered to do as much as they have for our tiny market. I won't go so far as to imply we should blindly accept whatever we're eventually given, but we can at least make an effort to understand the difficult position of the company in control of our favorite toys.

## Amiga Flavors

## What to choose?

There's an old American saying that politics makes strange bedfellows. Looks like computers do also. Am I the only one who thinks it's ironic in the story below to have a quote from a Microsoft executive talking about Windows CE's multimedia functionality teaming with Amiga's software solution? Well, if it sells Amiga product it's not all bad. Just keep an eye on those folks from Redmond, please, Amiga.

In another bizarre example of seemingly strange bedfellows, we have the trio of Bill Buck, Raquel Velasco (ThendicFrance) and… Petro Tyschtshenko (!) (Power Trading GmbH) teaming up with bplan GmbH to continue work on Morph OS and the Pegasos board, among other things. Even Dr. Allan Havemose, former Commodore AmigaOS guru, is said to be part of the team. This one makes my head ache as I try to figure it all out.

Whatever the technical merits of their products, a couple of things are certain. First, there is only one Amiga and none of these folks is associated with it at the moment. Second, Amiga Inc. would have to be headed by a crazy person to let something that looks and acts like AmigaOS be sold by anyone else. News Flash: Amiga Inc. is not headed by a crazy person. It is headed by the most astute businessman to be in charge of Amiga for a very long time. This is not to demean the very real accomplishments of Petro. If it weren't for him, there would almost certainly be no

Amiga at the present time and for that he will always be near the top of my list of great Amigans. But he's not the businessman Bill McEwen is.

The Amiga community has created some marvelous visionaries, some of whom are listed two paragraphs back. It has created far fewer businessmen. The visions that survive, regardless of whether they are great visions or weak ones, are the ones managed capably as part of a real business. Just compare results - Microsoft's 'vision' combined with its business skills, and Commodore-Amiga's vision combined with Commodore's business skills - and it's very clear what works in the real world.

## Editor's Comments

Well, I finally got here. I'm in the new house now. Things should be easier, right? They might be if I had everything together. But I'm still busy unpacking, and computer-wise I'm still running on dial-up. The DSL connection has been ordered and I have the equipment, but it's not functional yet. As I write this the newsletter is a week late, and I should have had the web site updated yesterday.

Anyway, there doesn't seem to be a lot of news this month. But I hope you find these articles interesting as I did.
