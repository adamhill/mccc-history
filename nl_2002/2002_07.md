## Amithlon Amiga licensing announced

June 23, 2002 - Snoqualmie, WA and Melbourne, Australia

Amiga, Inc. today announced the cross licensing of Amithlon 2.0. The agreement was made with the author and the inspiration behind Amithlon, Bernd Bernie Meyer.

As part of the agreement, Amiga will license Kickstart 3.1 and portions of Amiga OS 3.9 to be distributed as part of Amithlon 2.0. In turn, Amiga will actively promote and license Amithlon 2.0 to OEM customers looking for an Amiga emulator on x86 platforms.

Bill McEwen, Amiga President and CEO, said, 'Bernie has been a good friend and partner to Amiga. I first demonstrated a beta version of Amithlon almost a year ago at the Sacramento show. Even then the quality of the product and its potential were obvious to me. Since then it has become a more polished, a clear reflection of the passion and skills that Bernie brings to the table.

'I have also been impressed by the moral and ethical integrity that Bernie has displayed as he has partnered with Amiga. Too often in the past we have had to deal with companies who would like nothing better than to split the Amiga community. Bernie has always had the best interests of the community at heart and has created a product that we can all be truly proud of.'

'It is with great pleasure that I finally enter into a deal directly with Amiga', said Bernie Meyer. 'This new version, to be distributed with Amiga's seal of approval, provides customers with a clear indication that Amithlon is an actively developed product with great prospects. This partnership will allow users of Classic AmigaOS to use their applications on modern, affordable hardware.'

A demo version of Amithlon 2.0 will be available shortly which can be downloaded free of charge from the distribution site here. The demo version may be upgraded to a fully functional version with a simple keyfile, which can be purchased online.

About Amithlon 2.0 The goal of the Amithlon project was to make AmigaOS 3.9 run on commodity PC hardware. Unlike other approaches to this problem (UAE, Fellow), Amithlon provides AmigaOS with complete control over the hardware. Hosted on a specially modified linux kernel, Amithlon's CPU emulation runs AmigaOS; All access to graphics, sound, networking and interface hardware is provided through standard AmigaOS drivers. Amithlon 2.0 is distributed as a self-booting CD-ROM image.

About Amiga: In 1985, Amiga introduced the world to Multimedia with the launch of the incredible Amiga 1000, a revolution in hardware with dedicated audio and graphics chips and a revolution in software with the first 32 bit, fully preemptive, multitasking operating system. It then went on to dominate the 1980s and early 1990s, pioneering video and animation and giving rise to many of the top gaming companies of today. That tradition will continue with the launch of the brand new AmigaOne desktop computer and its companion, AmigaOS4.0, destined to set new standards and expectations in the world of digital living. Amiga can be reached on the web at http://www.amiga.com.

About Bernd Meyer: Bernd Meyer is a freelance software designer with almost 20 years of experience in professional software development. He has studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Germany and Australia, and is currently completing a PhD on Image Modeling at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In 2000, two of Bernd's hobby projects got out of hand. One turned into Glicbawls, a category winner in the 2000 International Obfuscated C Code Contest, the other into a Just-In-Time compiler for the Amiga emulator UAE, providing it with much greater emulation speed. In 2001, Bernd further refined the JIT Compiler for inclusion in Amithlon.

## My DSL Installation

or, my descent into DSL Hell

In last month's newsletter, I mentioned the fact that my DSL hardware had arrived and I was just waiting for activation of the service. A few days after I wrote those words, the date of activation arrived. This began my descent into 'DSL Hell.' This a term I have often heard before. Little did I know how serious those problems can be. I have had Cable internet service for a number of years. I assumed that DSL would be similar. Bad assumption! The primary difference is that DSL requires software! I still don't

July 27 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am know why. After all, when the DSL or Cable Modem is done handling the signal, what comes into the computer is a standard network connection. Cable Internet service never required anything to be installed on the PC. DSL should have been the same, but it wasn't. I tried using the connection without the software - it didn't work.

When the install program was done with the software installation, it tried to connect to the Internet. No such luck. In fact, I soon discovered that even my dial-up connection no longer worked. Thanks DSL. I spent 14 hours trying to correct the problem through configuration, re-installations, checking with system experts, and even checking the Windoze web

site for help (from work). Nothing helped. I finally had to give up. I re-formatted the hard drive and started over. Of course starting over is not as easy as it is with an Amiga. I logged an additional 30 hours to re-installing and updating software to get things back the way they were. That's 44 hours in all due to a DSL installation gone bad. And I'm not counting the time that I walked away while the PC was busy with an installation.

The moral to the story is… if you can avoid DSL, do it. I'm not sure I can. I'm still trying to find out if I can get Cable Internet. I'll let you know.
