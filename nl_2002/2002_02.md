This is the first new product release for PageStream in almost three years! PageStream4.1 first began life as the Table Editor add-on, but it became clear from our customers that this wasn't an optional feature in PageStream, but an integral part of every day document design. So, the Table Editor has been scrapped, and from its ashes arises the newest release of PageStream with tables built right in!

Place a table on the page, add and delete rows and columns, join cells into larger cells, and set the borders and fill of each cell. Looking for something special? How about a gradient filled cell? Set your text with all the power of PageStream's comprehensive typographic features. Define formulas using basic math functions like + - * / ( ) ^ and higher functions like sum, average/avg, min, max, abs, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, log, int, and exp. Tables have never been so easy to create in PageStream!

But we didn't stop there! Full mail merge with easy variable assignment and optional record range to print, even print multiple records to a page using the label and repeating print functions. Simple yet still powerful. Words that PageStream lives by!

Advanced control over the compression and encoding methods used when outputting PDF helps create tailor made PDF files. Emailing the file to a service bureau? Then save it with ZLib compression and binary encoding. Distributing the files to a wider audiance?

Features

Uncompressed with Ascii85 encoding might be called for. You decide!

Text frames features got a second stage boost into the stratosphere in PageStream4.1! Looking for borders around your text columns? No need to draw a separate box, just offset the text inwards, with each edge set independently. Text frames can now be divided into non-equal width columns.

Object transform has even more control than before! Advanced features such as fading the fill and stroke type to a target fill and stroke make many special effect possible. Even duplicating objects across pages is easy now. Changing your document to a chapter based design? The new move page control streamlines the process!

Of course, PageStream is a little bigger and takes a little more memory than before, but not as much as you might think. Object selection was sped up, and overall improvements to the program structure help streamline its performance and memory footprint. A lot of "under the hood" tuning, not cosmetic window dressing, is what gets the job done sooner. What amazes our customers is how other "competing" applications are often five to ten times PageStream's size, yet don't offer an equally larger amount of functionality. In fact, the opposite is often the case!

## Features

-   Tables!
-   Built in Mail Merge!
-   Shift-cursor text selection!
-   Apply text attributes to using the object or reshape tool!
-   PDF export control over compression and encoding
-   Custom column widths and gutters inside text frames
-   Text inset from column edges!
-   Move pages between chapters
-   Duplicate/Transform objects across pages
-   Duplicate/Transform objects behind the original
-   Fade duplicated objects to a specified line and/or fill
-   Speed improvements
-   and of course much more!

As further proof that PageStream has been, and will always be, the DTP program to beat, a quick look at Quark Xpress 5.0's top 20 wishlist includes 11 items in PageStream, and PageStream has 8 of the top 10! Where does that money go?

## Pricing

I have received many e-mails reminding me of the need to announce the STB OEM partner. We at Amiga are well aware that it was scheduled for last week and, we were expecting the legal department of the partner to have approved the press release. Unfortunately when one is dealing with multi-billion dollar companies it can, more often than not, take longer than planned.

## February Calendar

Feb 23 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am

We did receive the OK to announce to our developers and this was done last week. All NDA developers know the details of the signed OEM deal. However, we are going to have to wait a little while longer for the rest of the Amiga community to see the public release.

I am sorry for the delay, but it will be worth the wait. In fact, we will probably have a couple more that we can announce at the same time. We should have the public announcement out by next week.

Stay tuned ! Bill McEwen http://www.amigamccc.org

## Editor's Comments

Something new this month. I've been working lately on getting my PC set up as an Amiga platform by using Amiga Forever. That task became a little more important recently because I'll be moving to an apartment for a couple of months and won't have room for two computers. Anyway, this marks the first time that I've created the newsletter using PageStream on an emulated Amiga running on a Windows-based PC. This thing flies! My 68040equipped A2000 can't begin to keep up. In a day or two I'll update the web site using Amiga emulation.
