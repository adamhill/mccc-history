## President's Column

Well. we've reached the halfway soint of the dear - and 1984 has seen a 1ct orcwth for Commodore Club. We now have 465 members the and Mid-Cities hava gone from a single group I0 a 4 chacter organization.

The July Quarterly Meeting is only a month away, we had a lot of positive response the cur last quarteri: meeting and many raquests for more of the same. So were clanned the July meeting on ::mE each chacter 15 responsible for one presentation. If you have something tha: vou feel will interest the clus or have an idea for a presentation. Slease det in touch with one of vour chaster officers or Her Wioner.

I know. with 465 members, that we nave a lot of talented and knowledgeable peocle out there. I: vOu thanking that you rave nothine to offer, just because vou still have an occasional question, remember that we are getting new members all the time. These peocle are about where vow were when vou started and they could beneft: from your experience. Don't be sny about volunteering your knowledge and t:me.

## Mistakes Beginners Make by v. Kramer

This article is courtesy of THE USERS PORT, newsletter of the San Fernando Valley Commodore Users Group.

## READ THE INSTRUCTIONS

If it doesn't work, try reading the directions. If that doesn't work try following them. Almost 90% of the questions I'm asked about programming could be answered by simply reading the instructions and spending a few minutes trying to understand them. Most questions are answered in either the Commodore User's Guide. or the Commodore Reference Guide. Get these and use them frequently.

## TOO TIMID

Many people seem afraid that their computer will go up a puff of smoke if they try something different. If you have a problem, make a backup of any disk or tape involved so you won't lose your only copy. Then go ahead and try various solutions to your problem. Chances are that you will figure it out yourself and you may learn something else too!

## TOO AMBITIOUS

A friend who knows almost no programming recently typed in a 200 line basic program. He confidently expected it to work the first time he ran it! Sorry folks, it doesn't work way. Programs in magazines or books usually have a bug or two in them. Some magazines are better than others. As you type in the program, you will probably make some mistakes of your own. So you had better plan to debug the program: Don't get ahead of yourself. It's OK to type programs in from magazines, but keep to the ones you can debug. Let the others wait or let someone with more experience do them.

Similarly, I find people who have never written a 100 line program wanting to write a 1000 line bulletin board. They may try and they will certainly learn from the experience but it is not likely that they will produce satisfactory program. Build your skills gradually. Work up to bigger projects.

## TOO POOR

There really isn't much you can do about this but you should take it into consideration. To do any serious work with your computer will require a printer and a disk drive. A monitor just for the conputer is desirable but you can work with a TV if you must. You should expect to pay about $800-$1000 for vour hardware alone and still more for your programs. books. dosks, paper, modem. and many more incidentals. Don't even bother with the Commodore Datasette - you will outgrow it in a hurry and want a disk anyway. Going straight for the disk will save you money.

of money, Lised equipment...Know what you want, what it sells for in stores and how to tell if condition. Then go ahead and buy a used widget. You can get some real bargains if you do your homework.

## Do It Richt! Part 2

G. Wordelman

This is the second of a four part series that was presented ov Gary at the Quarterly Meeting in April.

## THE OFERATING MODES

1. The direct mode allows you to access the computer directly in order to:

use it like a calculator. (PRINT 5*17)

access input/output devices (to save or load programs or to print a file).

edit existing program lines.

list a program or peek a location.

2. The program mode is the act of running or processing the current stored program in a step by step secuence. Outside actions or interruptions can take blace only if the program allows it. Otherwise the program will run to completion betore it returns control to the direct mode.

## THE COLOR SELECTION

1. Select contrasting (light/dark) colors for the screen/characters and screen/border. Use colors that give sharp letters and are easy to read.
2. For a quick character color set. use CTRL key with #1-8 or Commodore Kev with # 1-8.
3. In a program mode, use the CHR* value or within quotation marks use the key sumbols from the preceeding step.
4. In either mode use the following:

## OPERATORS &amp; THEIR PROCESS ORDER

1. Algebraic operators can be used on numbers only, The left to right priority is
2. Rational operators =, &lt;. › S=, 2, 0) can operate on numeric or string values and are limited to one per stated condition.
4. Grouping Symbols will have the innermost set 2322 Parentheses () used to group conditions. Use these when in doubt of order. Brackets +1 are not a useable group and can only be used for display in REM or inside quotes of PRINT statements. Double Quotes " are used to identify string constants &amp; must be used in pairs.
3. Logical operators (NOT, AND. OR) can be used with numeric or string values.

FIRST - powers ()

SECOND - mult. (*) &amp; division (!)

THIRD - addition (+) &amp; subt. (-)

## VARIABLE NAMES

1. All variables must start with an alpha (A-Z) character and may consist of any number of additional letters or digits. Only the first TWO characters used are recognized as unique.
2. Variable description
3. Variable names cannot start with the letters of any BASIC command. Check the list of basic commands in your User's Guide to avoid using a variable name such as LEND$ (LENgth). TITLE$ (TIme) or START$ (STatus) etc.

At the May meeting of the Fort Worth chapter of MCCC, I presented a slide program comparing the way COMAL and BASIC are used to create relative files. After the progran a question and answer session was held in which I provided some incorrect (and incomplete) answers. I hope this article will correct those points.

that I would like to sell. Can I include the disk version 0.14

At the time of the meeting I had read that a license was required to provide COMAL 0.14 with commercial programs. In the second issue of COMAL TODAY newsletter fon the top of page 3) Len Lindsey writes:

"I'm writing a COMAL program COMAL with the program?"

If you write professional programs to run under C64 COMAL permission to include the the unchanu you have unchanged C64 COMAL 0.14 system on the disk with your programs (but you still need a license to sell COMAL itself).

"HOw can I list COMAL programs to my printer?"

(PRG) files use:

First load the program into memory; for saved

LOAD" PROGRAMNAME" For listed (SEQ) files use: NEW ENTER" PROGRAMNAME"

Then use: SELECT"LP:" //sets output to disk LIST

//will list to printer

If you don't have a Commodore printer or an emulator type of interface you can send any secondary address like this:

OPEN FILE 255, "", UNIT 4,5 1/5 is the secondary address

SELECT "LP:"

LIST

You can send control codes with a PRINT statement before the SELECT statement:

PRINT FILE 255: CHR$ (27) + "G"

File number 255 is reserved by the system to address the printer. Apparently, this file number does not automatically send line feeds (as BASIC would). So you have complete control by DIP switches or secondary addresses.

"Are there any other versions of COMAL?"

The version 0.14 is the most recent release. Version 0.12 is obsolete, and, it has bugs. If you should have version 0.12, get the new version from the club library. Also a cartridge version (2.00) has been delayed; this version will be a cartridge with 64K of ROM. The language should have every feature of COMAL including built-in joystick, light pen, and KOALA-pad routines.

"What books are available for COMAL?"

I have the COMAL HANDBOOK by Len Lindsey. It is excellent-if only Commodore could document this well, although it covers version 0.12 and 1.02 (for PETs) it applys to the 0.14 as well. CAPTAIN COMAL GETS ORGANIZED is a tutorial book by Mr. Lindsey. There are several other books as well. The COMAL HANDBOOK is out of print at the moment, only 400 copies or so are left. Someone mentioned that a book called COMAL FOR THE 64

replacing the HANDBOOK.

in COMAL.

Now there are disks availible for most of the books; books and disks cost about $19.95 each. The COMAL today newsletter costs $14.95 for six issues (one year). The subscription seems to be for a calendar year, so if you subscribe now you should immediately receive three issues. By issue two they have already published 99 programming notes and have started listing special procedures

"How much memory does COMAL leave for

There are over 9900 bytes (9.6K) available. The language is extensive and yet the 0.14 version is incomplete. As mentioned above, the programs?"

full COMAL requires 64K Of ROM.

Also, you can have variable names up to 78 characters long, yet they don't use up a lot of memory. The names are that tokenized; so use names can be read and understood, i.e. ram'memory' checksum# makes more sense than rmc#. Other News

The directorys of the eight disks available on COMAL were printed in COMAL TODAY. They are:

A version of COMAL for the APPLE runs under CP/M. Also an IBM PC version is due by Christmas.

A COMPUSERVE section has been formed for

COMAL. It is within section #6 of the programming SIG (special interest group).

## Free Software Department:

The COMAL USERS GROUP is starting a USER GROUP software library. For every disk of public domain COMAL programs sent in, our club will receive a disk of programs written by another group· I sent a disk of software to our librarian, Leonard Parker, but it is pretty slim. If you have any routines to add to help fill out the disk, please get in touch with me or one of the librarians.

This week I have received disk of procedures from Len Lindsey. The real bonus is a HIRES screen dump written by Tom Kuiper. This is slow leight minutes per screen) but it works. The demo program creats pie charts and, as you can see, it really works:

Our summer chapter meetings will be July 14th and August 11th at 10:30 a.m. in the Arlington Public Library at Center and Abram.

Our thanks to the Rev. Pat McCoy for his presentation at our May meeting comparing various Data Base Frograms. Dur thanks also to Don: Bennett for his presentation in June on the use of Spreadsheet frograms. We: certainly appreciate the time and effort these men have spent on our behalf.

The July program will be a demonstration of the various the Gemini Printer by a representative of Star Micronics, Inc. Don't miss it! After all, isn't a capabilities of demonstration worth a thousand manuals?

Super Cocy 64 does most of the things a copy utility 15 supposed to do. but won't work with a non-Commodore cisk drive. I bought the program before I got the Jual MSD drive. and now tind I have no use for Super Coov. If vOu have a 1541 and like to coDy 'or nave a large collection of diskettes to manage, this propram will be worth the money. It can use two 1541's. That's a big blus because all disk backuns become a "hands Off" operation. No disk swaoping is necessary.

The 1541 should scin at FFM, but a variance of only 2RFM can mean difference between a good drive and a service ca11. timing belts and stiff diskettes are the or:mary Bad sources of speed related problems.

I had to reciace che, that's now! As owner. I know ail about problems Long time 1541 the drive can manifest. The first sigr of trouble may be a loud scracing 0013e. heard throughout the neighborhood, whenever the disk is rattle, turn off the drive immediately. The fix problem is ver. easy it vou can use a screwdriver, but it may cost you $40 if you have the oroblem repaired at the 22225 death this shop.

A large metal aulley on the bottom of the drive loosened up and slipped down the shaft until it hat the metal housing under the drive. If arg mandy with small docis and comoletely tearlese, disassemble the drive and remove the Alos mechanical unit. Turn it upside down vour (clean) workbench and look at the hub puller that the belt turns. That sulley will have to be forced back in clace by GENTLY tapping with a plastic mallet. a little clay in the the pulley LIAMS freely and then epoxy a center the pulley, securing the shaft, pulley and dime. Super alue works also, This results in a permanent repair.

If all this banging and glueing terrifies you. seng the drive to a repairman.

## Basic Assembler

Tom Lynch

· This article is courtesy of THE USERS PORT, newsletter of the San Fernando Vallev Commodore Users Group.

The reason for assemblers is imcortant, maybe not now but some dav vou will want to use one. You perhaps have good quantity of software that .. was written with assemblers. You will find assembled programs games, graphics. the COMAL disk, and in general wherever speed and/or piracy protection is needed. Even the BASIC your machine was assembled from raw code to create the language vou al! love and hate!

I would like to prasent a trivial example of an assembly efficient but I feel the examole resented shows thé assembly tennique.

Some BASICa have VTAB and HTAB commands to move the cursor anvwhere on the screen so that a messace can be printed independent 3f the bravious screen output. For ecample, this would be of value in displaving a prompt message at the bottom of the screen.

It vou look in the C-64 Reterence Guide (the VIC 20 Mas similar routines!. you will find a kernal routine called PLOT. With it vou can read the cursor position or write to a preprogrammed screen position.

To show vou how to do this in BASIC with a few POKE'S follow this examole.

First create the small machine language program outlined in the Refernece Guide on page 290. Let us use the cassette buffer for our crogram: it starts at location he etcetion of were tere decimall with (base 16).

| 828   | (row)    |             | PLOT ROW   | $FFFO 828   |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 82°   | (column) | (column)    | COL        | 829         |
| 830   |          | 174 060 003 | START LDX  | #829        |
| 830   |          | 172 061 003 | LDY        | #829        |
| 836   | 024      |             | CLC        |             |
| 837   | 032      | 240 255     |            | USR FLOT    |
| 840   | 096      |             |            | RTS BASIC   |

You can hand assemble small programe such as the one above on a piece of paper.

Next we create the BASIC loader by making DATA statements that have the values in B1. B2, and B3 of the above example. Thev have to be in decimal because BASIC thinks that way. The order is in ascending memory sequence. Compare with above.

100 DATA 174,060.003.172.061, 003, 024

110 DATA 032,240.255,096

120 FOR I = 930 to 840

130 READ DD

140 POKE I. DD

" 150 NEXT

You can see that we have poked the program into memory with simple read and poke statements the desired memory location. Now the routine to use it.

- 500 POKE 828.R R: REM FOW

510 POKE 829 C : REM COLUMN

- 530 SYS ( 830) • REM JUMP TO ROUTINE

540 PRINT. "MESSAGE"

In line 500 we poke the row number and in line 510 we poke the column number into the previously determined locations. The SYS command causes BASIC to transfer control to the routine we wrote at 830 decimal, It our program works, BASIC will now position the cursor at the desired column and row which allows us to print message. I will let you figure out how to do this without writing the machine code program assembling it and poking it into memory. But all I really wanted to do. was introduce you to the subject of assemblers. understand now and will sometime try to do something : in machine language.

In the ever growing field of telecommunications. services are springing up like crazvo Modem users are always looking for a new way to utilize their equipment. An affordable way to participate in the telecommunication craze is to join a Bulletin Board System (BBS). A BBS a telecommunications program which automatically answers the phone, gives an opening message. and if you enter password, allows you to access its services through a master menu. Some of these are overational such Chat (with the system operator). Kevboard Mode (caps or lower case). Off (to hang Your Member Status. etc. In addition you can Scan. Post or Remove messages which appear on the BBS, send or read electronic mail. access general topics. get computer tips Or sometimes play a game.

Several 98S's are dedicated to certain subjects. There are pirate boards which are dedicated to "crackers' who break programs for. illegal copying and "hackers who obtain codes and basswords for other svstems. There are conference trees which begin with a main message its trunk with many tocics branching trom and: several hundred messages bramching further. There are also dedicated to most of the computer types.

As you access the different boards you will notice many different types of programs. The two BBE programs which are most prevalent are called "NETWORKS II" and " VBBS? (Your Bulletin Board Service!. Both are abie to be customized to fit a specific system operator's wishes. with parts of the program rewritten to add ditterent features.

For the last 9 months 1 have been recaring and aligning hundreds of Commodore Disk Drives from all over the Most of the problems, rumors and misinformation arise from a manufacturing defect that allows the drives to go out of alignment easily. Problems with heat, the "g" save· disk interchangeability with the 4043 can all be traced to improper drive setup (speed and alignment).

The head alignment. between a verv cold and a verv hot drive. can move inwards 0006" for a 77 degree of temperature rise. A drive that is in alignment +/- 002" tolerance before needing an alignment and will still read and write properly beyond 4/-,002", An extreme heat rise of 77 degrees, causing the head to shift inwards 006" will not affect a properly aligned drive. but it might cause a borderline unit to not perform properly.

Everv drive with a save "g" problem that have worked one with the exception of one, has been due to misalignment.

I have been writing to and reading from 4040 formated disks with my 1541's for over six months and have yet to see any signs of slow destruction, or any other improper rotational speed are the keys to trouble free use.

Improper or non-existant lubrication on the rails that the head assembly rides on contributes to noisy head movement (chattering) and improper centering on a track, possibly resulting in head errors. I have found that Molybdenum Disulfide in a volitile liguid seems to provide the quietest and longest lasting performance, lasting up to a

I have also modified most driveg that I have worked on: so that the user can check and adjust the disk speed externally and not have to take the drive apart to make this adjustment.

The easiest way to tell that your drive has changed alignment is a change in the sound that the drive makes when it "Bumps" (the rapping sound made when the drive starts to format a new disk). The "bumping" should be sharp and rapid and equally spaced. If you notice a change, be assured that your alignment has shifted, and this shifting may occur unpredictably at any time. Other indications that this shift has taken place is that. the red light will flicker on and off when trying to load a program that in the past has given a steady red light. Your load times may be longer, and the drive might give that "bumping" sound that it does when you "new" a disk. If too much slippage occurs, all your previously "saved" programs and directions cannot be read by your drive. The sneaky thing about this is, that if it shifts you can still "new" disks and save programs and read them OK. but disks made, and programs saved before the shift will be unreadable or hard to read by your drive, and disks made after the shift will be unreadable or hard to read by any drive that is in proper alignment. This means that it your alignment shifts. and you don't notice it, or ignore it, vou could lose all your "saved" programs after the shift occured when you do get the drive alignmed or it shifts again.

One problem that has plagued owners with two or more 1540/1541 disk drives has been that they continually lock, themselves and the computer up. Commodore has finally cured that problem. The drives that have been selling since Xmas have a new ROM(-05) in location UB4 (shor board) and some harwire modifications that eliminate the drive lockup problem. The other built-in problem with the assently. This 15 1540/1541 drive is an improper design of the upper spindle assembly. This is the unit that pinches the disk against the rotating drive ring. This misdesign causes rapid wear of steel washers in this assembly as exhibited by a possibly intermittent grinding, squealing or howling noise when the disk is turning. I am currently putting together a kit that will allow the user to repair his own drive.

Sometimes a drive will have a problem in that it gets out of sync between where the head actually is, and where the drive thinks it is electronically. In this gituation the drive appears not to work at all, but it is easily cured by "new"ing a disk. It doesn't matter if there is adisk in the drive or not. All you are trying to accomolish. is to have the drive make that knocking sound. When it is doing that it is re-synchronizing the stepper system.

Another point that has caused much discussion has beer the need to use different. ID's on your disks. The photocell that "reads" the write protect notch has another function. It senses a disk change and causes the BAM to be reread. This is why similar IDs do not cause ..a problem: the intelligent drive knows that you have changed disks.

Speaking of disks, if you can fit it into the Commodore Disk Drive, vou can use it.. Soft sector. hard sector. single, double, quad density, it doesn't matter. The Commodore Disk Drive was designed to use the lowest requirement disk (single density, soft sector). Anything more is unnecessarv and often a waste of money. When 1540/1541 drive is properly repaired and aligned it 1s virtually trouble free and an excellent value for the price.

If you do have to get your drive aligned because you cannot read any of your older disks. you can "save" any important programs that are still readable to a Cassette or another 1540/1541 Then it these programs can no longer be read by the aligned drive, you can still recover them from cassette or the other drive.

To get your drive in proper shape, a serviceman should be able to properly fix the two slippage points that allow the drive to go out of alignment. check that the write protect photocell 15 properly performing both functions, set the head radial alignment and check the hysterisis, properly lubricate the required locations, and adjust the disk speed. The serviceman, for a lesser fee, should also be able to repair a new drive so that it doesn't 90 out of alignment.

I have tried to provide information based upon my experience in aligning and repairing Commodore Disk Drives that will be helpful to drive owners and potential drive owners. The drives do have problems, but once they are fixed properly they perform reliably.

## Board Report

The June Board of Directors meeting was held June 2 at Chisholm Park in Hurst. President Diane Dews called the meeting to order at 11:30. Each chapter had members present to represent them.

The first order of business concerned the clubs' need for liability insurance. It was determined that the club could obtain $500,000 worth of insurance for a fee of $300 per year. The Board passed a motion to present this to the various chapters for their approval.

It was resolved that the format for the next Club meeting would be a series of presentations given by each chapter on whatever topic they choose. Each chapter would be responsible for their own topic.

There was some discussion on proceedures to insure that the Club and chapter librarians have a complete that the club of available public domain software. It was decided that the librarians would develop a:. proceedure to insure that software obtained by one would be made available to all.

The meeting was ad journed.

## REVISED LIBRARY RULES

The continued growth of our club has necessitated some changes in our "handling proceedures." These changes will greatly reduce the handling tine required of the librarians for each request. This is the tine used in the initial folding, addressing, and stamping of each sailer. By . reducing this tine, you, the nembers, will receive your requested copies sooner.

Hereafter, aembers are requested to furnish a PRE-FOLDED, PRE-ADDRESSED, and PRE-STAMPED nailer with their completed request and blank disks. NEW MEMBERS will be given due consideration and assistance to get started.

NOTE: * Use care in the initial folding of your mailer to guarantee function and prolong life.

&amp; Use a straight-edge along the pre-cut fold lines.

&amp; For 2 disks, fold each tab on the ist and 2nd pre-cut fron the Riddle.

&amp; For nore than 2, fold on the ist and 3rd pre-cut.
