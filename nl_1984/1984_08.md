## HEB News

for the HEB chapter meeting in August "Music with the C64. It will include an explanation of the sound capabilities of the 64 and demonstrations of Music Construction Set, Synthy 64 and Musicale. Come and be a part of the symphony.

## President's Column

I'm sure everyone will be as pleased and surprised as I was to learn that we have reached the 500 mark on membership! I hope the MCCC will continue to grow and provide many services for our members.

The club library has increased over the last year and a half. also. but few of the contributions have been from our own members. (WE really appreciate those of you have written programs and donated them to the library.) In an effort to encourage our members to write and contribute programs to our library, the MCCC is sponsoring a contest. We hope the prizes will provide more of an incentive. Details of our contest are listed on the next page. Every entry wins a prize!

Over 30 people signed LID for the Jim Butterfield Tape classes. Each chapter will be conducting classes and times for these classes will be announced at the chapter meetings and in the newsletter. The classes are designed for beginners. If you are interested in attending watch the newsletter f cr times and locations or contact: your *contact chapter president.

Several people have expressed interest in Comal and Machine Language. Jesse Cardin has agreed to be a contact point for those people who would like to participate in special interest group. There is further information on this subject in this newsletter.

Diane Dews

## Dads &amp; Ends

Two Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are now forming. If you are interested in meeting with others who are working with either COMAL or MACHINE LANGUAGE, call

Jesse Carden at 838-9530.

The biggest problem with adventure games is knowing what to do with them when you have solved the game: If you are interested in joining a SIG for the purpose of trading purchased adventure games, call Barbara Cramer at 284-3565.

The Commodore Service Center in Dallas is no longer in operation for replacing out of warranty equipment as indicated in the last newsletter. Address your requests for information to

Commodore Business Machines 1200 Wilson Drive West Chester, PA 19380

Classes to view and discuss the Jim Butterfield introductory videotape are still forming. Call your chapter president if you are interested. The Ft. Worth Chapter will showing the tape at their evening meetings, August 20th and Sept. 17 in addition to the classes.

## Another Propram Contest?

Back by popular demand, bigger and better than ever!

Prizes worth over $175.00 to the top three entries and an MCCC cap to all entrants.

Any original "Home or Hobby" program member of MCCC is eligible. The rules are easy: submitted by a

1. Your program must be original.
2. You must agree to make the program public domain.
3. You must be a member of this club.

To enter, submit your program on disc or cassette by Oct. Ist 1984 to any chapter president (your disk cassette will be returned to you.)

This is the last of a four part series that was presented by Gary at the Quarterly Meeting in April.

## CONDENSING PROGRAMS

To save space for more code and to speed the program processing mode, there are several things that can be done in coding a program.

* Remove the REM statements, especially those in often processed sections of the code.
* Remove blanks between commands, variables and operators. Leave only those blanks within string constants, unless TAB can be used to shorten it.
* Use multiple statements per line and fill them as close to the 80 character limit as possible.
* Remove all LET commands but leave the equality intact.
* Dimension all arrays leven if they are less than 10 entries).
* Increment lines by 1 in the final version.
* Omit the second set of double quotes at the end of a line using a PRINT command.
* Use abbreviations whenever desirable.
* If large numbers or long strings are used many times, set them equal to a variable early in the program and use the variable instead.
* Use READ and DATA statements for long lists.
* Use arrays for a series of numbers and/or strings used two or more times (especially if sequential or positional).
* Use GOSUB for often used code sections or routines and put the code used most often near the beginning of the program.

## USEFUL PROGRAM ROUTINES

The following routines can save time and trouble when coding or using your computer.

* The C-64 WEDGE makes many disk commands available in an abbreviated form. Example:
* DISK DEFAULT will allow you to use Load and Save without the " g" trailer.
- "1" for LOAD as "/ pamname"
- "'" or "a" for disk error status
- "'$" or "es" for directory load, etc.
* ONE-TOUCH-CMDS allows you to program the eight function keys with one or more commands to be performed whenever they are pressed.
* MERGE will allow you to add disk programs to the · EN 1000 current one when its line numbers are greater than the last current line.
* AUTO LINE is a routine that will number program lines automatically when coding.
* MENU 1000 is a subroutine which will let you set up several program options as a menu selection.
- display the computer clock as desired.
* CLOCK 2000 is a subroutine that allows you to set and
* DECIMAL 3000 is a subroutine that converts a number to a set decimal length string variable for the purpose of aligning the decimals.
* SCRN COLOR 5000 is a subroutine that allows you to
* SCRN PRINT 4000 is a subroutine that will dump the contents of the text screen to a printer.
- change the screen, text and border colors.
- until a key is hit.
* SCRN FREEZE will let you stop program processing
* TIME DELAY allows you to select the amount of time (in seconds) to pause before processing is continued.

## OFTEN USED PROGRAMS

* MENU is a menu driven disk utility program with many useful options.
* CAPE MENU allows * TAPE MENU allows you to set up a tape listing for
* BACKUF 1541 is a disk copy program for a BAM directory selected copy or a DIRECT track and sector
- easier program access. *

## Arlington News

The July meeting of the Arlington chapter was called to order an July 14 by chapter president, Francine Wharton. A motion was approved to distribute membership list of the Arlington Chapter to

Arlington chapter members.

The program of the month was a presentation on the

Gemini line of printers.

The meeting adjoured to software exchange following a question and answer session.

## Question? ??

The newsletter editors would like to know what type of articles you would like to read and what type of software you would like us to review. Now that we have a wealth of information and software to chose from, it would be helpful to know what you, the readers, are looking for in the newsletter. Thank you for being interested.

COMAL's procedures are advanced versions of subroutines (so advanced that they can be complete programs in themselves). Understanding how procedures and functions work and help you to program is the major part of getting COMAL working.

The first thing you should do is separate procedures from BASIC-type subroutines. Any operation that occurs repeatedly is usually placed in a subroutine. Procedures can be used in this way too, however, procedures are also used for code that is only executed once!

OPEN and CLOSED Procedures

There are two types of procedures, OPEN and CLOSED. The selection of the type determines how the procedure will act upon the variables. First, lets 100k at open procedures.

When a procedure is left open all variables are global. By global variables I mean that the string called "text$" will always refer to the same character string anywhere in the program. By the way, the two slashes (//) you'll be seeing in the program listings represent remarks. Any text that follows the slashes is ignored by COMAL. Now try this example:

```
new auto 0010 // the program: 0020 value:=5 0030 global |/execute procedure 0040 print value 0050 end 0060 |/ the procedure: 0070 proc global //open procedure 0080 value:=7 0090 endproc 0100 PRESS RETURN run 7 end at 0050
```

Since VALUE is global to the procedure, refers to the same number in the procedure as does in the main program. Let's look at it it ·it this way:

![Image](1984_08_artifacts/image_000004_5647805e767f65a00225ac37ffe787ccb9622e53374375729554d636759b501b.png)

Both variables called VALUE refer to the same number in memory, in this case, 5. SO when procedure sets VALUE to 7, changing same location in memory that the main program set to 5.

To make VALUE local to the procedure we make VALUE a parameter by adding procedure like this: must the

0070 proc global (value)

Now, to avoid an error, you must add a parameter to the statement that calls the procedure:

0030 global (value) //execute procedure

When this procedure executes, it has this effect:

MAIN PROGRAM value

PROCEDURE value set equal

[5] — on entry→[5]

NoW VALUE refers to a different location in memory in the procedure than it does when the main program is running. VALUE is now local to the procedure. Note that all other variables are still global to this procedure since it is still OPEN. To make all variables local, we have to add CLOSED to the definition of the procedure:

0070 proc global (value) closed

With this change GLOBAL is no longer a good

11

name tor the procedure. All variables are local with one exception, strings.

Strings remain global unless they are passed as a parameter. Add these lines to the program and run it:

0012 dim text$ of 40 0046 print text$

```
0085 text$:="Inside" run 5 Inside end at 0050
```

Even with a closed procedure TEXT$ still refers to the same string stored in memory:

![Image](1984_08_artifacts/image_000005_30e24ab29793bec0e1818c6038bbdcdeecc469c8f6a79a57fef4f543427b886c.png)

The only way to make a string local is to use it as a parameter, 1.e.:

0030 global(value, text$) 0070 proc global(value, text$)

If you run the program with this change no text will be printed because TEXT$ is now local within the procedure.

By leaving strings global, we can pass large string arrays to the procedure for processing. But in general, closed procedures can't get to variables from the outside and outside program lines cannot get at the data within a procedure; we have to pass all needed variables to the inside.

Adventure games have become more sophisticated in the past year. Many early adventures transported you to a world of sword and warlords and wizardry, macho and muscle. While using your intellect, you were surronded by an atmosphere of the past. In the last few months several new types of adventure games have emerged. The software counters now show a variety of detective, mystery, and future world adventures as well as a new breed of adventure based on literary or TV/Movie scenerios.

DALLAS QUEST is an intriguing adventure especially suited to beginning players. Experienced game players will enjoy it's exceptional graphics, refreshing humor and moderate challenge as well. Available to all is the ability to ask for hints and a story line that is imaginative and pure fun.

While the characters have been taken from the popular television series, it is not necessary for you to have seen a single episode in order to fully enjoy the game. You are a famous dective in search of a map which locates an extremely rich oil field. The game offers you the ability to save 9 games in progress, a valuable feature when you suspect danger.

DALLAS QUEST was my first experience in adventure games and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. My only regret was Mane ena. since · that I had solved all the "puzzles" and reached the end. Since then, I have played 6 more adventures...I guess you'd say I'm hooked!

Let's start off by assuming that you have received the COMAL Demo Disk and don't have the wildest idea how to use it. Many of us have been in that position, including me. We'll start on the ground floor and assume you know nothing about programming in COMAL.

## READ THE LABEL

The place to begin our trek into COMAL is on affixed to the diskette. It should say COMAL 0.14. That's COMAL LOMA the label the revision. (o.12 is outdated and should not be used.)

The loading instructions should say:

LOAD "BOOTCOMAL", 8

That means put the disk in the 1541 and load the language a very When you see READY, type RUN and COMAL will begin like you would any other 'program'. BOOTCOMAL is short BASIC loader program that loads in the language. loading. It takes about two minutes, so while you wait, read the screen. It has some valuable information.

It says that COMAL programs may be SAVEd to the disk just like in BASIC but you never have to use the ""8" specify which drive. COMAL doesn't work with tape. It also says you may 'LIST' a program to the disk. This is a

Real Neat Thing, so I'll go into it in some detail.

## LISTING PROGRAMS TO THE DISK

Let's say you have a COMAL program loaded and in memory. This could be a sample program, like the ones found on the Demo Disk or one you've written. To place the program on the disk permanently, you can save it like this:

SAVE "PROGRAM NAME"

That writes the program to the disk as a "program file", which can be LOAded and RUN later. (Just like BASIC.) What would happen if you wanted to merge two programs? Since COMAL programs are written in modules, merging two or more programs is something you will want to do occasionally. Nothing could be easier. LIST takes care of it for us automatically. Here's how it works.

Load a program into memory. Send the program to the disk like this:

LIST "PROGNAME.L"

Notice we didn't SAVE the program, we LISTed it. The program is now recorded on the disk, not as a "program" file, but as a "sequential" file. The ".L" tacked onto the filename says this is a LISTed program, not a data file. You can't LOAD a program that was LISTed to disk, but you can retrieve it by ENTERing it. It's like LOAD, but used only with LISTed programs. To get the LISTed file back into memory, do this:

ENTER "PROGNAME. L"

Bingo! It is back and now may be RUN just like any other program. So far, so good, but remember we wanted to merge two programs. When you ENTER a LISTed program, it will Mr with an eristi merge with an existing program in memory. Both programs

The line numbers of each program should be different, or big trouble will result. COMAL has a renumber function built in, so use it to change the line numbers of the program in memory before you ENTER another program. renumber the lines to start with 9000, key in 9000". Then ENTER the next program and

·To "RENUM RENUM again (without 9000). Try it and see what happens.

## LIST IT AGAIN

LIST may also be used to list the program to the screen or the printer. If you LIST to the screen, the space bar will pause the listing until hit again. The return key stops the listing. To get a program LISTed to the printer, key in:

SELECT "LP: " LIST

When the printer stops, key in:

SELECT "DS: "

This select business is like the BASIC "Open 4, 4: CMD4".

## PLAY BALL !!

When COMAL is loaded, you may be asked if you want error messages. Answer no unless you really want to see them. Now you have some options on the screen. Help, Demo, Info and Program. Try each option in order and see what happens. If you tire of the show, press RUN/STOP and key in "LOAD HI". That gets you back. After looking at the pretty pictures, keyword explanations and all try loading the directory. Key in "CAT" and watch the disk's directory scroll in. The program in memory will still be there after the directory comes in. Dual drive users can select CAT 0 or CAT 1, but 8 &amp; 9 won't work. Browse the directory and pick out something interesting. On a blank line key in "NEW" to erase the current program and then put the cursor on the line of the program want to load. If the filename ends in ""L", key in ENTER. If not, key in LOAD and press return. Whoops! ERROR 56 will flash on the screen. The cursor will be on the filetype (PRG, SEQ). Press the space bar three times and hit return. That's the quick way to load. Now LIST the program and look at its construction. Much of it won't No 4 it on reare make any sense, but SOME of it will. Look for the keywords PENCOLOR, BACKGROUND or BORDER. Each one controls a color (the number 0-15). Try changing the number (always press return to enter the line). RUN the program and see what you've done.

## BE FEARLESS - EXPERIMENT

Try changing the PRINT statements. Don't worry about the indented spaces, COMAL will indent for you. Usually keywords, numbers and punctuation require a space to set them off. It's not like BASIC. If you keep getting an error, put the cursor on a blank line and key in "SETMSG+". That turns on the messages. Remember that the cursor will be placed on the offending statement, 5o look there first. Each line is checked for proper syntax as you enter it, unlike BASIC.

## FOR THE ADVENTURESOME

If your trip through the COMAL Demo Disk was exciting and pleasurable, you should seriously consider learning how to write programs with this new wonder-language.

Bill Wray was my friend and he has died.

I met him for the first time at the initial meeting of the Mid-Cities Commodore Club. By chance, we sat side by side. The conversation we carried on was, of course, about computers and the possible formation of the club. WE hoped there would enough people in attendance to make the formation of a club practicable. Neither of us visualize the outcome and growth a year later.

It seemed to me important early on to make some kind of contribution to the club effort. so I volunteered for the position of modem leader having only a very slight idea of the complexities of the telecommunication process. It was Bill Wray who helped me understand the process and spent untold hours trying and succeeding in the interpretation of the software. More importantly, he shared the information with the club. His skill in downloading software and rewriting it for the Commodore resulted in some of the more interesting programs available in the first half year of the club"s existance. Shoplist, Checkbook and many others, so many in fact, that we carried a disk full of programs to trade which we had gotten from him.

His contribution to the club was quiet but significant, his enthusiasm and his understanding of the computer encouraged and taught others. As we have as a club grown in numbers, we are one less with Bill Wray"s death. We are one remember him and convey our sympathy to his family.

Why spend your money on a premium word processor when some public domain programs · ore sent free PAPERCLIP is one of the best arguments for spending a few dollars for a quality program.

PAPERCLIP (with built-in SPELLPACK) is produced by Batteries Included and comes with two disks, a thorough owner's manual, warranty and registration mysterious little one inch box which plugs into the joystick port. I soon discovered that the box is a key, without which the program will not run.

This brings me to my only serious objection to entire program...the manual. The tutorial section of the instruction manual is very well written progressing in a logical and understandable manner. Editorial terms are defined nicely for the beginner and the lessons proceed from simple to more complex functions. The index is valuable to locate instructions that are not often used.

However, the manual was written to cover a number of Commodore computers and becomes confusing unless you mark and read only those sections that apply to your specific model. Special Code Keys are used throughout the book to perform different functions. The actual ta press for these cades varies fram one Commodore makey to another. While this is not difficult to figure out, it will cause you to either flip back to the Code Chart often, memorize the codes immediately or customize your manual by penciling in your particular code key whenever it is referenced. In the overall program this terribly significant: it will just take you a bit longer to master the use of the manual and the program.

Now for the really great news! There are so many good features that it is difficult to know where to begin. Here is a checklist of the capabilities of PAPERCLIP that I found most useful.

* Both disks may be copied by user. (PAPERCLIF even provides the utility program).
* Owner's Manual includes a tutorial section, index and reference section (no quick reference card).
* With one keystroke you can move the CurSor LP, down, left, right and to the top or bottom of a screen or document.
* You can copy, move, delete, save and read blocks of text.
* You can delete single characters, words. whole lines, sentences, screens and all text following the cursor.
* You can search for a word or part of a word, replace words and verify the replacement.
* The program displays 23 lines of 40 characters each and shows page, line and column counters onscreen:
* The program supports 80-column hardware and will display a virtual representation of the printed text.
* Unfortunately PAPERCLIP does not include automatic word wrap! lines longer than 40 characters do wrap onscreen.
* The user may set right and ieft margins, centering, line spacing, number of lines and page numbers anywhere at top or bottom of page.
* There is both an insert and overtype mode.
* The program will print headers and footers, print in two columns and right justify the text.
* You can set tabs, add data to columns, sort columns, change screen colors and automatically center headings.
* The Spelling-Checker runs easily and relatively fast.
* You can embed page breaks in the text, have page breaks displayed on the screen, and force lines to stay together during page breaks.
* A user-created dictionary is provided to check the spelling of words not found in the 15,000 word PaperClip dictionary.

If your printer is suitably interfaced and is capable of the following,

* Besides allowing you to save text to tape or disk, PAPERCLIF allows you to format disks, merge files, rename, save and delete files and get a disk directory while you are entering text.
* PAPERCLIP will allow you to overstrike, underline, and doublestrike.
* You may print compressed characters or double-wide characters and you can modify the program codes fit your printer.
* You may use proportional spacing, subscripts and superscripts and italics.

Overall, PAPERCLIF is a very powerful word processor with a good manual, It includes most of the features found in other word processors plus a few special features of its own.

## Book of Adventure Games

"Once upon a time when 16K computers were still the size of a house, there were adventure games. Since then, the two have evolved together.... Adventure games can excite the imagination, but they can be frustrating too. If all you need is just a hint or peek at a map to help you come unstuck, help lies between these covers."

The Book of Adventure Games by Kim Schuette is published by Arrays, Inc. and is dedicated to "the world of frustrated adventurers who have for so long wondered where their next clue was coming from." The introduction of this fascinating book includes History of Adventures, Good Adventure and How To Tackle an Adventure Game.

The bulk of the book, 237 pages, contains the descriptions and maps for over 75 various games (including 30 maps for Time Zone!). Black and white illustrations of the graphics accompany a short description of the game's playability. This can be of good use in selecting your next purchase. Possible solutions are located in the final 90 page section. It should be noted that the solutions do not tell you every little detail of play. This would certainly ruin the challenge of any game and take the satisfaction of solving it away from the player. The solution guidelines are numbered and correspond to numbers on the maps. you really get stuck look for a number on the map, the corresponding number in the solution and continue the game. The system provides assistence without sacrificing your imagination.

## Board Report

The August Board of Directors meeting was held the Hurst Recreation Center. President Diane Dews called the meeting to Fifteen officers and members were order. present.

The first order of business concerned providing the various chapters with VHS and BETA video tapes on the James Butterfield C64 introductory class. A list of those members who signed up for the class was given to representitives of each chapter. Each chapter will schedule their own training sessions depending on availability of the tapes. The board voted to have the Club pay for the meeting room expenses incured for this training for each chapter.

Nelson stated that the Club Treasury had $3976 in it and at the current spending rate should have approximately $3000 in it by the end of the year.

Leonard Parker, Club Co-librarian, requested the club purchasa 73 mailers from him at $0.95 each which is what he paid for them. The board voted to purchase the mailars from Leonard and provide them equally to the chapters.

It was suggested that the club put together d Cø4 training packet on how to get started. It would include various articles from past newsletters that provided helpful tips and programs. In addition a disk of start up programs would be part of the package. Gary Wordelman, Barbara Cramer, Roy Baker, and Dan Branam volunterred to put this package together.

It was decided to sponsor a programming contest with three prizes valued at $100, $50, and $25. See the anouncement in this newsletter for details. The meeting was ad journed.
