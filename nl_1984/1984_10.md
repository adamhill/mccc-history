## President's Column

Diane Dews

As an officer of the M.C.C.C., I have had the opportunity to serve and contribute, and in return, I have gained much in knowledge and in friendships. The shadow of these friendships will remain with me always.

My year is almost over and the time has come to select those people who will lead this organization in 1985. I urge you to attend the Oct. quarterly meeting to vote and if possible to volunteer to serve in one of the many jobs as an officer or assistant in the coming year.

Our quarterly programmers contest has ended with a record number of entries and we will be announcing the winners at the Oct. 20th club meeting.

I am pleased to announce that we will be having special guests at our quarterly meeting. The T.C.J.C. news organization will be taping our activities in preparation for a news special on C.B.S. Blackhawk Cable in November.

See you at the meeting.

Diane

## Comal 2.D

Colin Thompson

Reprinted from the September issue of Communique, Commodore 64 West User's Group.

Through an agreement reached between Len Lindsay of the COMAL Users Group and Commodore Denmark, a small quantity of COMAL 2.0 cartridges will be imported into this country early next month.

The price of the cartridge is $100. Only 500 cartridges will be available, with 400 going , to the COMAL Users Group and 100 going to the United States COMAL Users Group (USCUG). The announcement marks the end of a two year long series of negotiations between the COMAL group and Commodore. Since Commodore USA refuses to import and distribute the cartridges, the Denmark connection will be the only source for the American market for awhile.

This is the news many of us have been waiting for. Since only 500 cartridges will be available, you should order one immediately from either source. The COMAL. Users Group will sell the cartridge. the new COMAL Handbook, 2.0 Users Manual, "package" documentation, and two diskettes of 2.0 software in a bundle for $100. USCUG has yet to determine what will be included with the cartridges they sell, but similar package envisioned. You must be a member of USCUG to purchase 2.0 from them. Membership is $20.

If you want the cartridge. don't delay. They will be gone in less than a month.

If you order a cartridge from the COMAL group, you must send a check or money order for $99.95 plus $3 for handling. That will reserve a cartridge for you. You can send a check for only $30 to USCUG and that will reserve one from them. The $30 will buy your membership and puts $10 downpayment on the cartridge. USCUG will notify you when the cartridge is available and bill you for the amount due. USCUG's cartridges Will be sold at cost plus shipping: 50 the price will be less than $100.

The solution to &amp; problem changes the problem.

That's where we find ourselves. The original problem, as near as I can determine was thisi COMAL 0.14 was viewed as the greatest thing since sliced bread, except by the few of us who had seen the Cartridge version 2.0.

I decided not to talk about the Cartridge in print simply because there was no guarantee it would ever be produced. Why should I get you all fired up about 2.0 if you could never buy it? That wouldn't be fair, so I've concentrated on spreading the word about 0.14, hoping Commodore would make 2.0 available. .

Commodore USA has not changed their corporate minds about COMAL 2.0, but Commodore Denmark has. CBM Denmark is manufacturing 1000 of the 2.0 cartridges with half coming to America. If the cartridge sells well here, more will be made. That is the whole story.

Now that the problem of production has been solved, we have a new problem. What happens to the disk-loaded version 0.14? Will it fade away like an old soldier or will it prove useful though the better version is available? I've pondered this for some time and believe our old friend will not only survive, but prosper.

What's going to happen when those 500 cartridges get into circulation? There will be 500 owners showing prize to their friends. The friends will want a cartridge. They won't be able to get one immediately, so the only alternative is to learn COMAL with the 0.14 and wait for the cartridge. This

COMAL CONTINUED (COLIN)

process will probably continue until Commodore USA sees what's happening nad decides to manufacture the cartridge in large quantities and sell them in every K-Mart on the planet. That's the way I see it.

Commodore would certainly lose those two products, but if they sold 50 to 100 thousand COMAL cartridges instead, they would be way ahead. If you haven't written to Commodore, it's not too late. I know that a few thousand people around the country have written letters, but I don't know what Commodore has done with them. If you wrote a letter, you should send a copy to the COMAL Users Group AND the United States Commodore User Group. Both organizations are collecting letters and will present them to Commodore this fall. is hoped we will present Commodore with enough letters of interest that they will import the cartridge.

The letter writing campaign I started last month critical. Commodore USA is not a religious sect, shrouded in secrecy and ruled by a saint. It is a large corporation that makes decisions based on the age old premise of 'returns vs. investment'. As soon as they realize that they can make &amp; mega-buck or two by selling the COMAL cartridge, they will trot it out. To date their attitude concerning COMAL has been ultra-cautious. And, perhaps with good reason. I SIMON'S BASIC and LOGO would be the first victims of the COMAL cartridge. COMAL has LOGO built in as a sub-section and poor old SIMON is but a whisper the wind compared to the roar of COMAL.

A Review

any special software to operate so practically all programs should load normally.) loaded word processors, a data manager and several games. Some programs required the additional commands to turned off. (See below.)

BUS Card II by Batteries Included is an interface to connect parallel devices (disks and printers) to the Commodore 64. The card plugs into the "game" cartridge port on the back of the computer. It has a standard printer port. IEEE parallel disk port and a cartridge port. This allows you to have a great variety of equipment configurations including serial and parallel printers and disks and still plug in Fit Stop.

The printer interface worked well but most control codes are not sent to the printer. For example graphics are not sent to the printer. A program listing would not display cursor controls or color commands. The printer interface would work best for text applications only.

The options are increased by the uses of cute little switches in the Bus #ard II which determine if the device is parallel through the or still on the Commodore serial port. This would allow you to connect up to four disk drives (including dual units) and more than one printer. You could then use a dot matrix printer for some work and also have a letter quality printer connected.

The card is easy to install. You do have to open the computer case and connect a small clip to a resister wire but no permanent changes are needed. Your dealer or group leader could easily show you.

I connected up my Gemini 10x printer and MSD Dual disk to the Bus Card II. The loading time for programs was almost cut in half. The access time files las many word processor programs use) was decreased but not as much load times. The Bus Card does not require

In summary this unit is an excellant choice to connect a 2031 or 4040 disk drive to the Commodore 64. to have two printers online for fast dot matrix printouts letter quality work. Expanded commands are also available but do not get in the way. Disk access is increased (although not as I hoped.) The printer conversion to non-Commodore umits is somewhat limited. The cost is higher than some similar devices but no other unit provides all these features.

A real bonus of the Bus card is the added commands it provides. The expanded disk commands of Basic level 4 are provided. These include DLOAD, DSAVE, DIRECTORY, COPY, BACKUF and easy access to disk status. Supermon is also available for machine language access. These features may be activated by SYS61000 or removed with a SYS61003 command. This feature overcomes the compatibility problems of some other systems.

VideoLand carries the Bus Card II at reduced price of $176.00. Parallel cables are extra.

that the "Incredible Musical Keyboard."

## Make Mine Music A Review Larry Groebe

Reprinted 9/24/84 with the permission of Startext

It was late last week, and I was in need of a new toy.

Every often, I get an overwhelming: uncontrollable urge to throw some money away on any bright shiny new object that catches my fancy. Years ago, that meant binges on cap pistols and silly-putty. Nowadays: my desires are more sophisticated - new graphics tablets or video games. The expense has mounted, but the need to surround myself with these "toys" hasn't gone away.

So I found myself favorite software store browsing my over last weekend, not really knowing exactly what it was I wanted, yet sure that I would recognize it when I saw it.

I did recognize it when I saw it. My new toy. The &amp; Sound Incredible Music Keyboard" for the Commodore 64.

It should be noted that I am a sucker program that purports to music and the Commodore 64. Music is in one of the I have machine - the C64'g SID stated, can produce chip, simply more and better sOunds than any other chip built into a computer today. It is a true synthesiser, not just a tone generator. This means that it can imitate the sounds of real instruments, and not merely go beep.

But as anyone who has tried to use it knows, mastering the SID isn't easy. CBM didn't offer us users any help from BASIC. It requires many POKES just to make a single note.

In the hands of an expert, though, it can work miracles. Listen to the wonderful theme music from "Crush, Crumble, and Chomp" "Frantic Freddie", or to the sound of the taking off in "Mission Over Moscow."

I have a half-a-dozen music programs the C64. purporting to make composing easy. "Musicale," "Music Construction Set, " "When I'm 64," "Synthi-64" are among them. Now add to

What the IMK is. is a small but functional two-octave music keyboard, a physical device about the same size of your 64. It has little piano-style keys like the ones on those portable synthesisers from Casio and Radio Shack, but no switches or wires. What you do is place it ON TOP of your computer. The piano-keys are designed so that they rest on top of certain typewriter keys on your 64, and so, when you are pressing a note. you will actually be pressing one of the letters your 64'5 keyboard. This "Keyboard overlay" leaves about half the 64's original keyboard untouched for use, including all the function keys.

It sounds like a gimmick - after all, It doesn't DO anything other than press keys that you press. But it works. Anyone who has tried to tap out a tune using the "GWERTYUIOP" keys will know that it ain't easy. And trying to play "chords" is durn near impossible. But put a little piano on top of the computer, and my hands just naturally know where to go. Within moments, I was playing three-part harmony.

No doubt about it, the music keyboard is a clever little device that really works. But as always with computers, the hardware is only as good as the software that uses it. And the disk that comes with the IMK promises much, but delivers little.

Its kind of like buying the Koalapad without a drawing program to go with it. The supplied software with the IMK will let you play the keyboard, but offers you little control. There are only three kinds of sounds you can make - piano, bass, and organ. You can change the octave you're playing in. And that's about it.

Sight &amp; Sound Software thinks you are going to just love being able to do that. They have included in the package two songbooks of "Super-Songs" and "Easy-Songs" so you can pick out a favorite melody right away. In an accompanying catalogue you can order literally dozens of other songbooks pop, country, jazz, you name it.

But heck, I have a piano at home, with bigger keys, and more of them, and I can play more than three notes on it at the same time. So the software was a disappointment. I gave up on it in five minutes.

-

I turned instead to the demonstrations of future "Sight &amp; Sound" music programs that will utilize the keyboard. And there, all was set right again. NOW demonstrations can be misleading, but if these programs deliver half of what they promise, there ARE good things in store.

They named about coming attractions. My two favorites were "3001A Sound Oddyssey", and the Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker". The former is both tutorial and the music synthesiser that I was hoping for. The tutorial looked like it would do a good job explaining what was meant by all those things like ADSR envelopes, resonances and white noise. And the synthesiser appeared to give you all the control over tone quality that you could wish. It looked like it would let you record notes and play them back, and, even change the tonal qualities of note in the middle of a song - which would be quite a feat if they do it well.

The other program, "Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker" is not named after a motorcycle but a top jazz guitarist from Japan who happens also to be heavily into electronics and computers. The Rhythm Rocker turns the C64 into a high-quality programmable percussion instrument. The demonstration didn't show how it worked, but it did play a dazzling demonstration piece that showed off more drum sounds than you can possibly imagine.

Those dazzling demonstrations are just that demonstrations. And demonstrations often have way of looking better than the finished product. In any case, those products aren't with us yet. And until that time, the Incredible Music Keyboard remains product with promise, but no delivery as of yet. We shall see.

In the meantime, I)'ve started looking for another toy.

(Last minute update: Larry has just gotten a copy of the Rhythm Rocker. His intial comments: "Not Bad! Not Bad at all! It really DOES deliver the capabilites of the demonstration disk. You get your choice of drum and bass tracks for you can creat your own) to which you can improvise a melody line or spaced-out percussion. The program is continually drawing some spacey graphics while all this is going on. This makes a high-quality one-man-band. I like it! ")

## Poetrymn by Debbie Smither

THE MAD LIBRARIAN

The mad librarian's at it again, Making copies until the crack of dawn, Running the printer until it's out of ink, And cursing when something goes wrong. Cats bewars, stay out of the room, It's not safe to be around, When the mad librarian's at the computer, It's best to get out of town!

WHEN THE DISK DRIVE DOESN'T WORK

When the disk drive doesn't work. Due to some problem or quirk, The first stage reaction is cool resolve, I'm sure it's something easy to solve! Then comes the second stage wandering through, Everything I need is on disk, whadd'll I do? Finally panic, hot and berzerk Will seep in and start to work On the part of you that controls the funds. You'll go out and buy another one!

ONCE A MONTH...

Once a month around our house, Creeping stealthily like a mouse, The fourth Sunday comes around And our life turns upsidedown. "It's copy time, leave me alone!" A frenzied time therein ensues, And I sneak off to take a snooze, Sixty, eighty, maybe a hundred disks, Are put in to take the copying risk, When it's done and the copies arrive, I thank the Lord for our MSD drive!

## THE INNER CIRCLE

Every civic, social. or professional organization has its inner circle. Whether Lion, Rotary, Mason, Junior League or MCCC, there exists a club within the club. It is usually a small elite who benefit more than the other members. These are the members, the inner circle, who make the majority of decisions control the activities of the I am not condemning this practice as experience has taught that it is the most efficient way to operate in any large group.

I regularly pay my dues to the MCCC and I certainly get my money's worth just from membership. But by contributing a little and effort I get so much more. i.e.. new friendships, advice and information (sometimes almost daily) the knowledge that my voice really does count in how the club is managed the direction it will take in the months to come.

exclusive inner circle is not for everyone. Some members just don't care as long as they get value for their dues. I perfectly understand this attitude. These words are not directed to them. Rather, I am addressing the few of you who do want your club. We welcome you. We you to this club our club. We need assistants to fill the many chapter and club offices.

It is really that simple. Contact your chapter or club president and offer to fill a slot. Believe when I say, rewards will be worth it." There is plenty of room at the top.

STARTEXT, the

Star-Telegram's information service for home computer owners, continues to add new features and services to serve area computer owners.

One of the latest additions should be especially valuable to Commodore owners: a special section of computer "Help" files covering everything from reviews of terminal software and games to a history of Commodore and how to connect your C64 for 1200 baud.

In addition, INFO2 lists other Commodore C64 users on STARTEXT and their electronic mail codes, while INF03 lists VIC20 users, so you can send E-mail messages to others throughout the STARTEXT network.

STARTEXT also features a host of weekly columns for the Commodore user, including James Patman's Commodore Exchange and GdA, Larry Groebe's Commodore Chat and Rick Rexroat's Commodore Programming Tips.

As a matter of fact, there are more Commodore owners on STARTEXT than any

## STARTEXT Adds New Features

Gerry Barker, STARTEXT Manager other computer type.

The newest addition to STARTEXT, and one we are very proud to announce, is Delta Air Lines flights schedules and information.

weather, sports and features.

Now STARTEXT users can access all Delta flights arriving or departing DW Airport. It marks the first agreement of its kind for Delta anywhere in the country.

Unlike CompuServe or Source, STARTEXT charges only one flat monthly rate -- currently $7.95 a month - for unlimited use.

There are special computer columns for all major computer types, as well as one of the most comprehensive computer news sections available.

Subscribers also get a first look at all the NEW classified ads placed in the Star-Telegram the night BEFORE they run in the paper, which means STARTEXT users get a jump on over area 500, 000 readers.

The flat rate price also includes access to closing stock prices and comprehensive financial data, use of E-mail and access to thousands of categories of current news,

Mike Cane, author of the new book. "Online Guide for Commodore Computers, " calls STARTEXT "the best bargain in the country among fee-based systems."

In the near future, STARTEXT is planning to add 1200 baud service, expanded E-mail and a second host computer (the system is currently running on one VAX/750).

New software will be introduced that will improve system performance as well.

We invite every modem owner to try STARTEXT on a FREE TRIAL BASIS. If you hadn't had one before, we can mail you a FREE TRAIL PASSWORD good for five free log ons over a 30-day period.

We think you'11 agree with over 1200 other area STARTEXT subscribers: It's your best value in online services, and one of the best reasons we know to own a computer.

**************************************************************************

HAVE YOU LOOKED AT STARTEXT LATELY?

The MCCC now has a rather large column on STARTEXT that includes meeting times, places and program topics, feature articles from our members and the latest information about our club. Because this column can be updated more often than your printed newsletter, the info will be more accurate and timely. Check it out!

The MCCC would like to thank Christine Russell, and Gerry Barker, STARTEXT Editors, as well as Larry Groebe, columnist, for their invaluable assistence in creating this column for our club. A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO GERRY, CHRISTINE AND LARRY.

Wow! Congratulations and many thanks to Ray Montoro for an absolutely fantastic review of music programs. If any of the chapters have still not heard him speak, I strongly suggest that they approach him about it.

This quarter, the main club meeting will use single program format, which we will follow with a chapter business meeting and software swap. The main order of business will be the nomination of officers for the November elections, and so far, this chapter is really hurting. Fuzzy has put \_ in two years of his time, and it is time for someone else to take as top dog. There will also be openings for the other offices, which include Vice-President and Secretary. The people currently acting as Reporter and Librarian have offered

Scott Payne to stay on, so these offices are not in ag bad shape as the others, though anyone is welcome to run for them. Speaking of officer elections, those people attending the Monday night charge : meetings also need to hold elections and apply for recognition as a chapter. If not, they are going to have a problem when Fuzzy quits residing over these meetings as well. The will regular night meeting will

## Discounts &amp; Decisions

With Christmas just around the corner, the stores will be stocking up on a large variety of new titles in software. This is a good time to start reading magazine reviews before you buy, Here's a list of featured reviews for this month from four of the most popular magazines.

I would also recommend using the telephone to check for availablity and lowest price. Toys'R'Us and Babbage's are excellent sources for the newest software at discount prices. K-Mart and Target also carry a selection of Commodore merchandise. These stores do not give an additional discount to club members as their prices are already less than retail. The following stores will give MCCC members an extra discount so be sure to take your membership card. Please note that these discounts do not usually include sale merchandise which already carries a reduced price.

## Doodle!

Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I will simply present the following doodle. After learning the basic techniques of this program, I tried to illustrate all the features that are included. I am very impressed with DOODLE. It's a more serious drawing tool than the name implies.
