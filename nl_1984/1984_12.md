## WORDPRO 3 and Special Print Features Grady Langley

My only dissapointment with the WORDPRO 3 word processing software is the absence of special print commands which would allow the of fancier printing options on most printers. I have an Epson RX 80 printer which has the capability of emphasized, italic, compressed, expanded, and elite print as well as some combinations thereof. The WORDPRO 3 instructions contained no information about this, only directions for special character commands.

My need to change print styles in mid-text went unsatisfied until I read an article in the September 1984 MCCC News. The author, Jay Peat, told how he accomplished the .with EASYSCRIPT word processing software. Soon I had mastered the trick with WORDPRO 3.

The key to the trick is the special character feature of the software. Up to ten special ASCII values can be used at any given time when defined by a format statement. The instructions refer to these values only for a use in printing special characters such as "^" which has decimal value of 94 in the ASCII codes for the Epson printer. These featureg are described on page 8-5 of the WORDPRO 3 instructions. For example, to print "^" you define in a format statement 0=94, then the "up arrow" followed by "g" in in the text where the special character is desired.

The Epson printer interprets certain ASCII codes as a command to change print style, as do most printers. For compressed print the Epson recognizes the control code CHR# (15) to turn on that print style, and CHR$(18) to turn it off. By

## DEC. 84

defining 0=15 and 1=18 in the format statement, and using those characters in the compressed print can be text, turned on. Fortunately the print codes are transparent to the word processor software, and thus not printed. The command is received by the printer however.

The Epson printer requires two control codes from some print styles. For example, italics print requires &lt;ESC)"4". The decimal value of ‹ESC) is 27, and the value of "4" is 52. By defining both 27 and 52 in the format, and using the two corresponding characters you have assigned, іП series, the command will be received by the printer. For example, if you define 0=27:1=52 in the format statement, then the characters 10 11 are inserted in the text where emphasized print is to begin. A similar command is required to turn it off-

There are complications which you may encounter. As can be seen in examples above, the WORDPRO 3 software has problems when fancy prints are used and the text is " right justified. Margin over-runs can occur on expanded print. A150, problems occur when centering text on a line. The software does not change spacing as you change print styles. Another problem could occur when using special graphic characters. Consult your printer and interface instructions as needed.

Refer to your printer instruction manual for the ASCII codes used by that particular device.

## COMAL UPDATE T. S. Creasy

Two days before this article was due I received my CONAL 2.0 cartridge. haven't had much time to work with it, but I have already formed some opinions. First, its great! Several packages are included in the cartridge. A package is an enhancement to standard COMAL that makes 1t more useful to a specific computer. (You can write packages procedures and use them without really that they coMAL the packages included are: part of

Procedures WINDOW, DRAW, PLOT, TEXTSTYLE, TURTLESIZE, PRINTSCREEN (a BUILT-IN, 5-grey scale, dump for Commodore and emulating printers) A windowing environment 18 supported (11ke Macintosh).

SYSTEM - Controls the interaction of CONAL with the computers hardware. keys(default definitions are in place on set up printer specifications (great for emulating printers), real-time clock (disk and tape I/O don't upset the real-time clock!), and switch screens with ease.

logo-type package, must be used with GRAPHICS package.

FONT - Procedures setup and apply custom character sets.

SPRITES - Procedures include DEFINE, SHOWSPRITE, SPRITECOLOR, SAVESHAPE, STAMPSPRITE (draws screen, good to control language, separate You can set up a sprite an have without further control. Colin Thompson wrote many of the demo programs, sprite, graphics, and music demo that 1s most impressive.

SOUND - Sound can be COMAL or by PLAYSCORE, a music control language. COMAL can run Independently of background music.

There are other features such as an screen editor is still in never 11ked quote mode (wherein characters such as reversed the like are printed when typing after quote) you can turn it off. and CHANGE is part of the system.

## Function Keys

set function keys 18 now available that include the 8 function keys and control keys; for example, CTRL " removes the Indentationg of a LISTed line so it can be edited. CTRL-P dumps the text screen to the printer! The neat thing 1s that although CTRL A to Z are avallable, only 13 have been predefined. The system package that defines the function keys also defines control keys. Now the C64 has 34 TRUE function (My immediate favorite 1s 17, keys. RUN. you get a disk directory and place cursor the beginning of the line press 17, run.) the program will load the and and

## The BAD News

There is no apparent way to use a second disk drive with COMAL 2.0, but this may be from the lack of documentation. LOAD "program", 9 Wi11 not work; neither will SAVE or CHAIN. But strangely enough PASS will now initialize drive 9 although It wouldn't in the 0.14 version. Thig hints that multiple disk use 1s possible. The only documentation that Came with the cartridge was 12 photocopled pages of dot matrix print-out. Len Lindsey sent a note that the book would be out in a couple of weeks. The delay may be tied to the multiple trips to Denmark that have been necessary the last few months.

Finally, about the cartridge. The system 1s to crash. Il you don't have areset switch on your 64 you will get one. Requesting several disk catalogs in row when pattern matching will crash the machine. Also, interrupting animated sprites and sound can upset COMAL 2.0 as well.

The Coetday Coler my cartridge arrived I received a letter concerning cartridge and its future Commodore has apparently decided once and for all to ignore CONAL here. The COMAL USERS GROUP, U.S.A (CUG) will be the only source. Mr. Lindsey in Denmark distribution agreement. cartridge can only is trying distribution rights Target, Videoland, etc. can sell cartridges.

has increased from $100 to The cartrige alone 1s still $100, the price of manuals and demo-disks available, not 500 as last reported; received indicates that I have cartridge #60 (because my last name begins with "C"1?) so you can possibly get one before the end of this year. CUG hints at price increase next year, though moving production from Denmark to Honk Kong (as well as changing from EPROM to ROM) could dramatically reduce the cost of a cartridge.

Hordprocessing and COMAL, Part 1

The benefits of wordprocessors don't articles. Many computers systems wordprocessors (1ike search and COMAL makes this possible Besides writing new programs, It makes things much easier when you try to adapt a lavorite BASIC program to COMAL. The system I use is Gazette's SPEEDSCRIPT and CONVERT64 programs. accomplish the transfer you have to the BASIC progxam to the

## (Be sure you're in BASIC 2.0)

LOAD " program name " ,8 OPEN 8,8,8, "O: prg name . blt, s, w". CND 8: LIST (When the listing has finished) PRINT#8: CLOSE 8

Now you have a sequential version of your BASIC program. CONVERT64 program to process for SPEEDSCRIPT. Now you can Use the clean 11le the file up the program.

The first thing you should do is. substitute long variable names lor the short names 01 BASIC. This makes much more readable. Just use the thingg search command to find each use of the old variable name and type in its new name. Also you should fix the integer sign. In BASIC an integer is designated by the % symbol. You must change this to a # to be compatible with COMAL. GOTO and GOSUB will be major problems. GOTO is the easiest since it is still allowed in COMAL. However, ·it doesn't use line numbers, instead you must name the branch. If you can figure out why the branch was made you can give it a nice descriptive name 11ke PRINT' MENU'TO'DISPLAY. Otherwise you can give it name like FIRST' BRANCH' I 'DON'T' UNDERSTAND. GOTO names are placed on a line alone like this:

## FIRST' BRANCH' I 'DON'T' UNDERSTAND:

GOSUB is where the crisis starts. Since procedures are used in COMAL you have to change quite Iew things. First, find a GOSUB call with the Find option of the wordprocessor. Then make . the GOSUB call a COMAL remark like this:

## 30 IF V$="'TED" THEN //GOSUB. 200

The two slashes make anything follows them a REMark. Now that find line 200. You will then add COMAL statements to create a procedure.

PROC PRINT' NAME //COMAL 200 PRINT "THE NAME IS "+V$ 210 //RETURN ENDPROC

## DEC. 84

Notice that there are no line numbers on the COMAL lines. They aren't required by CONAL during a run; we. will add them later. Now that you've given the subroutine a name, you should use the name at every call; for example:

## 30. IF V$="TED" THEN PRINT' NAME //GOSUB 200

Now search for all GOSUB 200 calls and use the procedure name instead. For BASIC conversions I use open since all BASIC variables procedures are global; that is, N$ means the same variable throughout the entire program.

The rest of the conversion follows in this pattern, however, a really sloppy program with GOTO's and GOSUB' s within other GOTO's and GOSUB' s may be impossible to convert without careful analysis of what the program does, for example:

190 REM SUBROUTINE ALPHA 200 PRINT "NAME "+V$ 210 IF V$="TED" GOTO1000:REN EXIT2 220 RETURN 1000 REM EXIT2 FROM SUBROUTINE 1010 PRINT "HI TED" 1020 RETURN

This would be difficult to convert 11 wasn't simple enough to understand. Confusing programs might be easier to write from scratch in COMAL.

Next month I will present a program that will take the new version of your BASIC program, strip off the old BASIC line numbers and renumber it for COMAL.

## The Confusing Library Disk

On one of the COMAL disks! I placed in the NCCC library were some confusing files. Most of the PRG files are COMAL programs and can be LOADed and RUN. However some of the files are WORDPRO files. These are the "Learning Comal" files. You need WORDPRO or SPEEDSCRIPT to look at them. Also some the files may be LISTed programs. Use SEQ ENTER " Ille name " to load them into COMAL. If you get a lot of errors during the ENTER, the SEQ İlle 1s probably a data Ille. The file name conventions recommended are:

• com - 0.14 COMAL PRG file • c20 - 2.00 COMAL PRG file • bas basic PRG file • blt basic SEQ program file • Ist COMAL SEQ program file • WOr - WORDPRO file • spd SPEEDSCRIPT file • doc or txt - ascil text file

I'll try to from this point. use them consistantly

## GHOSTBUSTERS SPACE SHUTTLE Two Activision Reviews

Space Shuttle another great game by Activision? NO!

On the outside Space Shuttle like an "easy to play" and fun game reminiscent of the flight simulator style. After thumbing through the 30-plus pages in the flight manual, 1 learned it would be quite some time before I got off the ground with this game. When I finally sifted through all the technical material, I found out how to start the game.

Space Shuttle consists mainly of three parts, 1) Takeoff, 2) Docking with a satellite and 3) Returning to Earth. Although very realistic. this game is hard to master and is burdened instructions by and many slow movement.

just don't think Space Shuttle will "fly' with the majority of game lovers. If you like Activision games, you'11 love Ghostbusters!

"Who ya gonna call?...GHOSTBUSTERS!"

The game starts with the usual Activision title into the Ghostbusters' theme song complete with · bouncing ball sing-along. The music is some of the best yet and adds a lot as it continues to play throughout the game.

When I first heard that there was a game for the 64 called "Ghostbusters", I was skeptical. Activision software has many good games on the market, however, they currently do not have a game in the top ten or one that sticks out in s crowd. Then, here comes Ghostbusters.

Ghostbusters is loosely based on the movie and is quite different from arcade-style shoot 'ат ирб. given a loan from the bank to start your own company. You then purchase your car from choices, select your equipment, and load it to your car with a forklift. to pick up your helpers.

During the game you travel the streets freezing "roamers' as you look for indications of a 'slimer' that you must catch using your special guns and traps. As you drive to the site, you are obliged to vacuum the 'roamers' lest the the forming of city be damaged by a 'marshmallow man' whose destruction is deducted from your profit. The object of the game is to capture slimers which earns you money, travel to Zuul, slip 2 men through the door and reach the top of the temple. All this must be accomplished before the keymaster meets the gatekeeper, a catastrophe that will dissolve your business.

Ghostbusters is without a doubt the best game I've seen in a long time. It has all the attributes of a great game including a very special bonus; it talks to you and does it very well.

Ghostbusters for $31.95 available at Babbage's for $27.15. We would like thank Babbage's for loaning us the best software in town.

## PUZZLE ANSWERS Don Ketchun 77999

California Terminal (CACTUS) Area Commodore Users Society

Here is last month's program and an explanation of why it works.

10 FOR A=1TO-1STEPO

20 B=B+1

30 PRINT B

40 A=B=5

50 NEXT A

When you the program it prints the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, in one column and then stops. The key to what happens is in line 40 A = B = 5 which probably looks strange to most of youOn some computers this statement would mean that both A and Bare get to 5 but not on a Commodore.

In IF... THEN statement the expression between IF and THEN has possibility of being true or false. If it is true the computer gives it a value of -1 and if it is false it is given a value of zero. When it has a value of zero, the computer ignores the statement following THEN. When it has a value of -1 for any other value) the computer executes the statement following THEN.

test these ideas type in this program.

10 INPUT B

20 IF B THEN PRINT B

30 IF B=9 THEN END

40 GOTO 10

RUN the program and you will find that value of B except zero the IF statement will cause the value of B to be printed. zero PRINT B after THEN will be ignored. If B is given a value 9. it will be printed then the IF statement of line 30 will end the program. Now change line 20 to:

20 PRINT B=5

and RUN the program. You will find that for any value of g except 5 line 20 will print zero. When B is 5 line 20 will print -1. Again, when B is 9, line 30 will end the program.

NOW, back to the program from last month. In line 40 the statement could be taken as A = (B=5) where A has a value of -1 when B=5 and A has a value of zero other value of B. The FOR statement in line 10 does not let A change in value because of the STEF 0. Line 20 changes the value of Beach time through the loop so line 30 prints a mew value of B each time. In line 40, A has a value of zero for each value of other. than 5 the FOR... NEXT 100p continues because it is looking for A having a value of -1 to end the loop. When B finally gets to 5, A then equals -1 and the loop and program are ended.

By following several simple rules you can avoid many costly repairs. Here are a few tips.

1. Never insert or plug anything to your machine while it is one

2. Do not leave the computer plugged into wall socket when not in use. I have been asked to repair several machines that were plugged in during an electrical storm. Needless to says: there was not much I could do.

3. When using peripherals, always turn on the machine first, then one item at a time. Remember, the machine is first - one last off.

4. If you are using the · Commodore cassette, cut the useless ground wire off. It has found its into computers and way shorted out supply voltages more than once.

5. Although you owna machine that is "state of the art", they are still subject to destruction by static. Do not handle them unless you have the proper tools.

· The most common problems I have run across are:

Blue or Blank Screen This is caused by one of two things:

1. Loss of voltage due to bad power supply or blown fuse. Fuse replacement is simple and can be done by almost anyone.

2. This several The computer's inability to "power up". can be caused by things shorted

For the most part the machines are very reliable and most problems are caused by normal wear and tear.

In only six short (but fun-fllled) months, COMAL has aught on acroas the countr ther language before it. I've found that most people require three months to bacone acclimitized to the COMAL earironsent before vriting a progras. That's fair. I now expect it. In the last six monthe COMAL has attracted the Interest of hundreda of good prograsmera, all looking for a creatire outlet for their imagination. Prograns are being vritten. All kinds of prograns. It reminda ne of the early days of the Petso much to write, a0 little time. Some people re-write their favorite BASIC programs into COMAL while others concentrate on the kinda of programs that CorAL alone will execute. Regardless of the nature of the programs, many COMAL programs now exist and more are being written each day. That's good neve. You nay be asking yourself, hands on these programs"? "How do I get sy

The COMAL TODAY DISKS are alsad at a different audience. These diaka feature more advanced progreas. Applicationa programs, PROCS, utilities, Machine Language and of courae a few Demos will be found on the COMAL TODAY d1aka. It'a hoped that whaterer your level of experience, there is a series of diska availeble for your enjoyment.

Where do all these progreas cone from? You and your frienda, of course. Although I've vritten a fow dozen COMAL programo, I can't expect to fill up the Uner Group Diake all by ayself, eo I' send ne your programe. Bif or aaall, uneful or frivoloua, unique or sodified, I don't care, Just send them in. Your programs wil1 be reworked or debugged if necessary and then assigned to a COMAL TODAY or User Group diak. diakette you send will be returned with the latest disk of your choice recorded on It. That'a a fair trade. You send ne one program and I send you back 50 or more on your diakette. By the end of the year, ve should have assased a large body of public domain COMAL programs, available to all through the COMAL User Group or your local club'a 1lbrary.. Remember that these disks may be copied and added to your library. There are some legal restrictions gorerning the resale of COMAL diake by indiriduala for profit, so 1f you want to sell the write to the COMAL Users Group for information about licenaing.

User Group Disks f1, 2, &amp; 3 are now available. You may send your COMAL programa directly to me or to the COMAL Uners Group, but either way, I'11 receive them for procesaing. When you send in a disk, please nake it eaay for me to proceas your disk. Just follow this outline and all vill go well:

If you sake it gany for se, I can put out more diake each month. The Important thing to remember is you don't have to be a programming visard to write a niity COMAL progran. Some of the prograns os the User Group Diake are 'firat prog. rans'. I hope they encourage you, Short prograns are just as good as long ones. Special purpose prograns can be modifiad into a satisfactory Deno. Pleane don't ait on a progres. Let se see it.

If ve all cooperate in thio joint adventure, ve should have 20 Uper Group Dake by this apring. Hon that's a goal worth shooting for!
