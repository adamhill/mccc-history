## BOARD MEETING

The February Board of Directors meeting was held February 4 at the Hurst Recreation Center. President Diane Dews called the meeting to order and welcomed 14 visitors.

The first item on the agenda concerned incorporation. Mike Cramer reported that the club currently is in a partnership status.| If for some reason the club were to be sued, all members would be liable. The benefits to incorporating are numerous. Mike estimated that the filing fees for incorporating as a not-forprofit organization would be not more than $450 Ken Widner made a motion that we present to the membership a proposal to spend not more than $450 to incorporate. The motion was approved by the Board. Garry Wordelman then noted that we should also look into liability insurance. The Board will investigate this and report back at the March 3 meeting.

It was suggested that at the April club meeting we have a series of short courses available as we did last year. Diane announced that the MCCC will have a table set up at the TCJC Computer

Fair on Thursday, February 9, between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.

Treasurer Bruce Nelson reported that the effective balance of the club treasury stands at $3,892. He also announced that the price of diskettes which the club sells will go up $2 a box to help cover the costs of incorporating.

There was a general discussion of bulk purchases by the club for items such as printer paper and mailers. The Board also discussed various procedures for the librarians and decided to adopt a rate structure as proposed by Leonard Parker. Each of the board members signed a copy of the constitution and the meeting adjourned to discuss formation of the new chapters.

## CLUB NEWS

The club is in need of a Certified Public Accountant to help Bruce Nelson prepare the club's tax return.

We are looking for ideas and volunteers for workshop topics for the next MCCC meeting in April.

The next Board of Directors meeting will be held March 3 at the Hurst Recreation Center on Mary Drive at 10 AM. Members are encouraged to attend.

Anyone interested in working with COBOL please call Gary Blocker at 838-6252.

The deadline for articles, want ads, news items, etc. will always be day following the Board of Directors meeting. We are happy to include items of interest, as space allows. The deadline for next month will be March 4.

## DEMINI: 1OZ PAINTER CODES

## By STEVE STOCKDALE

This list of GEMINI 10X codes is, obviously, for the GEMINI 10X. However, if you have a different printer you might still learn how to use the similar codes for your printer. The first column lists the function and the second lists the character string (CHR$) codes which have to be sent to get the desired function. The list contains what I believe to be the most useful codes. If you aren't familiar with these, note the following points.

1. The codes should be sent to the printer after the printer channel is opened. Use the PRINT command. For example, to set up your printer with pica pitch (10 char/inch), emphasized mode, left margin of 10 and right margin of 70, do this (with a RETURN after each):
2. CHR$ (27) is referred to as the ESCape code. This code is to be sent prior to many of the printer codes.
3. Some of the functions require you to enter variable parameters. To set the number of lines per page, length of page in inches, vertical or horizontal tabs, and left and right margins, you must enter the desired values after the appropriate CHR* codes. (See the previous example for margins.)
4. If you are writing a program and know you'll be using some printer codes quite a bit, it's a good technique to define the CHR$ codes you"ll be using early in the program.

Open Channel

Set Pitch

Emphasized Mode

Lt Margin

Rt Margin
```basic
OPEN 4, 4: CMD 4

PRINT CHR$ (27) CHR$ (66) CHR$ (1)

PRINT CHR$ (27) CHR# (69)

PRINT CHR$ (27) CHR# (77) CHR$ (10)

PRINT CHR$ (27) CHR$ (81) CHR$ (70)

| LF$=CHR$ (10) EO$=CHR$ (27) +CHR# (69) EF$=CHR$ (27) +CHR$ (70) TB$=CHR$ (9)   | (Line Feed) (Emphasize ON) (EmphasizeOFF) (Horizontal Feed)   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
```

Later in your program (after you've opened the printer channel), all you'll need to do to send a line feed is: PRINT LF$.

5. Remember that when you send a code to the printer, the printer will remain in that configuration until a different code is sent which cancels the previous code or until the printer is turned off. For example, say you want to list a favorite program on half a sheet of paper with 12 characters/inch. You would load the program into memory, then, in direct mode, type in:
```basic
OPEN 4, 4: CMD 4 (Open Printer) PRINT CHR$ (27) CHR$ (66) CHR$ (2) (12 char/inch) PRINT CHR$ (27) CHR$ (81) CHR$ (48) (Rt margin 48) LIST
``
The program listing would then print out on the printer. When complete, you'd want to re-. configure the printer back to its default settings and close the printer channel:

PRINT#4: CLOSE4

6. There are other printer codes in your printer manual. Play around with them so that you'll be in control of your printer - not viceversa.

Editor's Note

If you find that this proceedure does not work for you, check the manual for the interface that you are using. If you are using "The Connection" (a parallel interface) by Tymac, you will need to use a secondary address in your open statement. Type - OPEN 4,4,6: CMD 4 - and your printer will do precisely what Steve has indicated.

I was also pleased to find out proceedure that this works beautifully with a word processor. Simply set up the printer to your specifications and then load in the word processor.
