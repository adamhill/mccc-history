## 1600% Growth

Donald Holloway. is our 500th member. And we're still growing!

In February of 1983, thirty people got together to share information about their computers. Thanks to Garry Wordelman and that handful of Commodore owners the Mid-Cities Commodore Club was born. In the past 18 months, the club has seen an incredible growth causing the formation of four area chapters.

Keeping a club of this size running smoothly is not an easy job. Next time you see a club or chapter officer, be sure to thank him or her for all the unseen hours of work. We've reached the 500 mark due to the dedication of all those who have volunteered time and service. Spread the word. We're proud of our club and we're especially proud of the people who have contributed to its sucess.

## NEWSLETTER GETS BETTER

Keeping pace with the growth of the club has made it necessary to update the format of your newsletter. Many of you have requested a return to the larger format. We have now made arrangements with the printer to keep the cost of this improvement equal to the cost of previous issues. Thank you for your praise and criticism of the newsletter. We are constantly striving to meet your needs and improve the quality of our publication.

You mav have noticed the newsletter looks a little different this month. This is due to the efforts of Barbara Cramer. Barbara is constantly improving the newsletter and we really appreciate the care and expertise she has brought to her job this year.

The club will be purchasing Comal Primer and Handbook from T-PUG which will be made available for purchase to the members. A count will be taken at the chapter meetings of those members interested in purchasing a copy. We will have few copies of the book at the October meeting for you to examine.

I have been pleased to note the continued co-operation between the MCCC and other user groups from Maine to California. Their willingness to share information has resulted in some excellent and interesting articles being printed in our own newsletter.

I want to encourage any member of the MCCC to submit articles to our editors for publication. Who knows... you may be published nationwide.

Don't forget our contest (See back page). Your participation will assure us of a sucessful event and add to our library.

## Comal 2.0

Colin Thompson

A letter from Colin Thompson

## The future of the COMAL Cartridge is in your hands.

More than one hundred members of my group have seen my COMAL 2.0 cartridge. Every one was impressed. I know. They told me in glowing terms. They asked me two questions: "How much?" and "When will it be out?".

How would you feel if I told you that Commodore is not going to release the cartridge in the U.S. because they think it won't be popular? That's exactly what's happening. Commodore is selling the cartridges to a packed house in Europe, but witholding it here. It's not fair. but it is typical of Commodore. Tramiel is gone but his legacy of footdragging lives on.

There is one thing we can do. Please pay attention even if you haven't been seduced by COMAL.

## WRITE A LETTER

The man responsible for the decision to release COMAL is PAUL GOHEEN. Goheen actually likes COMAL, but doesn't think the American public will appreciate a language that the Europeans use. (?) At the MARCA show in Hershey. PA he said he would release COMAL if he received 3,000 letters.

I think Mr. Goheen's mailbag needs to be filled. We all have wordprocessors. Let's put them to work. Everyone, please, even if you haven't seen the cartridge, write Mr. Goheen a letter, note or anything you like. Just put something on his desk that says,

"I WANT COMAL. "

you want printed at 5 CPI and &lt;F1&gt; 2 when you want to change back to normal size print.

Reprinted from S C Cubed Sacramento Commodore Computer Club

For those of you like myself who have a non-Commodore printer hooked up to your Commodore 64 or VIC 20 using a Tymac Connection interface and also happen to be using the Commodore Easyscript wordprocessor, you may have found that certain of the fancier printing options don't seem to work in the emulate mode. I have a NEC 8023A-C printer that I am controling through the C-ITOH ROM so my examples will be more specific · to this combination but hopefully general enough to apply to other combinations as well.

After much reading in the manuals which came with my interface and printer, I had figured out how to accomplish just about anything I wanted to do with the printer from within program I had written myself. However, I just couldn't seem · to get the same results from within the Easyscript word processor. The Easyscript manual just didn't seem to be talking the same language as the other two manuals.

After much searching and experimenting I finally came up with the following solutions on how to make Easyscript talk to the Tymac Connection interface and my printer.

If you are trying to send a command to the interface to get some special feature that it can provide, like 5 CPI print, you have to define the special ASCII characters somewhere near the top of your document as follows:

&lt;F3&gt; I=14 (for Hexidecimal E) which enables 5 CPI print. If you want to be able to turn 5 CPI printing off, you will also need, &lt;F3) 2=15 (for a Hexidecimal F).

Once these special characters have been defined, they can be implemented by using &lt;F1&gt; 1 immediately proceeding the text to ten special ASCII values can be defined and used in this way (0-9).

If, on the other hand, you are trying I to send a command to the printer, you must temporarily force the interface out of the emulate mode so that it will let your control modes go on to the printer. The interface manual says you can do this by sending two escape codes in succession to the interface. However, there didn't seem to be any way to do this from within Easyscript.

So I decided to try another method for changing to the transparent mode while in Easyscript and then reverting back to the emulate mode when I was through with my fancy printing. Going into transparent mode was accomplished by sending ti following secondary address in front of the decimal values representing the appropriate control code hexadecimal values:

&lt;F3&gt; sab, 27,33

F3 is the Easyscript key that signifies 1a formatting command. The SA6 signifies the secondary address used in an open or print command (i.e., open 4.4.6). This tells the Tymac Connection to go into the transparent mode. The decimal value 27 is equivalent to the hexidecimal value 18 lan ASCII escape codewhich is the code that normally proceeds any commands to the printer. The decimal 33 is the equivalent of hexadecimal 21 which is an ASCII "!' and tells the NEC printer to print in the enhanced mode.

There was no need to tell the interface to revert back to emulate mode because Easyscript seems to automatically change back whether you are ready or not.

For those of you who are not familiar with converting hexidecimal values to their decimal equivalent, the following table may help.

|    | = 11   |                 | BO = 176        |
|    | = 12   |                 | CO = 192        |
|    | = 13   |                 | DO = 208        |

|    | F = 15 |                 | FO = 240        |

As an example of how to use this table take an ASCII lower case "a'. This has a hexidecimal value of 31: By splitting this value into parts we produce a 30 and a 1. Looking these up in our table we find decimal values of 48 and 1. Adding these back together we come up with lecimal value of 49 for a lower case 'a'.

A Review

Barbara Cramer

I had no idea ownirig a modem was SC exciting until I began reviewing HESMODEM II. This auto modem and software package is the latest in telecommunications from HesWare (Human Engineered Software). The program is so effortless that reading the manual is almost unecessary!

The main menu of HESTERM II gives you the option of modem, buffer, phonebook or disk operations as well as the option to change system presets. The phonebook allows 10 pieces of information, including parameters and password, on each of 20 entries. Disk and buffer operations are fairly standard, formatting, saving etc.

The modem operations are by far the most useful features of the package. You may auto dial using either the keyboard or the phone book. If no answer is received the program will continue to dial the number until an answer is received or you interrupt the at the keyboard. When you are "on-line" the function keys provide you with 8 one stroke commands:

- F1 Toggles receive buffer on/off
- F2 Saves buffer to disk
- F3 Toggles between full and half duplex
- F4 Transmits pass word
- F5 Toggles left justify (format) on/off
- F6 Opens disk command channel
- F7 View buffer/Return to on-line
- F8 Print buffer/Return to on-line.

Need I say more? This package is super! HESMODEM II &amp; HESTERM II (package) HesWare 150 North Hill Drive Brisbane: CA 94005 Retail Price: $119.95

HESMODEM II &amp; HESTERM II is available at Babbage's for $101.95. I would like to thank Babbage's for providing this package for review. However, they will probably be thanking me when they find out I am purchasing it! It's outstanding.

## Comal Update Terry Creasy

Last month we took a look at the differences between OPEN and CLOSED procedures in COMAL. This time we'll study how parameters passed from procedures, why closed procedures are preferrable to open ones.

## Passing Parameters

Variable data is passed to a procedure or function in a parameter list. When the procedure is defined the parameters it will expect are listed in parenthesis:

proc examplelfirst, second, ref text#)

This procedure will expect three parameters to be passed to it when it is called:

example (data, datab, string$)

If any of the values are missing, or should you try to pass more values than are in the list, an error will occur.

There are two ways to pass variables to a procedure function: the first transfers values and strings to new variable names.

neW

auto

0010 //program:

0020 value'one: =7

0030 value'two:= operation (value' one) // call Function

0040 zone 2 I/ set spacing for print:

0050 print value'one, value'two

0060 end

0070 // function

0080 func operation (number) closed

0090 number:=number*2 // double the number

- 0100 return number
- 0110 endfunc

0120 PRESS RETURN

ruIn

7. 14

end at line 0060

When the function OPERATION is executed, the variable NUMBER is set equal to VALUE'ONE, which in this case is seven. NUMBER is doubled and then RETURNed to the main program as variable VALUE TWO, Notice that VALUE'ONE is unchanged. This can be illustrated as:

OUTSIDE PROC value'one

INSIDE PROC number

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

value'two number

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Each variable refers to its own memory location for storing its data. When the procedure is called, the new variable names are given space in memory and equal to the variables outside of the procedure. In the case of functions. the numeric result is sent back to the calling statement by the RETURN (in line 100). Functions cannot return string data. You must either use a global string or use the reference option in the parameter list.

The reference option for passing variables works like this:

## new

auto

0020 dim string'onet of 40, string' two of 40

0010 // program:

0030 string' one$: ="KAY"

0040 string' change(string' one$, string "two#)

0050 zone 2 // set spacing for print:

0070 end

0060 print string'ones, string'two$

0080 // procedure

0100 data'$: data'$+data' $

0090 proc string' change(ref data'$, datb#) closed

0110 datb#: = data'$+"SISTER"

0130 PRESS RETURN

0120 endproc

![Image](1984_09_artifacts/image_000010_68d3b66524d324c1c8f1383f7584deadb9ae491f91cc229ce96c89859ec379b1.png)

FLIn KAYKAY KAYKAYSISTER

In this case STRING ONE$ is changed to "KAYKAY" and STRING' TWO$ becomes "KAYKAYSISTER" yet we didn't use an equate (:=) on these variables. The REF in the procedure definition sets · the procedure to use the strings that are already dimensioned, or:

![Image](1984_09_artifacts/image_000011_1d90d67dfca8746541e733c1739d7db09a54dbebecb00bdfb6feaf9939f75932.png)

![Image](1984_09_artifacts/image_000012_a4ce32623ce259029c4638c15ecb27b30950852c3733f311934ef7f42ace3f41.png)

0070 closed proc(value one, string'a#) 0080 zone 2

0090 print value'one, value'two

0100 print string'a$, string'b*

0110 end

- 0120 |/ procedure:

- 0130 proc closed' proc (value' one, ref text#) closed

- 0140 value'one:tvalue one //add to itself

- 0150 text#:="PROCEDURE EXEC'D"

- 0160 print value one

- 0170 endproc

- 0180 PRESS RETURN

run

14

7 9

PROCEDURE EXEC'D OUTSIDE B

Both inside and outside of the procedure -efer to the same memory locations, but with different names! The value of the variable is still accessible outside when the procedure is finished as long as the outside name is used.

## Why Closed Procedures?

If we have to go through some effort to pass data to and from a closed procedure or function, why write closed procedures? Well, the main reason is that closed procedures save time and effort in writing new programs. have written a procedure that works, you can save it (LIST "PROCEDURE. L") as sequential file that can be merged (ENTER "PROCEDURE.L) with any program you write in the future. Since the procedure is closed you don't have to struggle with rewriting it to avoid conflicts with variable names. For example:

## new

auto

0010 //program:

020 value " one: =7

0030 value'two: =9

0040 dim string'as of 40, string'b$ of 40

0060 string b$: = "OUTSIDE B"

0050 string' af: = "OUTSIDE A"

There is no conflict with the variable name VALUE'ONE, outside of the procedure: it is unchanged. In this case I wanted the string to be permanently changed by the procedure yet I didn't name I might use for the string; so I used a designator parameter list. Finally, by closing the procedure, I have made it certain that no other variables in the main program are affected by the procedure.

The power of procedural programming makes it easier to write new programs based or earlier ones. You can use these structures enhance the language in any way you desire. One of the best ways to learn about procedures is · to study real procedures perform operations. The COMAL has many programs from which you may learn.

## Board Report

The Board of Directors meeting was held Sept. 1 at the Hurst Recreation Center.

TPUG has offered to provide . a COMAL Primer and Manual at a reduced price $6.95 each. The Board elected to buy of the disk/manual packages. One of the manuals will be provided to each chapter so their members can examine the text at chapter meetings.

It was decided that contest judges will be selected by the chapters plus one from the executive board. Garry Wordelman will represent the executive committee making a total of five judges.

It was decided that a slate of nominees: for the 1985 ..officers needs to be provided to the club members at the: October quarterly meeting. Those interested in serving on the board should contact their chapter president. The board recommended that chapters take steps to insure their new officers are elected prior to the club's January quarterly meeting.

The board voted to pay for room expenses incurred by the Arlington chapter in order to provide an introductory train program for all club members. (see announcement on page 9.)

There being no further business. the meetino was adjorned.

QUESTION: Not very long ago I had very few programs for the 64. Now I seem to have hundreds and I am beginning to 1ose track of what they do. I routinely get a printout of the directory of each disk, but the names of the programs are usually so concise that I can't remember what the programs do, without loading and running them. I am about to tidy up my disk collection - do you have any suggestions?

ANSWER: Yes, at least as far as BASIC programs are concerned. Next time you : type in a program start with some REM statements which contain enough information to identify the program. For example, these might include description of what the program does, Does, when written, where typed from, where instructions can be found, who wrote it or who gave it to you. Then months later when you see a program with a title like PROPS on your disk, you can load and run the following little program. It will the REM statements at the beginning of the program and print them on screen. It is much faster than loading the entire program called PROPS.

- 100 REM THIS PROGRAM READS REM STATEMENTS
- 105 REM AT THE START OF A PROGRAM
- 120 OPENS, 8, 8, N$ + ",P,R"
- 110 INPUT "PROGRAM NAME?": N$

130 FOR I=1TO2 : GET#8, A$ : NEXT

- 150 GET#8, A*

140 FOR I=1T04 : GET#8, A$ : NEXT

- 155 IFA#&lt;&gt;CHR$(143) THEN 999
- 160 GET#8,A$ : A=ASC (AtCHR$ 10))
- 170 IF A=0 THEN 140

Thanks to Charles Hinkley for the program on genealogy which he gave at the August meeting. I know that it held the interest of even those who had previously had dealings in genealogy. He shared with us his own experiences in tracing his family tree, and showed how available computer programs could simplify the job.

The subject of the September meeting will be music programs. Ray Montoro of the Arlington branch has agreed to give it, after being asked by Mary Louise Hagemeyer, who saw him give it at the Arlington meeting. Her comments on it were very favorible, so everyone should try to make it. The meeting, by the way, will be delayed one week due to a schedule conflict for the meeting room. It will be held as usual in meeting 2 in the club house at General Dynamics Recreation Center, September 22, 1:30. there will be an evening meeting Also, the 17th, 7:00, at the Precinct 1 Garage.

## Hi- Resolution Screen Dump

Reg Knighton

## FROM: COMMUNIQUE

Commodore 64 West User Group

One of the Commodore 64's most attractive assets is its powerful graphics. Sprites, high resolution and multicolor modes, programmable characters, etc. offer the C-64 programmer an inviting, expedient environment for generating high quality graphics software. As the software base for the C-64 matures, commercial developers, magazines like COMPUTE!, : newsletters, and users groups, all provide a : continuously increasing variety of applications, : utilities, tools, and the like.

With the capability that the C-64 offers through the software that is increasingly available, it is desirable to have some means of outputting graphic images to devices other than the CRT (i.e. printers, plotters, modems, etc.).

A program is offered here for use with the Gemini 10X dot-matrix printer. It has been tested successfully with the Cardco +6 interface. However, using other interfaces (or even other printers) should require little or no modification.

It is supplied as a BASIC program with a machine code subroutine that carries out the bulk of the screen dump task. To use this routine, follow these steps:

- 1) Type in the listing at the end of this article just as it appears then IMMEDIATELY save to disk with SAVE"HIREZ DUMP.BAS", 8 &lt;RTRN&gt;. This way, if it crashes due to a typing error, you have a copy you can edit rather than an entire listing to retype.
- 2) After SAVEing the program (step 1), type LOAD"HIREZ DUMP·BAS", 8 &lt;RTRN›
- 3) Pressing the first letter of an option on the menu will invoke that option:

Load: prompts you for a filename then loads the file from the disk drive into the C-64 at 8° ^ ($2000 hex), regardless of the file's norm address. This enables any program file to be LOADed and examined on the CRT as a bit-image and then, if desired, dumped to the Gemini 10X.

View: Switches from displaying the menu to displaying the bit-image of the file currently in the C-64. Pressing "y" returns you to the menu.

Margin: Prompts you for a value from O to 47. 25 centers the dump on the paper. Changing the Margin value moves the image left or right with respect to the paper. 0 is maximum left and 47 is maximum right.

Print: causes the printout to begin.

Reverse: Prints a reversed image. This is useful for digitized photographs that often appear "negative" with straight translation of pixel data.

One thing to be aware of: if you abort a printout and/or rerun the program, you must turn the Gemini off then back on to provide proper initialization. Otherwise, the first line printed out will garbage.

The program is on diskette in the club library. Contact Mark Preston.
