How many times have you written a program that required output to the screen to be putat certain location? Using cursor movements: is tedious and time consuming. This small subroutine takes care of the "print at statement that Commodore Basic does not have. You can then GOSUB this short routine to allow you to easily print statements anywhere on the screen. The screen is given X, y coordinates with the origin in the top? left-hand corner.

## Present's Column

It was great seeing evervone at the quarterly meeting. Despite its being Easter weekend, attendance was good. We had some very talented people involved in presenting the workshops. The response I received from the seabers was enthusiastic and aany said they would like to have this same format again.

All the paperwork has been completed and the Mid-Cities Comnodore Club is now incorporated. All that is necessary now, is to insure the club. We are taking bids through June !st for liability insurance.

We are still a few names short of having 25 subscriptions to T-PUG. If as many as 25 people subscribe to T-PUG through the club, the MCCC will receive a disk a aonth free froe T-PUG. Please give vour check, payable to MCCC to Bruce Nelson or a chapter officer on or before May 19.

l'a sure vou've noticed the newsletter has had a face-lift. This new look and they continue to improve the quality of our newsletter. Thank you is due to the hard work and creativity of our newsletter editor. Barbara Craner. The Craners have demonstrated that they can handle a tough job Barbara and Mike.

Most highly touted programs advertised in the magazines today loudly proclaim with great fanfare the many things they will do. Each new gimmick brings another full page Each eM proclamation in . living color. 'Marketing' is surely screaming for a slight edge on the competition!

The programs that will, in fact. do global this and global that are marvels in the eyes of the media. Down at the keyboard level these programs are quite often slow starters if you can get them to start st all.

The newcomer, encompassing many of us, needs a better place to begin. Since programs are not readily available in graduated complexity, an interim solution may help. At our house last summer the "COMPUTER' was greeted with great expectations. However, practical usage was slow to come.

My wife and daughter had been looking forward to typing documents-mainly personal letters-via the computer using ten chasters i the its printer. They soon learned that the rambling first few chapters of the manual for Wordfro/64 were hardly worth thumbing through each time a letter to Granny was needed. Digging out the commands again and again were just not worth it! I agreed wholeheartedly and sat down to the keyboard to come up with what became known as STD. PERSONAL LETTER format on a disk. The user loads Wordfro/64 then, using the Recall command, loads the format and proceeds to fill in the blanks in order to write a personal letter with minimum hassle. I have listed it below with the checkmark and left arrow symbols that are part of the commands in Wordpro/64.

Vcm: (note Itr to Granny, Easter 84) VIm12irm75:pp66:p960 ~ Vral(DATE) 2852 Oak Forest Grapevine, Texas 76051 vraoDear (Name) = dintijul (Begin your letter here.)

Note: " the end of each paragraph hit RETURN twice. To print y dr letter press CTRL then letter 0. then letter

Co then RETURN.

The first Sunday after this canned format was put to use my daughter used the three hours following Monday my wife put it to use. 90 fantastic program has been put to use TO THE EXTENT IT IS NEEDED. Now questions are being asked about expanding the use of the program. We STARTED SIMPLE.

Other snow jobs can be dealt with in a simmilar manner. Start a spreadsheet experience with PRACTICALC. When its limitations are observed expand to CALC RESULT (Pro) or MULTIPLAN. Begin a data base experience with EASY MAIL or DATA 64 and then graduate to FLEXFILE 2,1 or DELPHI's ORACLE. What is important is the user's feeling of SUCESS and ACCOMPLISHMENT. From there, moving to greater things is a piece of cake.

IT'S FUN (even with a 1525). 7

## MSD Drive Colin Thompson

Since the birth of the VIC 20, a new term has been placed into the vocabulary of the Commodore community: "Old Pet Peolpe". The term generally applies to anyone, regardless to age, that owned a Pet before the advent of mass marketed home computers. Old Pet People love to relate stories about their fabled dual disk drive, the venerable CBM 4040, few of these drives ever saw duty on these computers before the 4040 (and the PET) vanished into oblivion a few months ago.

Where does that leave the VIC/64 owner who wants the added power of a dual disk drive? In a good position, actually, because MSD has finally released their 4040 compatable dual drive.

The dual drive is called the Super Disk 2 or SD-2 for short. The primary issue you should be concerned with is DO I NEED IT? The answer may surprise you. The SD-2 has two mechanical disk drives inside the aluminum cabinet. The drives are vertically mounted, half height T.E.C. (Tokyo Electronics Corporation) units. The SD-2 is about an inch and a half wider than its single drive brother, the SD-1, so it will fit into the same space as a 1541 on your desk.

You should be interested in the SD-2 if you CY wo disk disks or if you use software that can use drives. If you don't copy many disks or if you use single drive software, you probably won't be able to justify the extra $200 for the SD-2 over the SD-1.

If you are still with me, and think you might need the SD-2, things get very exciting from here on. I have a large library of public domain disk software and I like to make it available to my friends. Copying disks on a single drive, even the SD-1, takes about 20-25 minutes per disk, so my friends don't get as many disks as they 222253 should. The SD-2 ends that problem forever. It will copy a whole disk in 1 minute and 55 seconds, including formatting, without swapping disks. You don't need special software to copy disks on the SD-2. Whole disks are copied by the Duplicate command: OPENI, 8,15, "DO=1" . That's all you need to do and a couple of minutes later you have an exact duplicate. The Duplicate command will not duplicate a "copy protected" disk, so this will not be a tool for the pirate.

One other copying command is available. The COPY command will copy a single program or data file from one drive other. syntax is: OPEN1, 8, 15, "CO: filename=1: filename" .

The SD-2 responds as Device 8 on the serial bus. exactly like the 1541 or SD-1. If you want to access the second drive, you must deal with "unit numbers". In this case, Device 8 has two units (drives) called 0; and 1.. For example, to get the directory from drive 1, the right-side drive, you LOAD"$1:",8 . That specifies Unit #1 of Device 8. If you use the familiar LOAD"$",8 you will get back the drive directories from both drives.

The SD-2 is no faster or slower than the SD-1 or the 1541. It still uses the serial bus to transfer data to and from the computer. The exception is copying or duplicating. Then data is not sent to the computer, simply read from one disk and written to the other. The computer has nothing to do with this operation. The SD-2 CAN use the Commodore IEEE parallel interface. To do this you must buy an IEEE card and a cable (about $150). This will speed up loading and saving times by about three times.

There a. some good software packages that · will take advantage of a dual drive. Not many, but some. Most of these will work on two 1541's as Device 8 and 9. The SD-2 can be configured by a single command to be 8 and 9, not 0 and 1, so you can take advantage of the dual drive options. Flexfile, a database manager for the 64 will work with the SD-2 without modification. All of TOTL's software will work with two drives (889) also. If you are planning to buy the SD-2 to take advantage of better software, you should check with the software company to see if their programs will work.

Compatability problems are becoming fewer and fewer as software companies are beginning to find out that MSD is capturing a large share of the disk drive market. Most copy-protected commercial is being rewritten to be compatable with Super Disk. particular, Electronic Arts and Richvale, both makers of premium software, are making their products compatable.

The SD-2 is now being shipped in large should be available for bee for need quantities and less than "600. My personal opinion of the SD-2 is "sheer delight". I liked it so much I bought the drive MSD loaned me for review. As far as I'm concerned, a dual drive is the only way to fly. 7

## Propram Tool Valerie Kramer

If you program in BASIC on your Commodore 64 to any significant extent. vou should have some sort of programmers aide. POWER 64 is a good choice. It seems to work reliably and offers a wide range of functions. Here's a list of just some of its powers.

SCROLL - if for nothing else I love POWER for this. 1 can list a program and scroll back up beyond the top of the screen into the earlier lines of the program. turn around and scroll down off the bottom into later lines. easily restart at any line I mav want and scroll from there. Beautiful!

AUTO - automatic line numbering when you type programs. You so@pecify the starting line number and the increment.

DELETE - works just like the list command but deletes single lines or all lines in the given range.

RENUM - renumber your program or any part of it. You give the new starting line number and the increment.

LOCATE - /string/ will find all the lines in the program that contain the given string. Other options include finding only the next occurance or replacing the string with a different string.

iy produc slightly brighter colors than Kodachromes. Fuji film is a very nice film for getting bright colors. The use of a film will make it difficult to get the required slow shutter speeds. EXPLANATION: a. TV: screen scanned by a cathode ray at is the rate. 525 30 times per second to give the illusion of smooth motion. A camera shutter speed exceeding or close to 1/30 of a second will photograph a scan line therefore the need for a slow shutter speed.

- Do not use flash! The illumination for the photograph is from the screen, and only the screen.
- TV screen. the Turn out the room lights to get a meter reading and to take the photograph. Also, bracket your exposures. That is, take one according to your shot meter and then take a shot one f/stop over at and one f/stop under the indicated exposure.
5. Finally, watch for reflections in

## Video

- Commodore computers have cable output that del verd this video signaitinot The tor: that goes to a normal TV) into a video recorder, you can record this signal. To see the picture, feed the video signal from the video recorder into the TV. By recording the video signal fron your computer; you can:
1. Record the action from your. video games.
2. Add visuals to a video production
- such as a map, cartoon, or even animation using sprites.
3. Give a professional look to your tape by adding titles, credits, or even video written information.

Repeating Keys - POKE 650.128 makes all C-64 keys repeat, just like the cursor keys, POKE 650,127 disables repeat of all keys, including space and cursor. POKE 650,0 returns them to normal, which means that repeat is enabled on Space Bar. CRSR: UP/DOWN, CASR RT/LEFT and

INST/DEL keys.

Headings - Here's how you can make a heading at the beginning of a program when you list it.

O REM ""&lt;DELETEXRVS ONSTTTT&lt;RVS OFF&gt; now type the heading.

Debugging Tip - When you get an ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR

in data statementa, just put a temporary print statement between the READ and POKE statements, like this.

10 READ a: PRINT A: POKE I,A When you reach the ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR you know that the last value printed is the bad one. Then you can easily locate the problem and repair it, without searching through all the Data statements.

How Much Storage On A Floppy? - A byte is the elementary unit of computer: storage and can be thought of as equivalent to one character. A kilobyte or K i5, approximately 1000 bytes and a megabyte is approximately one million bytes. There are about 2000 characters on a double-spaced typewritten sheet of paper, so we could store all the information on such a page in about 2K bytes of memory. One floppy disk in a Commodore 1541 disk drive can hold about 175K bytes, or the equivalent of about 88 doubled-spaced typewritten pages. A "Hardisk" unit can store up to 10: megabytes of information or about two full copies of the Bible. 7

## 'Connection' News

If you are using Tynac's "The Connection" as a printer interface, and it is Version 1.5 or later, then it has capabilities that you probably are not aware of. The operating manuals supplied with these units until recently listed only five commands, i.e. D,F,1,N and 5. There are actually six aore comands which can be used. These are "p"-(Page), "D°-(Dump), "L°-(Linefeed), "T'-(Transparent), "*n"-(Lock), and M-(Macro).

The Page command is used to control the number of lines printed on each page. The syntax is: PRINT #1, Chr$ (27)"P*Chr$(n). The nuaber of lines on a page is given by n, and say have any value between 20 and 127. This function is turned off by sending n=0.

The Pu op conmand is a diagnostic tool that allows you to determine exactly what sent to the printer. The syntax is: Print#1, Chr$(27)*?* Numeric values of the codes are printed rather than the character or function. If, for example, we send the coanand

It will stay in the Dump node until the RESET switch is pushed.

PRINT#1, Chr$ (14) "HELLO* in the Duap aode the printer will respond with: &lt;014) &lt;072&gt; &lt;069) &lt;076&gt; &lt;076) &lt;079) &lt;013).

The Linefeed coanand is used to disable the autonatic linefeed which occurs for secondary addresses of 0,2,4 and 7. This is mainly of value when using a printer that does not have a DIP switch for disabling the auto linefeed and when using a progran that has little provision for sending commands to the printer. The syntax is: PRINT*1, Chr$(27)"L' This statesent can be used to toggle the "Linefeed" off and on,

The Transparent coamand gives an alternate method for using the transparent sode other than secondary address '6'. When PRINT#1, Chr$(27)"T" is sent, the interface will stay in that node until the RESET button is pushed.

An even more permanent way of putting the interface in the transparent sode or, for that aatter, in any other secondary address, is with the Lock command. When PRINT#1, Chr$(27) " *n* is sent to the interface, with n being any numeral between 0 and 8, the unit will remain in that secondary address until the power to the printer is turned off!

Macro is perhaps the nost useful new conmand of all. This allows you to define seldom used characters as standing for long connand sequences or strings. Each time the character is embedded in text, the whole sequence or string is inserted at that point. Special symbols fe.g. Greek letters, logos etc. could be defined using the dot addressable graphics of your printer. The fora of the Macro command is:

PRINT#1, Chr$ (27) *M"Chr$(n+1)*fttttt....t" where: f is a single FROM character or code

- t is a sequence of one or more TO characters or codes
- n is the total number of characters in the TO sequence.

Example: PRINT#1, Chr$ (27) Chr$(5) "7MCCC" Each time the % symbol is typed, the 'MCCC' will be substituted for it. More that one Macro can be defined but the total space available is 127 bytes where each Macro will use nt2 bytes. To clear the Macros, send PRINT#1, Chr$(27) *M"Chr$(0).

If you own The Connection and your user's manual does not mention the connands above, then you can get a 26 page supplesent by sending a request and a large 16" X 8"), stamped (37 cents), self addressed envelope to: Micro-Ware Distributing 1342-B Route 23 Butler, New Jersey 07405.

THE DATASETTE OF CASSETTE TAPE SYSTEM

1. Remove or tie back the ground wire on the plug. It is not needed and could cause a short on contact with some pins.
3. Use SHIFT RUN/STOP keys for default load.
2. The best load and save occur when used away from your TV or monitor.
4. The best cassette tape length is short 15-10 minutes). Tapes of 20-30 minutes are OK but require long search and rewind times. Tapes of 60 or more minutes are too long and not recommended.
5. Rewind tape and reset the counter before using the tape. Then record the start position and program name (3x5 cards work great). Always leave 10-20 counter space between programs or files.

## Comal Hints

T.S. Creasy

**CDMAL version 0.14 lacks some features 04 full implementation of the language. Luckily, many of these missing commands have been written as procedures and functions. Most are recorded on the COMAL disk. Take &amp; look arounds try running

**The procedural capabilities of COMAL allow you to add commands to the language yourself. Write a procedure and RUN it. Nothing will appear to happen; however, the procedure can be called from the keyboard just like a command. Try this examples

0010 PROC SQUARE (SIZE') CLOSED 0020 SETGRAPHIC O //HIGH RES 0030 HIDETURTLE //NO TURTLE IS VISIBLE 0040 REPEATS: =0 0050 REPEAT 0060 FORWARD SIZE' //ADVANCE SIZE' UNITS 0070 LEFT 90 //DEGREES 0080 REPEATS:+1 0090 UNTIL REPEATS=4

0100 ENDPROC SQUARE

First type AUTO and press returnt COMAL will number the lines for you. When you have. entered the procedure, press return again to stop the numbering. Now run the program. When the program stops, enter SQUARE(20) and press return. Square is now a keyword.

**Two conmands missing from COMAL are STR$ and VAL. These can be performed by the following procedure and functions they use the screen as file to achieve the conversions quickly with minimal programming. Note that STRING changes the pencolor to match the bäckground. This makes the operation invisible to the user.

```
I/VAL FU: TION //BASED VAL FUNCTION FROM THE !/COMAL NEWSLETTER 11 //THIS FUNCTION RETURNS THE //FLOATING POINT VALUE OF A //STRING BY ENTERING IT FROM 1/THE SCREEN !/ FUNC VAL (REF NUMBER$) CLOSED PRINT CHR$ (147) //CLEAR SCREEN PRINT NUMBER$ PRINT CHR$ (19) //HOME CURSOR OPEN FILE 93, "", UNIT 3, READ 1/SCREEN INPUT FILE 93: NUMBER CLOSE FILE 93 RETURN NUMBER ENDFUNC VAL 11: L/USE THIS FUNCTION AS IN THIS //EXAMPLE: VALUE: =VAL (TEXT$) 11 1/STRING CONVERSION 1/BASED ON VAL FUNCTION FROM THE //COMAL NEWSLETTER //THE PENCOLOR SETTING SHOULD 1/MATCH THE BACKGROUND COLDR 1/AFTER CALLING THIS PROCEDURE, //THE PENCOLOR SHOULD BE RETURNED WTO ITS ORIGINAL COLOR PROC STRING (VALUE, REF TEXTS) CLOSED TEXT$:="" //CLEAR STRING
```

```
COLOR PRINT CHR$ (147) //CLEAR SCREEN PRINT VALUE PRINT CHR$(19) I/HOME CURSOR OPEN FILE 93, "", UNIT 3, READ //SCREEN INPUT FILE 93: TEXT$ CLOSE FILE 93 PRINT . CHR$ (147) //CLEAR SCREEN ENDPROC STRING WUSE THIS FUNCTION AS IN THIS //EXAMPLE: DIM TEXT$ OF 20 NUMBER: =5 STRING (NUMBER, TEXT$) //TEXTS WILL HOLD THE STRING "5"
```

**The RANDOM statement allows easy creation and manipulation of random (actually relative) files. However, the information sent to the disk must be string datal numeric data will not be recorded. Also, make sure that you WRITE to and READ from the file. Do not PRINT to or INPUT from a random

**If you have a COMAL system disk you already have a procedure library! If you run a program from the COMAL disk and nothing seems to happen, you have found a procedure file. List the program I There procedures and study it. These procedures can save you a lot

**Converting numbers to ASCII characters is still. performed by the CHR# command. But the conversion of a single character to its ABCII value 1s performed: by the : ORD command, e.g.

**When you wish to hold up a program while someone reads information from the screen use

```
PENCOLOR 11 //SET TO SCREEN file. of effort in writing programs. mutters to VALUE: =ORD (TEXT* (20)). either:
```

WHILE KEY$-CHR$(0) DO NULL TRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE WHILE KEY$C&gt;CHR$(32) DO NULL Y/PRESS SPACE TO CONTINUE

**If a program attempts to read more records from random: file than were recorded, a STACK

OVERFLOW error will result. 7

Hereafter, are requested to furnish PRE-FOLDED, PRE-ADDRESSED, and PRE-STAMPED nailer with their completed request blank disks. NEW MEMBERS will be given due consideration and assistance to get started.

WOTE: &amp; Use care in the initial folding of your nailer to guarantee function and prolong life.

&amp; Use a straight-edge along the pre-cut fold lines.

&amp; For 2 disks, fold each tab on the ist and 2nd pre-cut fron the •iddle.
