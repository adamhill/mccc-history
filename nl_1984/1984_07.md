## President's Column

I'm looking forward to the July Quarterly Meeting. We will again be having a series of workshops, with each chapter being responsible for one of the presentations. The planned topics are:

H.E.B. - Introduction to Machine Language

F.W. - Vic-20 and Ham Radio

G.P.: - Koala Pad

Arl. - Jim Butterfield's C'64 Training Tape

The training tape being used in the Arlington presentation was purchased by the MCCC to be used for educational purposes. It is designed to provide help for new C'64 owners. There will be sign-up sheets for those people interested in classes.

After the workshops, there will be a swap meet time. If you have anything you would like to swap or sell, it to the meeting. Everyone is invited to browse. There will not be individual chapter meetings at the quarterly meeting, but we will have the usual software swap time. I hope to see you all soon. #

Persons interested in learning. or sharing information in either:

1. Machine Language.
2. Comal

will have the opportunity to get together at our July Club meeting.

Our librarians want vou to know that the bulk of our public domain programs are on tape as well as disc. They invite members to bring their taping equipment to the July Club meeting in order to speed the process of making copies. This service will be available at all quarterly club meeting and you are encouraged to particitate.

I had been using EASY SCRIPT word processor for about two months when I bought my printer. I found the Smith-Corona TP-1 daisywheel on sale, I bought I bought cha When printer the Cardco CARD/? interface (version A) on the way home.

The frustration began when I printed out a few lines of single-spaced text and it came out double-spaced. First I rechecked. my word processor settings. Then I tried setting on the every switch printer. . Nothing helped. Finally, I decided it was a bad printer. Two hours later my second TP-1 had the same problem.

It was another hour before I found the real culprit. The CARD/? has several modes of operation.: The default mode (put simply) double-spaces on some printers. A secondary address must be used to instruct the interface to the additional linefeed. "There's the solution," I thought. "Set the secondary address eliminate in EASY SCRIPT!" Then I found EASY SCRIPT has no such setting.

Forcing myself to be calm, I read the Cardco when 1 made time heading date heat sure it would work.. I keyed in one line of commands in direct mode. It worked! Here are the commands:

interface mode

OPEN4, 4,28: CMD4:PRINT"LOCK": PRINT#4: CLOSE4 This is a permanent lock on. the (until power is removed).

Now my word processor works normally (what an improvement). Here is the process I discovered:

1. Turn on everything with the Cardco
2. power connector unplugged.
2. Load the Cardco set-up commands (now
4. stored on disk as a short program).
3. Plug the Cardco power board into the cassette port.

4. Run the set-up program.
5. Load in EASY SCRIPT.

This procedure was welcome after the alternative. After several months, though, thisroutine of set-up became tiresome; especially since Cardco released the new CARD/?+G. The new interface (plus graphics) needs only DIP switch settings to work properly with any printer. Excitedly, I wrote to cardco requesting information on possible upgrade of my interface. came shortly. No upgrade. The прота невола. a company would, however, exchange interfaces with me for $40 plus C.O. D. charges.

Since then I have decided my CARD/? isn't so bad after all. I just have to remember to set up the printer and interface before I · load the word processor.#

## Commodore Policy

D. Wilkins

(Excerpt from the CACTUS COMMUNICATOR, newsletter of the California Area Commodore Terminal Users' Society) The MCCC NEWS first published the Commodore exchange policy in the January Issue. Here are some further details for your information.

In the June issue of RUN there was a very good article about a person who was worried about getting service for his Commodore 64 after the 90-day warranty had expired. It was an interesting article because like alot of other people I had some of these same worries.

Computers, being what they are, I could see that trying to get one repaired could be very expensive. I first learned about Commodore's return policy about five months ago and have since learned about the same policy for other items besides the computer.

I admit that not being able to use your equipment for the 2-4 weeks it takes to get it back from Commodore is a long time, expecially to those of us who like to use our computers on a daily basis. But you are getting back a brand new piece of equipment, with all the new updates that might have taken place since you first bought the equipment, and that is a big plus!

In this column I would like to add a few items that were missing from the article in RUN magazine. A list of all the different items that Commodore will replace and their cost:

| VIC 20 Data Cassette               | $35   |
|------------------------------------|-------|
| Commodore 64 Computer              | $55   |
| 1540, 1541 Disk Drive              | $85   |
| SX-64 Computer                     |       |
| 1701, 1702 Monitors                | $95   |
| 1515, 1525, 1526, MPS 801 Printers | $75   |
| 1520, 1650 Modems                  | $35   |
| 1600 Modem                         | $30   |

As you can see, there are alot of different types of Commodore equipment that you can call about for replacement besides the computer. And in every case what you get back is not a repaired unit, but a brand new one. I'm not sure why Commodore hasn't made this information more available to the users of their equipment, but I am glad that they do provide the service.

Here is the address and phone number of the office in

Dallas:

Commodore Business Machines 4350 North Beltwood Parkway Dallas, Texas (214) 458-1000

and they may have to restock before filling your order. You may call between 9 and 11 AM or 1 and 4 PM. Be that you also wish to exchange. *

It is suggested that you call first as stock is limited certain to also include manuals and/or connection cables

This is the third of a four part series that was presented by Gary at the Quarterly Meeting in April.

## ABBREVIATIONS

The use of abbreviations can speed up and simplify the use of some commands in both the direct and program modes. A few are:

"7" for PRINT

"ST" for STATUS

"TI" for TIME

"TI#". for TIME$

"P shift I" for PRINT#

"R shift I" for RIGHT$

"I shift N" for INPUT#, etc.

## PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS

* Use multiple statements per line. These must be seperated by a ":".
* Use abbreviations for faster input. Be careful not to exceed line limit of 80 characters (expanded abbreviations can cause future listing and editing problems).
* Use REM (remark) statements to identify the program name, date and author. Avoid using special characters such as quotes, cursor, and other symbols in REM statements.
* Use LIST with a number range and use the CTRL key to slow a listing display.
* Use a structured type of program (with commands such as GOSUB &amp; ON-GOSUB) to make the program more readable and process more efficiently.

## EDITING A PROGRAM

* Entering a new or changed line always requires the touch of the RETURN key with the cursor still on the line.
* Repeating an existing line requires:
2. changing the line number and any other desired change on the line and
1. listing the line,
3. hitting the RETURN key.
* Deleting a line onlt requires entering the line number on a blank line and hitting the RETURN key.
* Changing a line requires editing it with the insert or delete keys or typing over the characters in the listed line.
* When listing a program (or directory) use the CTRL key to slow it down and the STOP key to stop the listing.
* Editing string values, entering a double quote, puts it into a special string-edit mode where special keys are represented by graphic symbols and give it the command in the program processing. For example, the reversed "S" is HOME; the reversed heart is CLEAR, etc. The INST/DEL key will still work properly and the second set of quotation marks will return you to the normal direct mode for editing.
* To enable a change in the repeating of keys, use the following pokes:

For normal repeating - POKE 650,0 (default) (both cursors, space and INST/DEL keys)

For no key repeats - POKE 650,127

For all keys repeat - POKE 650,128

## FUNCTION KEY USE

The function keys are accessible in two ways:

- 1) By their graphics symbol when used within sets of double quotation marks, and
- 2) By their character string (CHR$) value.

Use for Function / Value:

F1 / 133

F5 / 137

F2 / 134 F6 / 138

F3 / 135 F7 / 139

F4 / 136 F8 / 140

Insert a GET and IF statement like the following to process100 GET A$: IF A$="'"THEN 100

110 IF A#=CHR$ (133) THEN your option or. use

100 F1=CHR$ (133) : F3=CHR$ (135)

110 GET A$: IF A#='" THEN 100

120 IF A# = F1 THEN option #1

130 IF A$ = F3 THEN option #2

Question: How do you figure out the interest charge?

When the program runs, the last line of the chart shows the amount of the last payment: balance plus interest. (The initial balance was dropped one cent so that the printer would line up numbers.)

(Catalina Commodore Computer Club)

QUESTION, Is there a really good book from which I can learn machine language for the Comnodore 64? If not, how can I learn to program in machine language?

ANSWER: To answer your first question - NO. I wish there that I can reconmend with enthusiasn. There are about a dozen books on programming the 6502, some more machine specific than the Apple and Atari machines). When I was trying to learn machine language I worked through all of them, and discarded them in disgust. Even the much advertised Machine Language For Beginners (R. Mansfield, COMPUTE! Books - available for about $10) has missed the boat, in my opinion.

Trying to learn machine language from these books 1s like trying to learn BASIC from the Programmer's Reference Guide! What most of these authors fail to "recognize is that when first learning to drive a car you don't need a course on car maintainance. To start a book for beginners with two's complements arithmetic, or the *thoery behind converting hex to decimal to binary, or a functional block diagram of a 6502, just encourages the belief that machine language is incomprehensible to mere mortals. You don't need to know how a spark plug functions to drive a car!

My other major complaint with these "introductory" texts is that they alnost always try to cover all 151 instructions which the 6502 understands, instead of concentrating on the few that are used more often than the others, IIn the Commodore PET's own ROM, 41 of these 151 instructions are NEVER used - in fact, 80% of the ROM uses only 20% (30) of the instructions! For details, see "Analysis of the Use of the 6502's Opcodes" by H. W. Whitlock Jr., Dr. Dobb's Journal, March 1981, pages 11-13). When you learned to program in BASIC you didn't waste your time at the beginning learning to use WAIT, SYS, PEEK, POKE, etc.r you learned the most commonly used instructions first.

So how did I learn? Well, I started about a year ago, and being aware of both my modesty and brilliance, tried to go it alone. Big mistake (actually I never make BIG mistakes, merely minor errors in judgement!). Then, I found a small group of people who were in a similar position to myself and we met twice a week for hours per night trying to learn teach each other what we had learned. Of course, after a while the books became usefu, progress accelerated, and the group became smaller! However, our biggest problem was getting to the could understand "introductory" books. Once we were there it was like sitting on peak (peek?) of Mount Kilimanjaro, not the highest point in the world, but certainly the highest one on the continent!

The book we found most useful at this stage was: "6502 Assembly Language Programming" by Fernandez, Tabler and Ashley. Although it is not machine specific, it is much because unlike BASIC, we feel there is more that we don't know than we do.

better than most of its type. We still meet once a week,

So how can you learn? Well, you must first be an accomplished BASIC programmer, although a knowledge of string manipulation (MID$, LEFT$, RIGHT$, etc.) 15 not necessary. Second, you must have the desire to work at it - machine language is not a spectator. sport. With these provisions, there are now enough people in the club who have both a feeling for and a knowledge of machine language who could help (true of the MCCC, too. -Ed.). If you can con one of them into sitting down and teaching you for a few hours, it won't take long to get off the ground, lat least to the top of a mountain!), so that you will be in a position to teach yourself. It 1s well worth the trip - the view is marvellous!

## LETTER TO THE EDITOR

I have a problem with one of the programs I got at the Ilast club meeting and I hope you can help me.

some help in your next newsletter for me? There must be tips on its use.

Has your printer started leaving blobs of ink on the paper? Can you see a faint line the paper wherever the print head has traveled? If s0, you need to clean your print head! Of course, if you are like me, you will wait until you absolutely have to put &amp; high-quality printout in the mail and then stay up until 1AM trying to figure out how to clean the printer. In the hope that I can save you some of that trouble, here's how I cleaned my Genini 10X.

With a good deal of fear, I unscrewed the two screws holding down the print head. So far so good. I had the instruction manual to follow. Once I could see the front of the head, I could see all the gunk that had accumulated. I tried to clean it with a @-Tip and alcohol but there was too much. In desperation I tried prying the dirt out with a toothpick. That worked pretty well but also pried out a small plastic doo-dad. Oh well, too late to worry now, right? I continued cleaning with the toothpick then went back the O-tip and alcohol (unflavored and denatured). I noticed the to be plank and not black after all. Phat" was clean (except the Q-tips, tissues, toothpicks and my hands). I was able to put the plastic piece back in place and wriggle it gently until the print wires were aligned though the holes. Then I repositioned the print head and put the two screws back in place.

PAINTBRUSH is an inexpensive ($15-20) cartridge for the Commodore 64 that allows you to draw pictures on your color monitor using your joystick. So much for the good news.

It comes complete with a whole 1 page instruction sheet (small size paper) printed front and back. It also has a demo tape with pictures of a car, city, boat, storm and "hesware",

The cartridge offers 9 paintbrush widths, the ability to save or load pictures using either tape or disk. You can draw and erade lines (often when you don't want ta), protect or unprotect the color, clear the screen or fill an area with color.

There are no predefined shapes, no commands to move a shape, replicate, rotate, or otherwise process pieces of your picture, nor is there any magnify function to facilitate detailed work.

My experience trying to use PAINTBRUSH was frustrating without either leaving a line I didn't want or erasing something I did want. When I tried to draw a tree and fill the leaves with green against a blue sky the whole system froze and I had to power off.

Conclusions? Another fine HES product. If anyone out there is feeling masochistic, I will gladly sell my cartridge to you for $7.50. Good Luck. #

For all you frustrated Jumpman addicts who haven't been able to make it through all 30 levels, here's a great way to do it. It's cheating, but at least you get to see (and play) all the levels.

* First: Load Jumpman like normal. When the beginning display starts hit RUN-STOP/RESTORE for your reset switch).
- Type these commands in:

POKE 24015.173 POKE 54296,15 OPEN 1,8.0

SYS 9*4096

The first POKE command fixes it so you'll never lose any men, the second POKE restarts the sound, the. command opens up the disk drive, and the SYS starts the program again.

This comes out of Torpet magazine, but I've never been able to get the RUN-STOP/RESTORE way to work, so I just hit the reset on our five slot expander...works like a champ! This is the only way I've been able to get through the top levels of Jumpman, and I love it! Have fun! *

When writting a basic program you may find it desirable to orint a blank line number. or indent your statement after the line number. Try this: To print a blank line number, enter line number, enter any shifted letter, press space bar, enter any shifted letter, press return. to indent a statement. enter: line number, enter any shifted letter, press space bar the number of indentations desired, enter statement, press return. *

The July Board of Directors meeting was called to order by Club President Diane Dews approximately 10AM, July 7, at the Hurst at Recreation Center.

Chapter presentations for the July Club meeting were discussed. Each chapter will limit their programs to 30 minutes each and give three times so that members can attend at least three of the four. An additional room will be set aside for the librarians for the purpose of providing members with on the spot copies.

Bruce Nelson the Club has approximately $4500 in assets of which $3400 is in the Club's account, $400 is in cash, and $1000 is in for sale items (mostly disks).

A motion was passed to reimburse Bruce $42 for the purchase of "DI-SECTOR", a program which is being provided to the chapter librarians for their use in copying public domain programs.

## Arlington News

The June meeting of the Arlington chapter of the Mid Cities Commodore Club was called to Francine Wharton. The first order of business was the question of liability insurance. It explained that the expenditure of approximately $300 would provide $500,000 of liability insurance for the club. The expenditure was approved by the membership.

The second order of business involved the question of MSD Disk Drives for the chapters. The membership approved the expenditure by the club of 50% of the cost of the drive for any which was able to raise the other 50%. The question of whether the Arlington would take advantage of the opportunity was tabled.

The program for the month was an explanation and demonstration of spreadsheet programs.

Following thie normal question and answer session. the meeting was adjourned to software exchange. #

## HEB News

At the May HEB meeting a motion was passed to publish a list of members including addresses and phone numbers. Please call Roy Baker if you do not want your address or phone number included in the list. The schedule for the directory will be determined later. There was an excellent demonstration by Desiree Livingston on how to choose a word processor and why she chose the Mirage Word Processor. The June HEB chapter meeting included passing a motion to procure liability insurance of one-half million at a cost of $300 a year for the entire club. The question was raised as to whether or not we should allow the club to pay half the cost of a MSD Dual Drive and whether or not the chapter was interested in getting one. We will vote next month at the Quarterly Meeting on this issue. A demonstration was then given by BYTEWORKS, and a "question and answer" session followed.

The next officers' meeting will be August 2 at 7:30 PM at Roy Baker's home, and the next chapter meeting will be August 18 at the Hurst Recreation Center. *

FOR SAVING AND RE-SAVING AND RESAVING by Dr. Norman H. Sanders:

On programs I write, line 2 always takes the form:

2 PRINT "BO: PROGRAM NAME", B

This way, when I make a change in a program, and want to re-save it. I do not wonder how it is listed in the directory.

I list line 2... cursor up to it...change the 2 PRINT to SAVE...press RETURN...and automatically save to the same file name each time.

(Reprinted from THE USERS PORT, newsletter of the San Fernando Valley Commodore Users Group) COMPUTERS ARE FOR THE BIRDS?

Some early computers were made of relays and some of vacuum tubes. During World War II, psychologist B. F. Skinner designed a computer made of pigeons! Skinner's computer was designed to guide bombs to their destination. A screen displayed an image of the target. The birds were trained to peck at that image. Sensors detected the birds' pecking and automatically adjusted the bomb's trajectory to keep the image centered. Bird lovers can rejoice - the bomb was never used.7

## THE FIRST COMPUTER BUG

I'm sure we have all had bugs in our programs but do you know what the first computer bug was? In 1945 the MARK I computer at Harvard University stopped working unexpectedly. The programming team (which included Grace Hopper) investigated and found a moth into a relay where it had been beaten to death, samned taped the poor thing into the log book and thereafter whenever an official asked them about progress they explained they were "debugging the computer". The moth is now on display in the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.7
