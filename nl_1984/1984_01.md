## DISK DIRECTORY PRINT

For those of vou with a need to be neat organized, here is the proceedure for printing the directory for each of your disks. You then use the printout as a label or simply store it with the disks. It will give your library that "well-groomed 1ook" and make it much find any program.

This proceedure will work on the Gemini Gemini 10X, Commodore 1525. We suspect that it will probably work on other printers (suitably interfaced) as well.

1. Insert disk for desired directory.

3. Type - OPEN 4,4,2 (RETURN)

2. Type - LOAD "*",8 (RETURN)

4. Type - CMD 4 (RETURN)

6. Type - PRINT # 4. CLOSE 4 (RETURN)

5. Type - LIST (RETURN)

This çan be very frustrating for the novice who is just beginning to understand the language. Here are some useful shortcuts from Danny Oxford.

1. For repeat keying (pressing a key to repeat character without lifting) use POKE 650,128.
2. To disable the Run/Stop key use POKE788, 53.
3. To re-enable the Run/Stop key USE POKE788, 49.
4. To move the cursor to line "x" use POKe 214,X. ‹ "X" may be any number.)
