## President's Column

The quarterly meeting is coming up Saturday, April 21. It's been three months since we met under one roof and I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again.

We've planned a special meeting for you. Ken Widner. activities chairman, and others have been busy getting together a series of Mini-Workshops with informative and intertaining presentations. The presentations will be repeated to allow attendance of three of the workshops. Topics will include:

Shortcuts and Hints for C'64 - Garry Wordelman •Spreadsheets Display - Cory Scott Serial and Parallel buss - Al Frigola Epyx Software Demo - Jim Mertz Drawing Packages - Brian Foley

- Dan Branam

There's sure to be something of interest for everyone.

The librarians will be located in a central area at the meeting for copying the library. They have also come up with a plan to facilitate disk orders. Be sure to read the Revised Library Rules at the end of this newsletter. It includes order forms and instructions. If you have any questions, contact your librarian before the meeting Saturday, I am happy to report that we have some additions coming to the library; Al Todd of Arlington has donated 21 disks, Francine Wharton arranged for an exchange with the Austin Users Group, and John Hand has made arrangements for an exhange with SCOPE of Dallas. I know everyone appreciates their efforts for the club.

The MCCC was invited to participate in the KMEZ Computer Fair in Dallas, Mar 30 - Apr 1. I want to thank those members who helped man the booth (and those who helped woman the booth, too).

See you all Saturday.

## A CHECKLIST OF ESSENTIAL &amp; DESIRABLE FEATURES

## WORD PROCESSING

## Essential Features:

* Mail/merge interface with a quality database
- program.
* Support underlining and boldface capabilities.

## Desirable Features:

* Eighty column screen-
* Utilization of special function keys
* Similarity between the material on the screen and in printed form. The user should be able to view the text on the screen without seeing printer control characters. Underlines and boldface should be seen directly on the screen. or at least highlighted with their special characteristic indicated on the status line.
- to reduce the overall number of required. keystrokes
* Column formatting to help prepare financial
* Fancy printing capabilities proportional spacing and right justification. as
- statements.

## DATABASE PROGRAMS

## Essential Features:

* Mail/merge with a word processor.
* Multiple field sort and select criteria.
* Ability to handle at least 30 fields.
* Form and report generation capabilities.
* File reorganization capability. This enables users to add another needed field (which was not included when the file was originally established) to the file without losing any of the existing data.
* Math functions with calculated fields.

## Desirable Features:

* Note fields. These allow data to be entered into the records in the form of a series of notes in the same way you write comments оп a regular file folder.
* Menu or graphic icon prompts.
* Non-unique key fields.

## TV OR MONITOR?

television sets is that they are not designed to and eyestrain. Monitors have better resolution and This consideration is an important one especially for the user who plans to operate the computer for long periods of time.

A TV set doesn't have the high quality i Solution that a of be viewed at close range are.) Extensive result in fatigue provide sharper letters and graphics.

## Monitors are available as shownt

* Monochrome: Lowest cost and available in
* Color: Better for graphics use than text.
- one phosphor color either white, amber or green.
* Red-Green-Blue- Both excellent resolution and color graphics, but more expensive.
* Combination: A relatively new addition, it provides a high quality TV picture and color component monitor.

## CONNECTOR DATA

If you want to make some of your own cables, following is the data on the types of connectors needed to interface to the C-64.

* 5 Pin DIN used for Audio/Video * 6 Pin DIN for Disk/Printer/Power Switchcraft #12BL6M * 7 Pin DIN for Disk/Printer/Power Switchcraft #15GM7M *

## Editorial

From a membershio of over 400 and families. only one entry was recieved for the Master Programmer's Contest... It has become more and more difficult to get people to volunteer to help with any the meetings including clean-up... The newsletter editors rarely get more than two articles submitted for the monthly issue...

We intended to write an editorial in this "Apathy in the Club" but frankly, we just didn't care.

## Printing Columns by H. Wilson

Given are a couple of lines of code that will allow you to always print a given field. That is, if you are working with columns of numbers that you always want to stack in a line as:

```
    10.37
  102.15
        etc
```

This code will do it.

There are two decisions the programmer must make. First - how many places to the right of the decimal, and second - how many places in the field.

Lets say we want numbers in fields of 12, 2 decimal places, and the number is A.

```basic
10 B$="(12 blanks) "           Field Length
20 L =INT(A)                   Truncates Decimals
30 L$=STR$ (L)                 Converts to String
40 R =INT (A*10**2)            Moves Decimal 2 Places
                                         And Truncates
50 R$=STR$ (R)                 Converts to String
60 D$=RIGHT$ (R$,2)            Sets Decimals By Picking two
                                         Digits From Right
70 N$=B$+L$+"."+D$             Puts String Together
80 A$=RIGHT$ (N$, 12)          Sets A$ Into A Field of 12
                                         Right Hand Justified
```

This can be accomplished on a few lines by combining statements.

```basic
30 L$=" (12 blanks) "+STR$ (INT (A))+"."
40 D$=RIGHT$ (STR$ (INT (A*10**2)),2)
50 A$=RIGHT$(L$+D$, 12)
```

Putting it into more general terms we can make it subroutine. If we let:

- x = the number
- ND= the number of decimals
- NF= the field length

```basic
1000 REM - THIS ROUTINE RETURNS XXX.XX
1010 L$=""
1020 FOR I0=1 TO NF
1030 L$=L$+" "
1040 NEXT I0
1050 L$=L$+STR$ (X)+"."
1060 D$=RIGHT$ (STR$ (X*10**ND) .ND)
1070 X$=RIGHT$ (L$+D$,NF)
1080 RETURN
```

This can now be executed from any section of the program as:

```basic
110 X=P : ND=2 : NF=12
120 GOSUB 1000
130 P$=X$
```

the

```basic
190 X=I : ND=0 : NF=4
200 GOSUB 1000
210 I$=X$
```

```basic
250 PRINT I$: P$
```

Given is an example program that demonstrates this technique.

```basic
5 OPEN 4.4,2
10 REM THIS PROGRAM IS AN EXAMPLE OF PRINTING
15 REM COLUMNS OF NUMBERS.
20 REM IT WILL CALCULATE AND PRINT THE INTEREST
25 REM AND AMOUNT OF INVESTING $1000 AT 12.5%
30 REM INTEREST OVER TEN YEARS.
40 REM I IS THE YEAR
50 REM IN IS THE INTEREST
60 REM P IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT
100 P=1000
105 PRINT#4, "YEAR INTEREST   AMOUNT
110 FOR I = 1 TO 10
120 IN=P*.125
130 P=P+IN
140 X=I: ND=0:NF=4
150 GOSUB 1000
160 I$=X$
170 X=IN: ND=2: NF=10
180 GOSUB 1000
190 IN$=X$
200 X=P: ND=2: NF=12
210 GOSUB 1000
220 P$=X$
230 PRINT#4, I$: IN$: P$
240 NEXT I
244 PRINT #4," "
245 CLOSE 4
250 END
1000 REM THIS ROUTINE RETURNS XXX.XX
1010 L$=""
1020 FOR IO = 1 TO NF
1030 L$=L$+" "
1040 NEXT IO
1050 L$=L$+STR$ (INT (X)) + "."
1060 D$=RIGHT$ (STR$ (INT (X*10^ND)) , ND)
1070 X$=RIGHT$ (L$+D$, NF)
1080 RETURN
```

## Ipading ML Programs

Frequently you will see instructions on disk ОГ cassette programs of the C-64 or VIC to append the load command with ""1". This secondary command turns off the auto relocator and loads the file where it was saved from previously.

With machine code files it would be disasterous to allow relocation to occur because BASIC thinks that the program is a BASIC program and walks through changing what it thinks are the line pointer/links. This is certain death unless a special BASIC front end program is in place; then BASIC will walk through the short program to its end and not get into the machine code following.

If a BASIC program had been previously been saved by the same machine (and memory configuration in the VIC) then the program can be loaded with or without the ""1" command since the line links are correct to start with.

## NE Wing Disks by Tom LOch

Formatting (NEWing) disks is the process whereby the tract and sector road map magnetically marked on the disk. This process takes about one minute and makes no use of index holes (you can in fact use hard sectored disks in a CBM drive).

The difficulty exists in the semantics of 1541 disk drive manual. The problem is that the the manual suggests that the user could issue the following command to New the disk:

## PRINT#15,8, 15, "NO: disk name, XX"

Since the "OPEN15,8,15" command had not been issued the computer will report a "FILE NOT OPEN ERROR". The solution is to issue the OPEN command then the NEW command. You can shorten the syntax tot

OPEN15, 8, 15. "NO: disk name, XX"

Once the OPEN command is issued the channel will stay open until program loaded or the computer is reset at which time all channels are closed.

Another hint for the brave: You can turn off on the disk drive or reset the computer with and disk in the resetting river ret only problem will be the disk when it is active (reading or writing). The disk may write over wrong tracts if disk drive tor you do this.*

## New Mail List

The MCCC has recently switched to a new mail list and sorting program. There are bound to be some unavoidable errors when anyone enters over 400 names and addresses. Please be patient with us and report any problems or errors in your mailing address. Thank you.

COMMON MATURES - With the wealth of special features it seems hardly worth mentioning, but yes, you can set screen colors, baud rates, stop bits, duplex and even whether x-on/x-off protocol is in effect. Formatting end-of-line is also available.

DISK FEATURES - You can get a disk directory or delete disk files without leaving Vidtex. One very nice feature - once Vidtex is loaded, you don't need the Vidtex disk in the drive and so you don't find yourself repeatedly swapping diskettes.

SPECIAL FEATURES - Some truly special features make Vidter the only way to fly when using Compuserv. With Vidtex, Compusery knows all the commands to clear your screen, control colors. format your screen, tec. This results in much more readable displays. Some Compuserv functions even store screens in your computer's memory so that the constant data doesn't have to be sent each time. This means faster operation and lower Compuserv bills. Because of the special protocol, files from Compuserv can be downloaded with no errors! I recently downloaded "Star Trek" which fills about 67 blocks. It ran the first time with no tribbles at all.

That's not all but it is enough! You are probably expecting a $99 price tag but I have good news there too. It sells for only $39.95. If you are a Compuserv user it is well worth the price. If you only use the local BBS'5, it is still a fine terminal is better than the others I've seen (with the possible exception of the $149. Super Term.) 9f

TPUG OFFER

Are you interested in joining the Toronto Pet Users Group(TPUG)? The MCCC will receive one tree disk for the club library for every 20 persons who join and you will receive a $5.00 discount on the seabership fee. Contact one of the club officers if you are interested.

Many people have asked me about a good terminal program that included upload and download capability. I have finally found it! The Vidtex program sold by Compuserv contains all of the commonly desired features and many uncommon ones. Here's a summary of the features.

AUTODIAL - when used with the 1650 Automodem the program can dial the phone for you, When used with the

Vicmodem (or Hesmodem) this feature cannot be used.

AUTOLOG - you can create any number of disk files which will dial a host computer and perform necessary log-on proveedures automatically. This can be used with either 1650 or 1600 type modems although, of course, the 1600 cannot dial the phone.

UPLOAD - disk files may be loaded into a text buffer which can be from 23-32K. From there it can be sent to the host computer either as a continuous chunk or , as prompted, one line at a time. In addition, Compuserv B protocol is available to load disk files directly to Compuserv.

be captured in the text buffer. You can toggle this buffer open and closed as desired. You can also erase, print, or save the contents of the text buffer to disk as desired. You can review the contents of the buffer on the screen before deciding on your action. Compuserv B protocol is provided for free downloading of files from Compuserv directly to disk.

PRINTING - In addition to printing the text buffer, you can print the contents of the display screen at any time.

FUNCTION KEYS - You can define the function keys to perform almost any desired function. In addition, you the definitions to disk, or reload such a disk file.

Since the first of January I have been programming almost exclusively in COMAL. Although Version 0.14 its limitations, I now find reluctant to program in BASIC. I have several reasons for this, the strongest is my appreciation of COMAL'5 powerful structures, e.g., CASE OF and REPEAT UNTIL. These allow me to use structured flowcharting when planning a program unlike technique. a structured flowchart "becomes" program. It can be typed into the program and backed the proceedures that perform the basic function of each block. The old type of flowchart is usually quite difficult for impossible) to debug or to code into an actual program. Lines and arrows can make the flowchart work but they increase the difficulty of coding especially in BASIC 2.0. Structured flowcharts, on the other hand, must form a contiguous block when completed just as the program a contiguous set of instructions. By the way, I'm not pushing detailed flowcharting as a requirement for good As you will see, programming. my flowcharts do not give full detail to the program. Ido however. find it beneficial to organize my ideas so that I don't get lost in mid-program.

## THE BUILDING BLOCKS

The basic unit of a structured flowchart is the block. The block depicts a function to be performed:

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000004_9a3bb56728ed1162740597a08bb9c479de4be046e8ded12c5ae4634c8f9f51ef.png)

A program is made up of blocks stacked one upon the other:

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000005_7661d3a065d7eef1bf5dc6796a143d82a5707538e59e0da3620289fc500b330a.png)

As structures are added the chart grows more complex. but a properly designed program can still together to form one contiguous block.

## ADVANCED STRUCTURES

In a flowchart the structures of COMAL represented as: are

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000006_57d1cd032e7bd285048adb45426829bc0bc400cfa23e34df9790cd69336fbb9f.png)

The only structures I haven't listed are PROCEEDURE and FUNCTION. These are actually subprograms, so they look just like programs. For example, our program:

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000007_e1cb9c50ef6a44aa545a035a7e85f9c0a28824f66a8d256295490fdd92ad9385.png)

is actually made up of two proceedures and one function. The proceedure GET DATA would look like this:

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000008_5aea48bad92af7ec5c66802a2ef063cb78779b856cf01ff0ce3ec376a68a1be1.png)

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000009_ad8c0131651191f0963f0a09ff21d28083fd73d4cd9d0c5b938e7e259db4a645.png)

Since CALCULATE RESULT operates on numeric data, can be written as a function. CALCULATE RESULT would be:

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000010_0c9c13369316942d0d02baaa89b7fe23d50012b5f1f52504fd9453ef4dc15aef.png)

Finally, PRINT' RESULT is a little more complex:

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000011_165dc9962accdaa4dee7e860712fcb36c002cd2f42ae0d4f05b6b22ffde4677e.png)

The complete program based on the flowchart would be:

//NUMBER AVERAGING PROGRAM

//THIS PROGRAM WILL AVERAGE

//A PAIR OF NUMBERS

## GET' DATA (VALUE A, VALUE B)

PRINT RESULT (AVERAGE)

AVERAGE: =CALCULATE RESULT (VALUE A‹VALUE: B)

PROC GET' DATA(REF FIRST' VALUE, REF SECOND' VALUE) CLOSED

[INPUT "ENTER 2 NUMBERS": FIRST' VALUE, SECOND VALUE END PROC GET DATA 11

FUNG CALCULATE' RESULT (ALPHA, BETA) CLOSED

SUM: =ALPHA+BETA

AVERAGE: =SUM/2

END FUNC CALCULATE RESULT

RETURN AVERAGE

![Image](1984_04_artifacts/image_000012_bc344ec0a699969e50120c51bcf993ab3ffe1338ad0405f3d4f8c5cccfcee2d3.png)

I sketched in the lines to show the structures. This illustrates why detailed flowcharts are not required. Listing the program should show everything needed to understand the program. *

## Pure Fun by Colin Thompson

Colin Thompson is one of the editors of Commander Magazine. We reprinted his articles courtesy of "THE USERS PORT", newsletter of the San Fernando Valley Connodore Users Group.

How many joystick doodle programs do you have? I have six. How many will dump your pretty hi-res pix to the printer? I now have one and I really have a good time with it. The program came on a disk full of computer fun from Cardco - The Printer Utility Program. If you have a dot matrix printer, the PUP is sure to liven up those · long winter evenings. Each of the various programs the disk is written for the VIC and also for the C-64. The program - Saleen. Dump- is a "hide-away" utility. You load it computer and then store it in some out of the way place so program will not different locations in RAM. After the M/L code is safely tucked away, you may print a screen to the program or by pressing one of the function keys. The program will faithfully print on your printer exactly what is on the screen, be it text or hires graphics.

Three! her programs are also included. One is a banner maker. similar to. other commercial programs, but this one has three heights and two different fonts: Computer and er Cosputer character Gothic. The joystick dosale program works with the Screen Dump. The last program is a series of nine hires pictures which you may view on the screen or dump to the printer.

## The Transactor by C. Thompson

The Transactor. one of premiere Commodore-specific magazines. has been quietly publishing some of the best technically oriented articles for a long time. Since the Transactor is a Canadian operation, not many Americans have found this gem. It is subscription-only in the United States, but if you like to bathe yourself in Butterfield and the like, then this bi-monthly shower of high tech information will be quite refreshing. It's a slick magazine in more than ways one. The current issue is a complete compendium of memory maps, graphics, charts and other inside information on the Big Three: VIC, C-64 and Pet. I predict this will be the most often Xeroxed magazine issue in history. Editor Karl Hildon does a fine job of assembling brightest Commodore writing putting their fresh ideas out in a readable format. Beginning this spring, the editorial content will begin a shift towards the less experienced Commodore owner. I only have one problem with the Transactor; it's the most borrowed magazine in my librarv. However when the copies are finally returned, the subscrintion cards are always missing.

## Board Report

The April Board of Directors meeting was held April 7 at the Hurst Recreation Center. President Diane Dews called the meeting to order. Eighteen officers and members were present.

The first topic concerned a new set of proceedures for requesting program copies. (Look for this at the end of this newsletter and at the general meeting April 21.1 Concern was expressed that the Arlington chapter news was not included in the last newsletter. Gary Wordel man made a motion which was approved to set aside one page for each chapter in the newsletter. David Glazener, Grand Prairie Chapter President, requested a budget of $20-$25 for advertising and postage to send materials to prospective members. Bruce Nelson, Club Treasurer, said this would be done for the next three months and board approval was necessary.

The Grand Prairie Chapter met on March 10 and March 20 to organize and initiate the activities of their chapter. Officers were elected (see Officer Directory) and policies were set as to the meeting times, programs, etc. The following is a summary of their decisions.

1. MEETING PLACE AND TIME. Until our chapter outgrows the available space, we will continue to meet Grand Prairie Memorial Library, We will monthly, the second Saturday from 1:30 to 5:00 at the meet twice PM and the fourth Tuesday from 6:00 to 9:00 PM.
2. CHAPTER TRAINING. Russell Rahn will charge $25. per person for conducting a class in COMPUTER LITERACY. $5 of the tuition fee will be given to the chapter treasury. The first class was held March 24 from 9:00-11:00 AM. The classes will be held for 8 consecutive Saturdays, excluding April 14. (Space is not available.)

3. LIBRARY. Members are encouraged to donate programs to the library, especially those programs written members of the club. It is hoped that authors of such software will give their permission to share their work with the entire club.

Grand Prairie members please note that the next chapter meeting April 14 will begin at 3:30 PM instead of the usual time.

## Board Report cont'd

LeRoy Baker, HEB Chapter President, asked if membership directories could be published and made available to club members. Bruce Nelson said he would have the membership list complete and up-to-date within a week at which time a membership directory could be published. Diane Dews announced our thanks to Dana Taylor for accepting the position of Club Secretary. A motion was passed to provide Club T-shirts (cost $63) to each of the Club Officers to help identify them at the meetings. A motion was passed to purchase SUPEREOPY" at a cost of *43d The disk will be used by the Arlington Chapter but may be requested by the other chapters whenever needed. Diane Dews stated that incorporation proceedures should 18 be completed by April 21. The meeting was adjourned.

We now have "Super Copy" which enables us to copy a whole disk in less than 10 ainutes, as opposed to 30 or 45 minutes. Everyone is encouraged to bring their computers to each aeeting and copy some of the disks you desire for your library. This in addition to the four request copied fron the library, I think you will find it worth the little extra effort as new disks are arriving all the time.

May 5th aeeting will be at 1:30 at the Arlington Community Center. The program will be Rev. Patrick McCoy who will discuss data base| and interaction with word processor.
