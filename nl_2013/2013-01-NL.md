## The Tricorder Is Real!

Holy Spock! The Star Trek Medical Tricorder Is Real, And It's Only $150

The device you're looking at is called the Scanadu SCOUT and, basically, it's a medical tricorder that will give you precise vital information about any human being within seconds, just on contact.

It's very real and it works now. I tried it myself, and knew I was looking at the beginning of a personal health revolution.  Star  Trek-level  stuff. Except it's coming at the end of 2013.

And  it's  not  only  SCOUT-the company  has  two  other  devicesScanaFlo and ScanaFlu-which are like having your own medical labs to go. Best of all, those two are so cheap that they are disposable.

SCOUT  will  not  be  disposable, though. The unit is a tiny hardware device that reads your vital health information on contact. You simply place it on the left temple and, in less than ten seconds, it will read your pulse transit time, heart rate, electrical heart activity, temperature, heart rate variability and blood oxygenation. Then it sends this information to an app  on  your  iPhone  or  Android phone, which displays it for you. You can even store your vitals for tracking, which could prove fundamental to many health situations at home.

Watching  SCOUT  at  work  was something almost magical, like having one of those giant health monitoring units reduced to a slice of plastic that fits on the palm of your hand. Which, actually, is exactly how it became to be.

## How SCOUT was invented

I talked with Walter de Brouwer, the Belgian genius who founded Scanadu after working at MIT and on several high profile tech projects, including One Laptop Per Child. A few years ago, Walter's own kid ended up in the intensive  care  unit  of  a  hospital. Frustrated  with  the  complicated devices that monitored his child's health, he started to think about how could  all  of  this  information  be turned into something that normal people could understand. He tinkered around at the ICU and became so knowledgeable that he eventually was assisting some of the nurses there, who  often  would  get  confused themselves.

Walter thought that there was a need for something that would be able to monitor anyone's health, anywhere, with ease and at low cost. He thought about instantaneous vital readings, molecular diagnostics, visualization, and storage of personal health data all wrapped in an easy-to-use device that would connect to your smartphone or  tablet  to  show  you  all  the information  you  could  need  in  a simple way. Not only for yourself, but for remote assistance too.

Most probably, Walter had watched too much Star Trek in his college years. He wanted to make a tricorder. So he did.

## How does it work

At first, he thought it was possible. In fact, there are other teams who are working in similar projects to win Qualcomm's  Tricorder  X-Prize Competition, or the Nokia Sensing Challenge. So what if all had failed so far?

So Walter started to work on what would become SCOUT, ScanaFlo and ScanaFlu. He assembled four teams of specialists at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field,  California.  Each  teamengineers,  chemists,  doctors, mathematicians  and  software engineers-worked  together  to come up with new, smart ways not only to monitor vitals, but to detect actual  infections  within  seconds. According to Walter, they use all the tricks  in  the  book:  imaging  and sound analysis, molecular diagnostics and data analytics, all combed by 'a suite of algorithms to create devices that offer a comprehensive, real-time picture of your health data.'

SCOUT is their first product. This personal health tricorder is so simple that it will cost around $150 when it appears at the end of 2013, after it gets US government approval. It may very well become as ubiquitous as home thermometers, which were introduced in the 19th century. In fact, says Walter, that's the whole point :

Consumers don't have the tools they  need  to  monitor  their health  and  make  informed decisions  about  when  they're actually sick and need to see a doctor.  We  want  to  empower consumers to take control of their health and give them direct access to their personal healthfeed.

Judging from what I saw, SCOUT may be exactly that.

## Detecting infections

Along with SCOUT, I saw two other products  that  were  even  more impressive: ScanaFlu and ScanaFlo. I couldn't get photos of these-they are still in a rough prototype stage-but they are easy enough to visualize.

For ScanaFlo, imagine a disposable blue plastic rectangle with a QR code and  a  window  that  reveals  paper swatches and a color calibration target. To get a reading, you need to pee on the  rectangle  as  one  would  on  a pregnancy test. Depending on the content of your urine, the swatches will change color.

But what do these color mean? You don't  have  to  guess  or  remember. Point your smartphone at the QR target and it will take a photo, telling you if it detects anything out of the ordinary  based  on  the  hue  of  the paper swatches, which react differently depending  on  your  health  status. According its creators, ScanaFlo tests for  'pregnancy  complications, preeclampsia,  gestational  diabetes, kidney  failure  and  urinary  tract infections.'

ScanaFlu  works  in  a  similar  way. Instead of a rectangle, it's a square with a small protuberance on which you have to spit. Your saliva will be distributed to different test units using tiny nano-vessels. Incredibly enough, this 'disposable cartridge will provide early detection for Strep A, Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus and RSV.' Like  ScanaFlo,  you  will  use  your phone's camera to have a result sent to your app.

These disposable systems will be sold in packs, also at the end of 2013.

## Why this is the future, and why it is so important

I'm not a hypochondriac, but it's not hard to see the importance of these devices. While being able to monitor your  own  health  would  never eliminate  the  need  for  doctors,  it could do wonders for everyone's wellbeing. These cheap devices will keep track of your own health but, as I discussed  with  Scanadu's  founder, they can also be easily used to detect infection outbreaks at a national or planetary  level,  with  people anonymously  uploading  data  to  a cloud. The Center for Disease Control or the World Health Organization can literally keep their fingers on the pulse of the entire planet. The possibilities are truly endless. No wonder Stephen Wolfram is one of their advisors. If they are successful, I can't wait to see what  people  can  do  with  all  this anonymous data.

If these gadgets can really provide you  with  instantaneous  feedback about your health status for such a low price, this will be the beginning of  something  much  bigger.  The monetary  savings  in  prevention alone-and  not  depending  on expensive  laboratories  for  many tests-makes it all worthy.

But  even  more  exciting  is  the potential  increasing  accuracy  of diagnostics, based on the tracking of data over time. As Dr. Alan Greene, Chief Medical Officer at Scanadu, says:

When it comes to health, averages don't  cut  it.  Vitals  change throughout  the  day  and  vary from  person  to  person,  so  it makes no sense to assume we are all  the  same.  Health  decision shouldn't be based on averages, they should be based on a real, accurate  and  personalized healthfeed of data, which we now have the power to give to the consumer in the palm of their hand.

Indeed. The future looks good. I'm ready for this, Dr. Bones.
