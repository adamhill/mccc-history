8- powerful  next-generation computer custom designed to run the latest version of the AmigaOS. Building on the success of the Nemo  design,  A-EON Technology commissioned Ultra Varisys to create a new generation motherboard, codenamed Cyrus Plus, built around Freescale's P3 and P5 QorIQ series of PowerPC processors.  The  QorIQ  series (pronounced Core IQ) includes several variations of 32-bit and 64-bit  single  and  multi-core PowerPC processors. As with Nemo,  the  Cyrus  Plus motherboard has been custom designed to run the latest version of  AmigaOS 4 and will support multiple  PowerPC  Linus distributions. The board is pin compatible with several 563-bit Freescale QorIQ CPUs including the P3 P3041, an e500mc quadcore CPU running up to 1.5 Ghz

Varisys Ltd, who were recently acquired by Ultra Electronics, is already the proven developer  and manufacturer of the groundbreaking Nemo motherboard which is at the heart of  A-EON Technology's AmigaONE X1000 system. Powered by the unique PA Semi PA6T-1682M 64-bit dualcore  1.8Ghz PowerPC processor, the  AmigaONE X1000 is the most and the P5 series P5020, an e5500 dual-core running up to 2.0 Ghz. The P5040 quad-core CPU which operates up to 2.4 Ghz should also be compatible.

Cyrus Plus Motherboard

In its prime, the sound quality delivered by the Amiga's on-board Paula chip was pretty special. Its 4 channel stereo 8-bit audio output with frequencies up to 28 kHz when using 15 kHz screen modes, or up  to  56  kHz  with higher  horizontal frequency  screen modes was so far in advance of the IBM PC's monotone beep, which  was  virtually  mute  by comparison. The Amiga's audio was further augmented by a whole host of digital sound cards and samplers supplied by numerous hardware  manufacturers.  Sadly those days are long gone. However, that is all about to change. A-EON Technology is proud to announce Prisma Megamix, a modern nextgeneration sound card for Classic Amiga  computers.  The  Prisma Megamix is a dual-use card which can be connected to either the Zorro  II  or  a  Clockport  and incorporates a VS1063 DSP chip which can play and encode MP2, MP3, WMA, OGG, LC-AAC, HEAAC, FLAC, IMA, WAV PCM and many other sound formats making it ideal for hi-fi audio playback and streaming applications. It achieves this with very little CPU overhead enabling  full  200  Kbps  stereo playback on a standard 68K Zorro II Amiga while still allowing good multitasking.

With Prisma Megamix, an Amiga 2000, 3000, 4000 or A1200 can mix MP3 streams and encode/decode them  in  real  time  without burdening  the  CPU.  The  MP3 sound processor is fully handled by CPLD and is transparent to the software. Audio data transfers are streamed at 16-bit (Zorro II) or 8-bit (Clockport), and bit banging is not required for SPI accesses to the MP3 sound processor. Mixing inputs for Paula, genuine sound and line in are provided, as well as earphone outputs and line outs. In Zorro II equipped Amigas, the Prisma's Clockport can be used for add-ons and multiple cards can also be installed allowing audio enthusiasts to mix their tracks at full  quality.  Special  drivers  are being written for AmigaOS 3.x and 4.x systems and a Xorro PCI-E version is also planned for A-EON Technology's  Next-Generation AmigaONE systems.

Up  to  a maximum of 50 Beta Test places are  being  made  available  and preference  will  be  given  to developers,  existing  active AmigaONE X1000 and AmigaOS4 Beta testers along with AmigaONE X1000 'First Contact' customers.

If  you  wish  to  register  your interest in joining the Cyrus Plus beta test team please send an email to  contact@a-eon.com  with 'Cyrus Plus Beta Test Programme' in the subject line. The Cyrus Plus board is built around a Freescale QorIQ (pronounced Core IQ) P5 64-bit e5500 dual-core PowerPC processor running at 2.0 GHz. The CPU, which is used in the defence and aerospace industry and is part of Freescale's Product Longevity  Program  which provides for a 10+ year lifetime availability  for  the  CPU.  The Cyrus Plus board will support up to  15GB or DDR3 RAM and include  boot  firmware  on  a MicroSD card. The other major on-board components include: SATA 2.0 (2); PCI-e X16, X4, C1 (2), X1/Xorro; PCI (2); USB 2.0 external (x6, internal headers (x2); Ethernet;  ;  Serial  1/f;  Xena chip/Xorro  combination (enhanced;  etc.  All  successful applicants will be required to place a deposit on joining the beta test team. Detail will be provided in the beta test information pack. Cyrus Plus boards are due to start shipping towards the end of this year. Join the Cyrus Plus beta test team and help create AmigaONE Next-Generation history.
