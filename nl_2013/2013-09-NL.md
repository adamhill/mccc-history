## Interview with Trevor Dickinson

Trevor  Dickinson  funded  a company in mid 2009, called AEON Technology,  with  the purpose  of  developing  new hardware for AmigaOS 4 and beyond. Since this time, Trevor became a key player in the Amiga scene. It's now time to see his next projects.

A-EON Technology CVBA was a Belgian  company  originally formed  in  2009  to  develop modern  hardware  for  the AmigaOS. Initially I had several business partners but eventually I ended up managing the company and  funding  most  of  the development and manufacturing costs. With the AmigaOne X1000 project successfully completed there was no need for a company based in Belgium.

Having successfully completed the AmigaOne X1000 development, I decided I would like to continue funding  new  hardware  and software for the benefit of the whole Amiga community. As a result,  I  backed  a  new  UK

company, A-EON Technology Ltd, in partnership with Matthew Leaman, who is also the M.D. (managing director) of AmigaKit, a successful international Amiga retailer servicing both the Classic and next generation community. With Matthew's assistance, we hope that all the new hardware and  software  projects  will  be undertaken on a sustainable and commercially viable basis. As a result,  we  have  pre-funded  a number  of  software  projects which should benefit AmigaOS 4.1  users.  These  included RadeonHD drivers, the Warp3D drivers for Radeon HD graphics cards, Catweasel MK2 drivers for the AmigaOne X1000 and other AmigaOne computers and the Libre Office suite. We are also pre-funding a number of hardware and software developments for Classic  Amiga  and  Next Generation Amiga users. Watch this space.

Interesting question. We are not planning to expand the A-EON management at this time, although we  are  looking  to  forge  close working relationships with other companies and individuals.

Success can be measured in many ways. When I started the project I set myself a number of goals with the ultimate objective of creating the most powerful custom built 'Next  Generation'  AmigaOS computer released to date and from a technical viewpoint the AmigaOne X1000 project has been very successful.

However,  the  biggest  cost  in small volume manufacturing is the 'Non-recurring Engineering' development charge (NRE). This is the labour and material costs associated with developing the product and manufacturing the first prototypes. Inevitably you will also need to make several revision designs along with new prototypes. If you are building hundreds  of  thousands  or millions of units the NRE cost is 'almost' negligible when spread over the large number of units sold. It is a very different matter with small volume manufacturing for any market.

We took a phased approach to developing  the  Nemo motherboard for the A1-X1000. The first  step  was  a  proof-ofconcept and we pre-funded US $115K for initial development and prototyping. Five prototypes were  manufactured  for  stress testing and porting AmigaOS 4. After review we took the decision to make a number of minor design improvements and create a revision 2  motherboard.  Revisions  cost more time and money and delay. Prototypes are also very expensive because they are made in very small volumes and can cost up to US $5000 per board.

Another five Revision 2 prototype motherboards were produced for testing and driver work. Why so few boards you might ask? Because you want to make sure there are no major hardware surprises before moving  to  production manufacturing. As it was, we ended up creating a revision 2.1 board with the associated additional cost. Also, due to supply issues, we a pre-funded a batch of P.A. Semi CPUs (PA6T-1682M) for the beta test program and first batch of 'First Contact' AmigaOne X1000 systems.  That  was  before  we started taking deposits for the beta test programme.

All-in-all the NRE costs to produce the original prototypes, revision 2 modifications and new prototypes for hardware testing burnt almost $200K in pre-funding. That is the reality of the situation. If we could sell 200,000 units that would only add one dollar to the sales price. However, if we only sold 200 that that would add US $1000 to the sales price. Also it did not help that Apple purchased P.A. Semi and closed down production and the prices of the CPU almost doubled. The initial costings were based on a CPU price of $500 each. Since Apple ceased production the CPU prices have varied between ~$600 and $1000 per unit. However, we have absorbed these price increases and have not passed them on to the customer. So was the project a commercial success? No, I will not recover my original investment. Do I consider it a technical success? Most definitely yes.

Having said all of that, the Nemo development  also  helped established  the  foundation  for future projects and the experience has shown me that there is still a strong  demand  among  Amiga enthusiasts  for  a  custom  built 'Next Generation' machine. As long as that demand remains I will continue  to  help  fund  new hardware  and  software developments.

More that 200 and less that 2,000.

No, for all the reasons given in my answer to third question above.

We were not worried. When the news broke Varisys contacted us to reassure us that they valued our unique and unusual business. They are  building  more  Nemo motherboards,  the  Cyrus  Plus project is ongoing and we are in the process of contracting them for another development.

The Cyrus development is the future replacement for the Nemo motherboard when the supply of P.A. Semi CPUs finally dries up or the price becomes commercially unviable. The Cyrus board was the original Revision 1.0 prototype and was completed towards the end of last year. Cyrus Plus is the Revision 2.0 board which includes additional PCIe and PCI slots. The Cyrus  design  is  based  on  the Freescale P5020 CPU which is a dual-core 64-bit PowerPC SoC. It also supports DDR3 RAM and includes an improved Xena/Xorro combination.

Note: The name for systems based on the Cyrus Plus board/CPU combinations has not yet been finalized. For simplicity, internally we  are  referring  to  the  P5020 model as the AmigaOne-X2000 and  the  P5040  model  as  the AmigaOne-X4000. However, this may  change  by  the  time  the commercial models are available for sale, which won't be for quite some time.

There are several projects in the works or being planned to rectify this  issue.  There  are  people actually working on Xorro and

Xena applications, but to answer your question, again it all comes down to volume. We had hoped that some hardware developers might  design  special  Xorro applications for the AmigaOne X1000 and we are still hopeful that this will happen. In the meantime, AmigaOne X1000 beta testers can and  have  purchased  Xorro development boards to create their own projects and it is our intention to commercialize one or two of these projects in the future. In addition,  we  are  including Xena/Xorro  capability  on  the future Cyrus hardware.

At this moment in time we are concentrating on our own 'Next Generation Amiga' hardware, but we will revisit this question once we finish the current projects.

Recommendations from Varisys coupled  with  the  price, performance and Freescale's stated commitment to a long term (10 years) production cycle. Also the pin compatibility with the quadcore P5040 makes a 2.4GHz model an attractive proposition for the ultimate 'Next Generation Amiga.'

Cyrus is the codename for the new motherboard  and  as  with  the Nemo  board  is  based  on  a character from Jules Verne's novel, 'The Mysterious Island.' Captain Nemo and Cyrus Smith are just two of the characters and there are plenty of others in the book!

In  keeping  with  the  long  held Commodore tradition we added a B52 song title to the motherboard. On the Nemo motherboard it was 'Keep this party going' and on the Cyrus  boards  it  is  'Breezin'.' Again, there are a lot of B52 song titles left!

It's really too early to provide firm information at this stage. Varisys are now putting the Cyrus Plus board through the same rigorous testing programme that the Nemo board  underwent.  Once  this  is completed we will build a small batch  of  boards  (~10/12)  for developers  to  iron  out  any hardware bugs. After that, the next phase will be to produce a limited run of ~50 boards for a reduced beta test programme. All being well the  beta  test  boards  will  be available by the end of the year. Commercial boards will follow some time after that. As for pricing. we are hoping that the new Cyrus Plus board with the P5020 will be slightly  less  expensive  than  the Nemo board, but no promises at this stage. Pricing for the P5040 version will depend on the cost and availability of the Freescale CPU.

Yes, it proved very successful with the AmigaOne X1000. However, the  number  will  be  limited  to around  50  beta  testers  as  I mentioned above.

As with Nemo, the Cyrus Plus board has been developed to run the  AmigaOS  but  I  would personally  like  to  see  the  new boards  support  all  the  Next Generation Operating Systems including  PowerPC  Linux distributions.  The  more  the merrier.

We will continue to manufacture AmigaOne X1000 as long as the demand continues and we can source  P.A.  Semi  CPUs  at  a 'reasonable'  price.  Incidentally, another  batch  of  Nemo motherboards are being processed by Varisys at this very moment.

No, I was not the original initiator of the AmigaOS 4 netbook project. When I realized that, due to a number of issues, it looked like the development effort had stalled I contacted  the  Chinese manufacturer to try and kickstart the project. Timothy De Groote of  Hyperion  Entertainment provided a prototype LimeBook for us to test and following some prolonged email negotiations with the manufacturer we managed to get a reasonable price and volume commitment.

The LimeBook itself is not a bad little  machine,  even  if  it  is somewhat underpowered and the keyboard  is  a  little  flimsy.

However, after performing detailed cost analysis which included NRE set-up  costs,  OS  porting  costs, driver  development,  branding, import  costs  and  AmigaOS  4 licenses we could not get the end user price much under £500 (VAT inclusive), and that is with based on ordering and pre-paying for batches of 1000 units at a time with a very minimal sales margin added. We think that is far too expensive for such an underpowered machine. As far as we are aware the project has not been officially canceled. However, we are now leaning in another direction altogether.

Yes, we are increasing our support for  software  projects  and  new Classic Amiga hardware projects. Expect to see news of these in the near future. Warp3D has proven more difficult and taken longer than expected. I had hoped to have a demo available for the recent Silicon Dreams show. However, the  Warp3D  work  has  helped accelerate  the  Gallium  3D development.

I  try  to  boot  all  my  machines regularly, as time allows.

Yes, why do I do it, am I crazy! No, I  am  an  Amigaholic! Seriously though, knowing what is coming through  or  planned  on  the hardware front the emphasis now needs to shift focus to software and content.

Thank you for the opportunity of sharing  my  Amiga  passion (obsession) with your readers.

I'm still looking for a Commodore 4000T model and would really like to get my hands on an Amiga 3200. I'm also very interested in some of the unreleased post Commodore 'Powered by Amiga' clones like the BoXeR and Power 5000. Matthew Leaman has promised to supply me with an Index Access Cube, but I'm still waiting!

Libre Office was always slated as a long term project. The developer continues to make good progress and  we  will  make  an announcement as soon as the work is done.

I actually counted them recently for  another  interview  and  the grand total is now 180. My latest acquisitions include an A3000 and CD32 which I was given for free. However, I've just purchased a DraCo  Cube  which  should  be winding its way to New Zealand as we speak!
