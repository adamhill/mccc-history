## Cinemaware for Blackberry

Special BlackBerry Z10 launch price break  from  $  2.99  to  $.99  for  a limited time

Cinemaware®  and  Amiga  are bringing  their  famous  titles  to BlackBerry

MIAMI,  Florida/SEATTLE, Washington, USA. - March 14, 2013 Amiga, Inc. and Cinemaware (the company which originally introduced cinematic storytelling into games) are working together to bring the entire Cinemaware catalog of Amiga games to the latest BlackBerry® devices.

- 'In partnership with Amiga, we are excited to announce the availability of our titles for BlackBerry devices and to be part of the launch of the new BlackBerry 10 platform,' said Oberst Leermeister,  a  corporate spokesperson  for  Cinemaware.
- 'These fun and very addictive games can  now  be  played  anywhere,  by anyone with a new BlackBerry 10 smartphone.'

Amiga  is  proud  to  announce  the immediate availability of Wings . More than just a simulator, Wings features genuine  arcade  action  and  an emotion  packed  role  playing experience. This will be followed by many more classic Cinemaware titles including Defender  of  the  Crown ®, Rocket Ranger ™, Lords of the Rising Sun ™ and It Came from the Desert ™. The first Amiga computer shipped in 1985 and was an immediate hit with game  developers  and  publishers. Many of today's best known game publishers  got  their  start  on  the Amiga. The high-quality production of games from the likes of Team 17, Ocean, EA, Factor 5, Lucas Arts, Bitmap Brothers and Cinemaware, to name just a few, coupled with the state-of-the-art hardware made an unbeatable  combination.  Today Amiga, Inc. is working with these publishers to make many of these amazing games available to play once again.

Calling  all  classic  Amiga  game developers and publishers… If you hold  the  publishing  rights  to  a commercial  Amiga  game  or application, or know somebody that does, then we are seeking to get in touch with you. Amiga are bringing classic games written for the original Amiga hardware to life on Blackberry devices  using  our  new  Amiga Anywhere platform. Please contact us at developer@amiga.com
