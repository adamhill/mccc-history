## New Tech

There actually have been a few bits of news in the Amiga-sphere over the past month-plus. For Amiga OS4, the new Storm C editor version 5 for programmers is available, along with Assist, a 'knowledge base' utility intended to aid OS4 users in getting the  most  out  of  their  systems. MorphOS has seen many an update, such as version 1.20 of the Odyssey web  browser,  2.4  of  the  vector graphic program Steam Draw, and 1.3 of the file recovery app IceDoctor. A  new  word  processor  called Cinnamon  Writer  is  now  out, intended to be light, capable, and support open document formats. A new emulator for the classic (and obscure) Vectrex game console is out, and works. In my testing I felt it needed some polish, running mainly from a shell and requiring SDL and GL support to run at all. A basic GUI  and  better  full-screen  and controller support will help a lot in a future update.

On the emulation front, a good deal has been happening. A new Ami Kit, the software and skin package for an ultimate Amiga experience (capable of working on real Amiga hardware, but  often  better-suited  to  an emulated environment) is available for  your  download-and-update pleasure.  Amiga  emulation  kings Cloanto have been busy as well, with a new 2013 edition of Amiga Forever for PCs, as well as Amiga Forever Essentials,  providing  legal  Amiga Klckstart ROMs for Android device Amiga  emulators  for  the  bargainbasement  price  of  99  cents.  I'm hoping  to  have  some  sort  of demonstration of Amiga emulation on an Android tablet at this month's meeting. Hope to see you there!

I've  written  at  length  previously about my Samsung tablet (which I've had for just under six months as of this writing). I've been enjoying it and trying to use it in a more creative outlet than many might use a similar device. I have really put it to the test this  last  couple  weeks  however, giving  it  the  temp  job  being  my primary Internet portal. A while back the wireless networking on my Linux laptop  decided  to  conk  out.  It's always been a little temperamental from time to time, but this was fullon holding one's breath until passing out.  Considering  I've  used  and abused the laptop over the last six years  or  so,  it's  not  surprising something should go. Still, it left me in an awkward position. For now it's sitting in the living room with the desktop Amigas, Pegasos, and Macs, using wires for Internet like an animal. The  television  and  other entertainment sits in the other room, however, making it difficult to watch TV and surf the net in the fashion that degrades western society and I've become  accustomed  to.  I've considered the purchase of an extralong Ethernet cable to drag the 'net back to the main living space, but until I do, the laptop shall either be trapped with the desktops or remain net-less.

Taking up the slack in these difficult times,  my  Android  tablet  has attempted to fill the void. In some ways  it  is  superior  to  the  laptop, being  smaller,  lighter,  and  more portable all-around, meaning I can sit and surf wherever I please. The tablet definitely gets a workout under these circumstances, with me using up a full charge worth of time at least once per day. The downside is, while the  tablet  with  its  touch  screen interface is great for casual and onthe-go browsing, I wouldn't want to deal with it as a permanent solution. The mouse-based control paradigm and  desktop  interface  has  the advantage in allowing more than one method for doing things, such as if you wanted to move from the top to the  bottom  of  a  long  web  page normally, fast, or extra-fast, where most of the time 'fast mode' on a tablet means 'do the same thing you do normally, but faster.' Unless a site is geared toward mobile use in the first place, you're likely to find links too small to hit with confidence using your fat fingertip, forcing you to either zoom in or hope for the best. Typing using the on-screen keyboard is its  own  special  kind frustration (though I imagine better on a tablet  than  a  smart  phone), which makes me evaluate whether I want to bother with anything which might require me to type more than a sentence or two of text. All I can say  is  whoever  decided  the apostrophe should be on a separate page from the main keyboard should be hit with a dart every time I need to write a frikkin' contraction. Don't get me started on the gymnastics involved in trying to copy and paste a snip of text from some page, either. Still, I'm glad for the opportunity to try this out, as I get a chance to see the future as others assume it will eventually be. Perhaps some new utilities or a different browser might smooth things over, but it's apparent the paradigm will need to shift a bit before  the  tablets  and  phones become the predicted everything for everyone all  the  time.  If  we  can figure out how to write the word

'I'm' with less than five keystrokes, we'll be halfway there.

## Is Google Glass a World Class Hoax?

An extremely elaborate prank. That is what I've determined Google Glass is as the company begins to ship these loony glasses.

I've come to this conclusion based on a number of factors. The first clue is today's all-over-the-place coverage about how Eric Schmidt, who cannot maintain the joke, is cracking under the strain. Unable to keep a straight face, he said during a speech yesterday that Google Glass is 'the weirdest thing.' He also said that people will have to develop new norms, noting certain inappropriate uses. You know, like in the bathroom. Then there was some discussion about having to bob your head around like an idiot to get the glasses to do certain things.

That's when I finally confirmed that this is an elaborate ruse designed to humiliate the public while Sergey Brin, in what must be an attempt to top the most elaborate hoax in the history of mankind-Piltdown Man, laughs at us all.

Imagine a roomful of people with these glasses on, some reading Yelp reviews to themselves, some making movies  of  themselves,  and  some making movies of the people making movies themselves. Others are taking pictures while still others are trying to navigate the menu by jerking their heads around, winking, blinking, and rolling their eyes in various patterns. Does anyone but me see this as overt insanity? It's like a scene that should have been in Woody Allen's Sleeper .

This  begins  to  take  on  epic  gag proportions-something Brin's life has been leading to. And he is the obvious perpetrator of this, let there be no doubt.

While Brin is not the only prankster in this crowd, he's their leader. I recall, some years back, Eric Schmidt giving a speech to some college kids. It was shown  on  C-Span  or  one  of  the university  networks.  As  Schmidt plowed through the PowerPoints, he complained that he had to be careful because the practical jokers in the company executive suite were always getting a hold of his presentations and jiggering them up with embarrassing slides to humiliate him.

Then  there  was  a  picture  floating around the Internet of Brin in a dress pulling some gag. I'm sure there was a big laugh at someone's expense. These glasses are the topper. Everyone who thinks this tech geegaw is great gets to humiliate himself by wearing these glasses and looking like an escapee

MCCC      4418 Sharpsburg Drive      Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org from a Borg 'sig' at the last Star Trek convention.

I first became suspicious about the whole ploy after two ludicrous chance encounters with Brin. The first was last year when Scoble caught Brin with the glasses on. Scoble made a huge public fuss about it. His reward was an early device and an apparent wink. The second was the outrageous meeting on a New York subway with Noah Zerkin, who happens to be a big proponent of wearable computing devices. Coincidence? I think not!

Exactly why Brin, who has two 767s in the Google hangers and is worth billions  of  dollars,  is  riding  the subway was never questioned. The media just gushed over this supposed happenstance as if it is an everyday thing.  It  was  such  an  obvious publicity stunt.

Brin is clearly bored and this is his idea of an elaborate joke. I think Eric Schmidt sees that it's completely out of control and he wants no part of it, hence why he is slowly backing away from the whole thing.

At some point there will be a big reveal, though it may be a while away if Brin has his way. The Piltdown Man hoax ran for 40 years. Let's hope this  Google  Glass  insanity  ends sooner than that.

Happy head-bobbing, suckers!
