## Technology

I was involved with the Amiga since I was a teenager. Before that I used a Commodore 64, among other computers, and Atari game machines before that. Today I'm in my forties, and looking back I realize my own life has followed the history of home  computers,  from  nonnetworked game devices to the Internet-dependent  portable wireless  devices  of  today.  I shudder to think how I might have fared if I had to grow up in today's world where any careless release  of  information  might open  you  up  to  spammers, identity thieves, cyber-bullies, or the nation of China. I certainly made enough mistakes in days when the stakes weren't quite as high.  Who  knows  what's  to come in the future, when the old-folks homes are full of the Internet generations.

One of the interesting things about technology is, given the right  mix  of  popularity, usefulness,  availability,  and affordability,  it  becomes something 'everyone has.' Of course, obviously not everyone on  Earth  has  it,  but  it's ubiquitous enough that most people you know probably do, and it suddenly becomes strange to  deal  with  someone  who doesn't. Possibly inconvenient too,  such  as  when  the assumption is 'everyone' can get a message on their voicemail or answering machine or mobile or e-mail,  and  you  find  the exception. Myself, I don't always fit  the  profile  of    'everyone,' and often fall behind the pack sometimes, or ahead at others. In earlier  times,  things  such  as telephones and radios moved from status symbols to standard equipment in most homes. Later it was television. At one time, it wasn't considered unusual not to own a television at all, while now many  have  several,  and  if someone says they have none at all, they are assumed to be either impoverished or some kind of elitist  snob.  In  the  eighties, having a computer in the house slowly gained more and more acceptance as a regular thing, and in the following decade having at least one of those computers connected  to  the  Internet followed. In the early nineties, being  'on  the  net'  was considered largely the exclusive domain of the nerds and geeks by the general populace, where less than a decade later it became to  domain  of  pretty  much anyone and everyone (possibly to the chagrin of those nerds and geeks who knew how to conduct themselves). The new 'everyone' is  rapidly  adopting  Internetconnected  smartphones  and similar  devices,  to  the  point where they could even supplant

those  other  things  everyone once had, like land-line phones, digital cameras, and maybe even home televisions and computers.

As I mentioned previously. I don't always fit the 'everyone' mold, and my preferences and priorities aren't always the norm. My life  as  an  Amiga  user  is probably testament to that. I've also grabbed onto a piece of tech here or there that didn't catch on with the general public, though I used it and liked it myself. I've worked with the earlier  generations  of  digital cameras  by  Sony  that  used floppy discs and CDs. I've never owned an iPod or any other personal digital music player, at least not any where that was its sole function. My mobile MP3 players always had at least one other function - a PDA, a computer,  an  automobile. Speaking of PDAs, I've had two by  Palm,  neither  of  which functioned as a phone (even though Palm kinda pioneered the concept). It took a very long time  before  I  finally  got  a mobile phone, well beyond that point  where  the  proverbial everyone already had them. I didn't go for the smartphone, instead choosing the minimum for cost and worry. When your phone costs fifteen dollars, you don't feel all that bad if it gets a little dinged up, unlike a five hundred-plus dollar iPhone with an equally pricey data plan. It also helps that I didn't really expect to be repeatedly consulting some net-connected app while buying groceries  or  driving  or  taking pictures of my dinner. To take up that slack, I have the new tablet I've mentioned over the last few months of articles. I'm probably using it wrong though, as unlike many  I'm  not  using  it  as  a window to Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or FlibbleFlorts or Skibbles  or  Monkeyfist  or whatever else, though I do play Angry Birds. I've been trying to use it for art and graphics (why I got the Galaxy Note with the pen), even though it may not be as suited to the task as a desktop or laptop computer. It's enjoyable, gives me room to grow and learn, which reminds me of the fond feelings I had in my early days when I was coming to grips with the Amiga. The real point is it's useful and fun at the same time, which is sort of the point of a tech  toy,  no  matter  if  it's  a console radio or a mobile media device, no matter if 'everyone else' has one or not.

## Seagate Ships 4TB HDD Using 1TB Platters

Seagate has brought out what they claim to be the industry's first 4TB hard drive utilizing four 1TB platters; and according to a representative of Seagate 'the four-platter design is a winning one that allows for the highest performance  possible  while doubling capacity and reducing costs, ultimately giving consumers the best of all worlds.'

Seagate told MaximumPC its 4TB drive  is  nearly  800,000  times larger than the first desktop drive it introduced way back in 1979. There's enough storage space to store 800,000 photos, 450 hours of HD video, or over 1 million songs, 'all at the lowest cost per gigabyte in the industry,' Seagate says.

At 146 MB/s the drive also boasts the highest average data transfer rate  of  any  desktop  HDD currently on the market. It's not power hungry either, it consumes 35 percent less power than the competition, Seagate claims.
