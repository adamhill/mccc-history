## Amiga-By-The-Loop

## A new/old chapter meeting place

Beginning  this  month,  the  Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter  will  resume  meetings  in  one  of  our  previous meeting  spots  -  the  North  Richland  Hills  Community Center.  The  reason  for  the  move  is  simple…  Bell Helicopter  is  converting  the  classroom  space  we  were using into offices. The bad news is that meeting space is no longer free - the good news is that we again have a reason for our name… we'll meet 'by the loop.'

The  North  Richland  Hills  Community  Center,  in case you've never been there, is on the southeast corner of  the  Loop  820/Rufe  Snow  intersection.  The  meeting rooms  are  on  the  second  floor  of  the  east  end  of  the building. Check out the AGM website for a map.

Also of note is that this month we will be meeting of the month. As of this writing, no firm day has been arranged for the remainder of the Tuesday.

on the second Monday year,  but  we're  hoping  for  our  standard  2 nd Watch for news here and on the web.

## &lt;HTML&gt; Open Letter

## The latest from Jim Collas

June 8, 1999 Dear Amigans,

Ted  Waitt  was  recently  interviewed  by  Guardian Online about Gateway's plans in general. There was also a question specifically about Gateway's plans for Amiga that  Ted  answered  as  follows:  'we've  had  a  group  of people working on leveraging the Amiga assets into an appliance  strategy  for  us.  How  well  that  works  out,  I don't know: it will be interesting to see. There are some great assets there. It's definitely not a computer business.' This  comment  has  obviously  spurred  many  responses from the Amiga community. I want to assure people that this doesn't reflect a shift in our Amiga plans. We have not changed our plans to release a next generation Amiga multimedia  computer.  I  have  described  the  new  multimedia  computer  and  how  it  integrates  into  a  full  'in-

Dallas formation appliance' environment in my May letter to the community posted on our web site. Please read the May letter,  as  it  will  help  you  understand  Amiga's  product strategy.

Ted's comments refer to Gateway's product plans for using the Amiga technology. Gateway's main interest in the next generation Amiga technology is for the emerging information  appliance  market.  Gateway's  focus  on Internet  connected  information  appliances  is  justifiable given the extremely high potential of this market and its threat  to  the  PC  industry.  Prominent  Industry  analysts have  called  information  appliances  'the  next  Internet wave' and 'one of the most exciting opportunities of the new millennium.' By the year 2002, it is forecasted that information  appliance  shipments  will  surpass  PC  shipments  and  there  will  be  more  information  appliances connected  to  the  Internet  than  PCs.  If  I  were  CEO  of Gateway, this would also be one of my primary areas of focus. But I am not CEO of Gateway. I am CEO of Amiga and  I  don't  want  to  confuse  Gateway's  plans  with Amiga's. There is a significant overlap in our plans but there is a difference in focus. I have been empowered by Ted to drive Amiga as an independent company with its own  strategy  and  plans.  This  will  eliminate  a  major challenge that has held Amiga back for many years. The challenge of getting the proper attention and priority from large corporate parent companies which are focusing on their core business.

Regarding Amiga's strategy, I have mentioned many times that Amiga will use the immense emerging information appliance market to build momentum for our next generation  architecture.  This  is  why  we  have  come  up with an architecture that integrates the power of multimedia computing into a full home computing environment  that  includes  information  appliances.  This  is  a revolutionary  architecture  and  computing  environment for the future that combines power and simplicity. It is a powerful plan that gives Amiga a great chance of rising again as a significant force in the industry. On my trip to Germany and the U.K. last month, I presented details of the architecture and plans to a small group of prominent people in the Amiga community. I did this confidentially to get some feedback and validation on our plans. Once people  understood  exactly  what  we  were  doing,  the feedback was very positive and people were excited à

about the revolutionary new architecture. Personally, I am extremely excited about sharing details of the new Amiga architecture with the community as a whole but we are still in a very sensitive stage relative to competition and technology  partners.  I  know  this  is  frustrating  to  the community  since  you  have  waited  so  long  for  a  next generation product. We will continue to share as much information as possible when it is appropriate.

I  hope  this  letter  clarifies  Ted's  statements  on Gateway's  use  of  Amiga  technology.  I  will  continue communicating as much as possible. You can expect to see my June letter to the community in a few weeks. I promise  you  that  1999  is  going  to  be  a  great  year  for Amiga and the Amiga community. Keep the momentum going as we come back for the future.

Sincerely, Jim Collas President and CEO, Amiga
