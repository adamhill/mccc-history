## Editor's Comments

## How about that 3.5…

You'd think there'd be a lot of news this month wouldn't you? Amiga OS 3.5 is out. Someone ought to be reviewing it. At least that's what I thought. What I've got instead is an empty newsletter. It seems that with all the bad news last month, no-one has anything to say this month.

Well, since there's no 3.5 review, I should probably give

- you my comments. · It  installs  easily  and  without messing up your current settings  too  badly.  Your  user-startup  and  startupsequence  scripts  are  not  overwritten.  But…  your custom datatypes are disabled (they seem to all work fine when you re-enable them). · The installation does not replace FastIPrefs. This gave me my only problem. If I had read the documentation, this  wouldn't  have  been  a  problem  at  all.  (Thanks, Johnny and Mark.) Just replace FastIPrefs with the new IPrefs program and everything works much better. · The Preferences programs are much improved. They are more modern in design and there are new options that didn't exist before. Other programs have been updated as well… the new IconEdit program is outstanding. · It's still necessary to run MCP in order to patch things that still need patching. Obviously there's more work to be done. And when is the window design going to be modified so that it looks correct and proportional when running on a 1 to 1 ratio screen?
- The new Glow Icons are beautiful - at least on a highcolor  screen.  I'm  not  sure  how  this  all  works  on  a standard Amiga screen - I haven't tried it - but it sure looks  good  on  my  computer.  Of  course,  updating  a system like mine to an all new icon set is close to a lifetime endeavor - at least it seems that way. And we don't  have  a  workbench  based  tool  yet  to  make  the process easier like we did with the previous icon file formats.

Is  there room for improvement? You bet! Is it worth the upgrade price? You bet! After all these years, it's nice to have a update.

## Railroads…

## and space Shuttles…

The  US  standard  railroad  gauge  (distance  between  the rails)  is  4  feet  8.5  inches.  That's  a  pretty  odd  number. Why was that gauge used?

Because that's the way they built them in England, and English expatriates built the US railroads.

Why did the English build them like that?

Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used.

Why did 'they' use that gauge then?

Because  the  people  who  built  the  tramways  used  the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.

Okay!  Why  did  the  wagons  have  that  particular  odd wheel spacing?

Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.

So who built those old rutted roads?

The  first  long  distance  roads  in  Europe  (and  England) were built by Imperial Rome for their legions. The roads have  been  used  ever  since.  And  the  ruts?  Roman  war chariots first  made the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels and  wagons.  Since  the  chariots  were  made  for,  or  by Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.

Thus, we have the answer to the original question. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches of a Horse's rear.

derives  from  the  original  specification  for  an  Imperial Roman war chariot.

Specifications and bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder which horse's rear came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two warhorses.

And now, the twist to the story…

There's  an  interesting  extension  to  the  story  about railroad  gauges  and  horses  'behinds.'  When  we  see  a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster  rockets  attached  to  the  sides  of  the  main  fuel tank.  These  are  solid  rocket  boosters,  or  SRBs.  Thiokol makes the SRBs at their factory in Utah. The engineers who designed  the  SRBs  might  have  preferred  to  make

The railroad line from the factory had to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The  SRBs  had  to  fit  through  that  tunnel.  The  tunnel  is slightly  wider  than  the  railroad  track,  and  the  railroad track  is  about  as  wide  as  two  horses  behinds.  So,  the major design feature of what is arguably the world's most advanced transportation system was determined by the width of a Horse's rear.
