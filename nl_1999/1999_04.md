## UGN Meets Amiga from Wayne Hunt, UGN Director

17 March, 1999 To elaborate, or at least help Steven with the points he had, I  was  asked  at  the  last  minute  to  assemble  no more than 12 people to meet face-to-face with Jim Collas 'sometime  Saturday  afternoon'  to  represent  the  User Groups (and users) out there. This occurred at roughly 10:00pm Friday night. 8:00 Saturday morning, we had the UGN representative breakfast which lasted until about 9:30 or so, then found out from our liason, Darreck Lisle, that it was to happen at 11am that morning. I made the invitation to the attendees there, then literally RAN around the hall and show  floor  searching  out  each  and  every  user  group president and UGN representative I could find to attend the meeting. If anyone wasn't included, it was not for lack of trying, it's simply the fact that I didn't run across you before I had found 12 other people. As for the rest, here's what happened. After hauling our own chairs from the King James conference room, we all squeezed into Mr. Collas' suite to  be  greeted  by  Mr.  Collas  with  'do  you  have  any questions for us?' Oh boy was that ever an understatement! What followed was almost one and a half hours (overlapping the UGN luncheon) of feedback and discussion on several relevant subjects to include:

The Community The Amiga staff  there  pointed  out  to  us  that  they really  would  like  to  involve  themselves  fully  in  the existing community and in fact, become a part of it rather than simply 'the company.' JimC (who did most of the talking) pointed out to us that he's aware that Gateway has been 'screwing up' and underestimating the Amiga community and they want to make amends by becoming not  only  the  company,  but  'part  of  the  community  as well.' It  was  pointed out to the Amiga management that the public needs more news of every kind to come from the  company.  Not  just  'these  are  the  specs  and  dates' type news, but all of it. It was suggested that:

1. they look into the production of a biweekly or monthly mailing to all of the User Groups which would contain giveaway trinkets and news updates. (similar to Gateway's 'Prairie News' newsletter)
2. if they really want to start participating in the community, they might consider actively participating (when possible) in things like the UGN Mailing list.
3. let us know the personality details of the crew to make them a part of the community. Let us know who's hired and their background, etc.
4. include as news when AI goes out and talks to major third party  companies
5. It was suggested by several representatives (not me) that Amiga needs to really get on the ball as far as website updates and that they:
- make the .com a suitable, professional site · use the .net site for network services such as free web services to  UG's and free e-mail to all (ala gateway.net)
- use the UGN's .org site for all outgoing news to users and groups  which didn't fit on the .com site.
6. Mr. Collas stressed that they (Gateway) had underestimated the need to support the current machines and market and he firmly pledged that 'the classic machines aren't going away for at least another two or three years.' Now, he didn't offer specifics other than the fact that they would continue (or in the minds of some attendees, start) supporting and developing for the 'Classic Amiga line' even after the new machines were introduced.
7. We (the UGN) need to get our contact information verified and updated in the database so that each User Group could be contacted directly from Amiga with pertinent mailings, etc. It was also recommended that EACH user group update their own records and include the address information of each user, past and present for a private database which Amiga would use to let people know that 'something wonderful is happening' and to keep an eye on the Amiga.

Developers and Dealers We  discussed  several  points  of  relevance  where keeping  developers  involved  was  concerned.  Jim &gt;

Collas said they would (or would consider) a 'sponsored development' (for lack of better terms) program whereby Amiga could be petitioned by established developers for financial assistance to complete a project or upgrade in return for some percentage. There  were  also  various  pointers  about  keeping dealers involved and perhaps Amiga organizing discounts on  products  for  Amiga  User  Groups  through  every available,  relevant  dealer  (not  just  Amiga  dealers,  but major  players  such  as  Yamaha  {speakers},  3Com {modems and network cards}, and others.) Overall,  most  every  point  was  designed  to  help every other part of the community (Amiga, user groups, developers, and vendors) bring in both memberships and interest.  It  is  also  designed  to  stop  the  slow  decline  of interest in User Groups and the Amiga in general. For the first time, as many there will attest, we really felt  like  Amiga  was  actually  listening  and  very,  VERY interested in what we had to say. During the meeting, &gt;

## Apr 24 -

Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am we got the distinct impression that we were hearing Jim Collas thinking out loud and that a lot of the feedback we provided came as a profound surprise to them. A lot of 'we  should  do  this'  and  such.  Later  Sunday,  I  was approached by a management member who stated that he  was  told  to  'be  sure  this  stuff  happens'  so  I  am actually psyched and waiting for stuff to happen.

Current Status The  current  status  is  that  we  (the  UGN  and Amiga.org)  are  working  towards  reaching  a  formal agreement with Amiga to handle and be recognized as the  central  location  for  Amiga  Organizations  as  per number 5 above (the ICOA voted to move their website to Amiga.org Friday at the show). The mailings (#1 above) aren't  expected  to  actually  start  until  mid  April,  which will give the UGN time to get its ducks in a row.

We need  to  start  assembling  and  submitting  user information to them ASAP.

Amiga is also in the midst of moving their offices from South Dakota to San Diego which has all the staff tied up at the moment with logistics. Once the Agreement is  reached  to  use  Amiga.org  for  organizations,  changes will  start  occurring  and  we  will  start  seeing  a  lot  more news items flowing from Amiga as they've designated a staff  member  specifically  to  disseminating  news  to  the community. Feedback is welcomed,
