## Amiga '99

## Make your plans

[Editor's Note: Since the Amiga '99 show is the closest large-scale  Amiga  show  to  the  Metroplex,  I  thought  I should include this notice for those of you who might be planning to attend again this year or for those who might attend if they had advance notice. St. Louis is only a 600 mile drive from here or, if you're flying, the price is much more reasonable than it is to someplace like Germany. Last year's show was attended by several club members and the information they returned with was very valuable for those of us who stayed at home. No doubt it's even better being there.]

The Amiga 99 Banquet tickets, for the March 13 Banquet, are  now available. Cost is $35 each plus an admission ticket  to  the  show.  Banquet  tickets  must  be  ordered  in advance. No banquet tickets may be sold at the show, due to the hotel requiring advance notice of the number of  people  attending.  Stay  tuned  for  the  list  of  guest speakers. Once the speakers are announced, tickets will go fast.

Although we have more room than last year, seating is limited.  Unlike  last  year,  we  will  only  accomodate  the number we can comfortably seat in the room, so order your tickets early.

Please note that there are no refunds on tickets.
