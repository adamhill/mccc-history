From: http://technology.news.com.au/techno/4197226.htm Title: Tenacious Amiga on comeback trail By Garth Montgomery, writing on 19 January

-  Gateway  expects  to  generate  $100  million  revenue from Amiga in the year 2000, and Mr Tyschtshenko is confident of meeting the target. The specifications call for an entertainment machine focused on multimedia games and real-time animation, Internet and networking support, plus digital interface standards for convergence processing hardware.
- However, demand {for Amigas} still exists, according to Mr. Tyschtshenko. He generated 10 million Deutschemarks ($9.5 million) in sales between March 1997 and December 1998, with only six staff selling A1200 machines developed in 1991.
- Revenue now comes mainly from poker machines and a  booming  wedding  video  industry  on  the  {Indian} sub-continent.

- ``Commodore never got in touch with the users of the computer,''  Tyschtschenko  said.  ``It's  important  to understand what people are doing. In the hard times, when I wasn't aware what was happening from day to day,  with  the  bankruptcy  I  got  encouraging  e-mails from users. They said `don't give up'. ``The community is very creative and I cared for these people.''
-  He  says  a  multimedia  workstation  based  around  the PowerPC chip  and  running  AmigaOS  3.5  could  sell next  year  for  less  than  $US1500  and  deliver  comparable performance to NT or Mac machines costing several  times  that  amount.  A  DVD-based  set-top interactive box with Net access is also planned.
-  ``Regarding  the  processor  platform,  I've  spoken  to Schindler and he told me they (Amiga Inc, the design

Dallas arm of Amiga) would like to make up their mind late in the  European  summer  for  processors.  ``There  are  so many things going on so they would like to grab the best technology they can.''

## From Jeff Schindler

Amiga has always had certain strengths  that  have never been matched by any other operating system. It's small, efficient, and  multimedia-centric. As Allan Havemose as often said, 'We just did it right.' Even today the Amiga can outperform and outrun today's dominant operating system. There  has  been  a  great  deal  of  excitement  and concern over the last few weeks about the future for the Amiga. With the recent announcement in Germany of our OS  partner  QNX  and  the  demonstration  of  what  this package  can  do,  we  began  speeding  forward  to  the future. When  Amiga  Inc.  was  formed  our  goal  was  to determine the best road for Amiga to take. We wanted to:

-  Continue  the  current  development  path  and  create another version of the operating system.
- Build a new team from scratch and re-write the OS with the new features necessary to be competitive.
- Locate an operating system with the same ideals and spirit that the Amiga has.

We joined in a partnership with QNX to create the NG Amiga.  But  that  didn't  mean  that  we  intended  to forget  about  the  classic  system  users  and  the  faithful Amiga community. We're going to continue working on getting 3.5 out the door, but we also need to get started working on the new operating system. We are committed to  a  long  and  exciting  future  for  the  Amiga,  and  the community  that  has  kept  this  magnificent  architecture alive. Amiga 3.5 is a work in progress; it has NOT been abandoned. We learned over the last several weeks, that what we believed we were getting from our partners in the  project  was  not  always  what  they  understood  they

were to deliver. So we are going back to each and every partner in the 3.5 project to make sure that what they are working on is what our customers require. It is critical that we deliver what we promised - a complete package.

Some of you have been concerned about the future of Amiga and our commitment to our developers and the community. Please know that your questions and e-mails have  not  been  ignored.  We  are  working  very  hard  to complete the final phases of 3.5 and get the developer programs  and  final  specifications  worked  out  with  our partner  QNX.  We  want  to  deliver  the  most  robust  and exciting operating system ever. We will do it.

Thanks for your patience and support. The Amiga is on the right path, and we look forward to delivering both 3.5 and the NG Amiga soon.

Keep the faith. We're close. Jeff Schindler General Manager Amiga Inc.
