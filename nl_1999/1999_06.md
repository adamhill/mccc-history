## Exodus Multimedia

## A new, local Amiga dealer/developer

Exodus Multimedia, a Dallas based video developer, was at  the  May meeting of the Amiga North Dallas chapter. They  are  the  producers  of  the  Maverick  Digital  Video Workstation which is a PC based machine. They have a strong  interest  in  the  Amiga  computer  and  were  at  the Gateway show where they had some one-on-one conversations with Amiga Inc. They have a developer status and plan to move their product to the new Amiga operating environment  as  soon  as  it  is  released.  They  gave  us  a number of insights  into  what  is  going  on  at  Amiga;  at least as much as they were able to without violating their non-dislosure agreements.

They were also kind enough to provide a door prize, Fire CD, which is a pyrotechnics display on CD-ROM. Ken Doll was the lucky winner.

Exodus is an Amiga dealer and they promised to keep us up to date as much as possible with late-breaking news about our favorite computer. …Ned Kelly

## News about Amiga-By-The-Loop

The  Amiga-By-The-Loop  chapter  is  about  to  loose  its home. June will be the last meeting at the Bell Helicopter Training Facility. They are turning classrooms into offices. Obviously, that means we'll be meeting at a new location in July. Problem is… we don't know where that will be yet.

Be sure to read the July AGM Connection for information on  when  and  where  our  chapter  will  be  meeting.  The information will also be available on our trusty AGM web site: http://www.startext.com/np/agm/. Just don't forget to check! In the meantime, we'll be looking for you in June at the same time, same place.
