## AmigaOS 3.5

## Martin Heine, AUGS

Here  are  some  more  details  regarding  OS  3.5  as revealed by Haage&amp;Partner at the AUGS meeting - as usual aimed as a piece of first info in Germenglish until someone  tells  you  all  this  in  an  official  statement  in correct English. Internet:  A  special  version  of  AWeb  will  be  the Browser (like I said) and the TCP/IP-stack will be Miami (unlike  I  said).  Integrated  Network-support.  The  E-MailAPI  and  the  simple  E-Mail-Client  will  be  from  the &gt;

author of Voodoo and New York.

Workbench:  Regarding  our  topic  'Moving  of  the Icons' was said that it wouldn't be necessary anymore to use the Shift-Key when moving more than one icon. An 'Unselect' will be possible when more than one icon is selected.  All  Preferences  programs  will  get  the  new Reaction-surface.  The  Submenus  of  the  WB  will  be optimized for a better handling.

Icon Library: When selecting, the icons will start to 'glow'; when dragging them they'll get semi-transparent. Via the 'Info' option it will now also be possible to set the process-priority. The current and the New Icons will be  supported.  The  AppIcons  will  now  be  able  to  be animated.

Reaction:  The  Tool  Reactor  will  enable  softwareauthors to use the new Reaction-surface with their own software. One of the highlights of Reaction is the possibility  to  have  a  color-gradient  in  the  background  of  a window. Also, bugs in the asl.library will be removed. &gt;
