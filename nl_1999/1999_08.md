## The Net Connection

## All that I couldn't fit here…

This is one of those months when I wish I were doing a twelve or sixteen page newsletter again. To begin with, Johnny  Kitchens  sent  in an excellent article  on ProfFileSystem 2 (PFS2). I tried for several hours to find a way to make it fit in this space, but finally had to give up. Check out the AGM web site for Johnny's review. All I can say is that I've added it to my list of things to buy in the near future. He made a believer out of me.

Of course, the big news is the news out of Amiga… that QNX is out and the Linux kernal is in. The shock waves still haven't settled down from that yet, with many people feeling  that  Linux  doesn't  have  as  much  to  offer  as à

QNX did. I'm not enough of a techie to know if that's true or not. I do know that keeping the Linux kernal current with the latest  hardware  drivers,  etc.  is  likely  to  be  an easier proposition, since there seems to already be a lot of interest in Linux in the computing world. To average users like you and I, what kernal is being used is of little importance. We'll never see it, just as we never see the Amiga kernal (the 3.1 ROM) that's there now. What we'll be  looking  for  is  a  top-notch,  ground-breaking  new interface that Amiga has been and is still promising, and blistering  fast  performance. Whether Amiga can deliver on the promise remains to be seen, but I don't see that the announcement of a different kernal has any bearing on the outcome at all. Speaking for myself, I'm still on the bandwagon and still waiting to plunk my money down on a new Amiga NG.

Anyway that's my two cents worth. For a collection of press releases, claims and counter-claims, and opinions

on the subject, check out the web site. If you're not up on the latest developments yet, you should be.

Of course, you'll also find the regular month's collection of files to download. We're no AmiNet, but there are a few gems to be had. And, of course, AmiNet doesn't have the collection of pictures that I put out there every month.

A preview of coming attractions… I am the proud owner of an Amiga 2000 and the not-quite-so-proud owner of a Compaq  Windows  '98  machine  (I  needed  the  PC  for work).  Ever  since  I  got  the  PC  (in  January),  I've  been trying to get it networked to my Amiga so that I can share files, move things back and forth, etc. It's not as easy to do as it might sound. As soon as I get one more piece of software (that should be in the mail to me now) I'll be ready to share my experiences and whatever knowledge I have gained. Look for a column in September.
