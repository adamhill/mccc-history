## Extravaganza Update Extravaganza Update

## Remember… September 25

Things are changing fast, so check the club web site for the latest information on the show. Exodus Multimedia, a local dealer/developer, will be at the show. Exodus will have classic Amiga OS items for sale, including the new 3.5 Operating System, if available. Currently, Exodus is working on the first Amiga MCC powered digital video workstation, Maverick! They hope to have the Maverick at the show.

Our club is working with the Austin Amiga users group, CTAS, to enhance the show. Several of their members will be attending and two have offered to give classes/demos on ARexx and Music-X, a music composition program. Amiga has agreed to send us an A1200 for the show. It will either be a door prize - or a raffle will be held to determine the new owner. It seems that 3.5 OS will be released later than originally planned. However, we are working on having a beta version at the show to demo.

We need your hardware and software to sell. Pick up Flea Market forms at the September meetings. Below is a list of collectors  for  flea  market  items  if  you  can't  attend  a meeting.

## Shakeup at Amiga

## Here we go again?

September 1, 1999 If  you  spend  much  time  on  the  Internet,  you  may  not need  this  special  short  issue.  For  those  who  haven't heard, as of today several news sites such as ZDNet and CNET  are  reporting  that  Jim  Collas  has  resigned  as President of Amiga. Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Tom Schmidt has been promoted to take over.

Here's a quote from the CNET story, written by Jim Davis: 'Collas,former senior vice president of global products for Gateway, has left Amiga after less than nine months on the job, Gateway spokesperson Brad Shaw confirmed. He is being replaced by Tom Schmidt, who joined Amiga in April as its senior vice president and COO.

Schmidt was formerly with AlliedSignal, a manufacturing and  technology  concern  in  the  market  for  aerospace products and services and automotive products.'

à

Separately, other web sites indicate that Bill McEwen is out as Amiga's contact to the press and users. This change apparently happened Tuesday.

It would seem we now know why the sudden change to quiet mode by Amiga. The only good news in all of this is the  reports  we've  seen  all  indicate  Amiga  intends  to continue with its existing plans. The question here is how close are those plans to what we all think they are? We'll find out over time.

'Amiga Update' will attempt to keep you informed about any  other  changes  at  Amiga  as  we  go  forward.  At  this point,  there's  no  information  available  at  Amiga's  web site.

## All that I couldn't fit here…

It's a few days late, but it's there - I finished my article on building an Amiga to PC LAN. You'll also find a show report  on  the  latest  World  of  Amiga,  Dave  Haynie's thoughts on the new Amiga MCC, and one person's view of Wintel PC's.

Of  course,  no  month  would  be  complete  without  a collection  of  exceptional  pictures  for  your  viewing pleasure.

Don't forget… this is Fleamarket Extravaganza month. See you on September 25!
