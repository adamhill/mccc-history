## Fleamarket Report

## Low Attendance - Lots of Fun

One of the main goals of last year's Extravaganza was to bring user groups in the region together. This year we put on our thirteenth annual computer Amiga show with the help and support of the Central Texas Amiga Computing Society  (CTAS)  in  Austin.  CTAS  was  able  to  obtain  an Amiga  1200  and  other  Amiga  items  from  Petro  in Germany. Both of our user's groups sold raffle tickets for the  A1200, and second and third place prize packages.

Unfortunately,  attendance  was  down  from  last  year.  A total of 28 people registered at the show, including Amiga enthusiasts from Houston, San Antonio, Austin and other Texas locales. Since a number of people did not resister, myself  included,  I  estimated  attendance  at  between  50 and 60.

There still was much to do at the show. The flea market was  the  largest  part  of  the  show.  A  wide  variety  of hardware  and  software  was  available  at  some  bargain prices. The club sold Amigawares shirts, caps and more on consignment from Randomize. The club still has a few caps  and  beach  balls  available  for  sale  at  the  club's monthly  meetings.  The  club's  Amiga  disk  library  was available  to  all.  The  Jay  Miner  Memorial  Tape  was available  for  sale  for  the  first  time  in  three  years  (if interested in a copy of the tape, contact Johnny Kitchens).

Donald Kassebaum from CTAS gave the demos on ARexx and  REBOL.  Donald  has  done  some  programming  on commercial software packages including a program in the flea market called Toaster Vision. Max Sappenfield, one of our own members, gave continuous demos about MIDI and the Amiga. I would like to thank Donald and Max for giving their time to present well received  presentations.

This  year  we  had  no  dealers  at  the  show.  Exodus Multimedia  initially  was  to  attend  but  canceled  one week before due to the uncertainly 'In light of current events of Amiga…' Show regular, Commodore  Country has gone out of business and did not attend the show.

The raffle for the A1200 was conducted at the end of the day. The A1200 was won by a brand new member to the club,  David  Baldock.  Second  and  third  place  prize packages  consisting  of  Amiga  posters,  stickers,  and playing  cards  were  awarded  to  current  member  Mark Siedle and former member David Campbell. Door prizes were graciously supplied by the club and club members. In fact, there were so many door prizes that at the drawing everyone went away with at least two door prizes!

I  would  like  to  thank  everyone  else  that  helped  at  the Extravaganza, many of whom helped in more than one area  (if  I  miss  anyone  I  am  sorry).  Okley  Moss  ran  the registration  table  and  gave  out  those  lucky  winning tickets.  Ned  Kelly  handled  the  club's  Amiga  software library.  Bill  Raecke,  Johnny Kitchens and David Owens helped  throughout  the  day  with  everything.  Alexander and Catherine Stodola, my children, sold drinks, snacks, magazines and raffle tickets for the club. Most of all, I would personally like to thank my wonderful wife Genie for putting up with me and helping the entire day. …Mark Stodola

## 3.5 Order Update

## It's on its way…

On  October  18 th ,  Amiga  finally  shipped  the  new  3.5 Operating System. Our order will ship from Software Hut by October 25 th and should arrive by the end of October or early November. I will send email or phone all with orders and leave a message on the BBS.

The  orders  will  be  available  at  each  of  the  monthly chapter meetings. Arrangements can be made to pick up your  order  from  my  home  in  Cedar  Hill.  Other  arrangements are possible.

If you have any questions, leave mail on the BBS, call me at  metro  (972)  299-6824  or  leave  me  an  email  at mstodola@airmail.net. …Mark Stodola

## The Net Connection

## All that I couldn't fit here…

Last month we got the word that Amiga / Gateway were abandoning plans to build the Amiga MCC. We were told that  the  direction  now  would  be  aimed  and  'internet appliances.'  You  might  have  expected  this  pronouncement to cause a furor among the Amiga faithful. If you did, you'd be right. It does seem, at this point, that the Amiga as we know it is at an end - at least so far as future  development  and  support  from  Gateway  is  concerned.

There is some hope that the Amiga will be given a rebirth by  a  group  of  developers  who  have  organized  as  the Phoenix Platform Consortium. And there's another group called  AROS  (the  Amiga  Research  Operating  System)

For lots of articles berating the Amiga / Gateway decision as well as some informative articles that explain in greater detail where the future may lie, check out this month's AGM web site. I should have it updated no later than the 1 st of  November. (It's a lot quicker to do with that new cable modem.)

In case you haven't looked recently, you'll also find some pictures  of  our  Fleamarket  Extravaganza  on  line  at  the AGM web site. You may even see yourself in some of the shots. My thanks to Johnny Kitchens and Dan Stockelman for the pictures.
