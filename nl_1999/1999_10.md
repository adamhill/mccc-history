## Executive Update

## New direction for Amiga

September 14, 1999 - Thanks for your notes and comments about our plans for Amiga. In the past couple weeks, we've received hundreds - if not thousands - of emails  and  messages  from  loyal  Amigans  worldwide, many of you expressing a concern about Amiga's future based on recent reports in the media and in numerous chat rooms. I am so impressed with the spirit and passion of this great community and I wanted to make sure I told you that. The  fact  is  -  to  borrow  from  Mark  Twain  -  the reports of Amiga's death have been greatly exaggerated. To that end, I wanted to provide a little more detail about our plans for Amiga… both as a product and as a company, and hopefully clear up any confusion that exists. First,  I  hope  you'd  agree  that  Amiga  was  never about  a  box.  It  was  never  about  an  operating  system either.  Sure  those  things  were  part  of  what  made  the original Amiga great, but at its heart, Amiga was simply about a better way. Amiga was ahead of its time. Amiga promised to change the world. It ran against conventional wisdom and was better than  anything  out  there  at  the time. In fact, we could all argue that it's still better than anything out there. The ideals and spirit of that original Amiga are alive and well today. But to limit Amiga to just one box, one product, one OS, is to keep Amiga from ever seeing its full potential. Think about it… The original Amiga never did  really  reach  its  full  potential  despite  its  technical advantages and its cost and ease of use advantages. Why? Because  it  never  became  ubiquitous.  The  company's early vision was probably too limited for the vast potential that Amiga offered. The original  Amiga  was  all  about  multi-media,  so why not  have  Amiga  running  on  every  type  of  device imaginable, on top of every other OS out there?  That's the  beauty  of  Amiga  and  where  we  are  as  an  industry. We're in the  midst  of  a  revolution  unlike  anything  the world has seen, and Amiga has never been better positioned to change that world and make a bigger impact. Limiting Amiga to just one box and one OS at this point

Dallas would  be  like  offering  the  world  a  better  horse  and carriage at the dawn of the automotive age. Amiga and its revolutionary  spirit  deserve  better  than  that.  Amiga  is going  to  produce  software  technology  that  will  enable Internet  services  on  an  emerging  category  of  products commonly referred to as 'Information Appliances.' It is an exciting new mega trend in the industry and we are excited  about  being  at  the  forefront  of  this  next  great wave in computing history. In addition, we have decided to  work  with  business  partners  who  will  deliver  our software technology on their systems, rather than enter the hardware business directly. So long live Amiga, but if you think that Amiga was just  a  box,  you've  missed  the  point.  Amiga  is  about  a better way. In the coming weeks and months, we promise to  keep  you  posted  on  progress  against  our  plans  for Amiga, and we thank you for your continued support. Let's work together to enable Amiga to revolutionize the industry and change the world! Thomas J. Schmidt President &amp; C.E.O.

## Executive Update Take Two

September 17, 1999 - There has been a great deal of confusion and frustration expressed in the news groups and via email over the past several weeks. I apologize that  we  have  not  been  more  direct  in  our  communications, and I want to set the record straight. First,  per  my  previous  messages,  I  continue  to  be impressed  with  the  passion  and  commitment  of  this community. You have 'hung in there' through a number of  upheavals  over  the  past  years,  and  through  several false  starts  on  next-generation  Amiga  platforms.  You deserve better. I have received many, many emails over the  past  two  weeks,  expressing  your  opinions  and frustrations. Let me try and summarize what I have heard. Many  of  you  acknowledge  the  fact  that  we  are focusing  on  software  for  the  coming  generation  of 'Internet appliances.' We are very excited about the new Amiga Operating Environment, the work we are doing with Linux (and other operating systems that support à

Java), and the huge growth curve in Internet appliances that we are going to ride. You have gracefully wished us well in this endeavor. For that, I thank you. As you know, we announced in July that we were pursuing the development  of  a  'multimedia  convergence  computer'  that would  serve  as  the  next-generation  Amiga  desktop computer. After the change in management at Amiga, we reviewed all our product plans. To be honest, the ability for us to deliver the MCC was unrealistic. Furthermore, I have  fundamentally  decided  that  it  would  be  better  to partner with a wide variety of hardware partners, rather than compete against them with a product of our own.

From  your  perspective,  one  big  problem  exists. Sounds great, but what does this new direction have to do with the original Amiga computer?  Quite honestly, nothing! We realize that this does not satisfy the desire of the  Amiga  community  for  a  next-generation  Amiga.  In response, I remain committed to seek out partners who are  interested  in  developing  a  next-generation  Amiga

computer and operating system. We have been following the  discussions  amongst  the  newly  formed  'Phoenix Platform Consortium' and talking to companies interested in supplying the next-generation Amiga. We are open to the possibility of licensing the MCC product specification and design that is now on the shelf to companies that are interested  in  further  developing  the  Amiga  desktop computer product line. We believe that this could be an attractive business opportunity for another company. In summary, we are continuing to focus our resour- ces on setting software standards for the coming generation of Internet appliances. We are not planning to offer hardware devices, but will work with hardware manufacturers  who  want  to  license  our  technology.  As  far  as offering next-generation Amiga systems, we are open to talking to companies who want to offer such a product. For  those  of  you  who  are  excited  about  the  Amiga Operating  Environment  running  on  a  wide  variety  of future Internet appliances, we invite you to track our à

progress  and  activities  over  the  coming  months.  The Internet  appliance  software  model  that  we  are  putting together  will  open  up  an  exciting  new  era  of  software development that we think will be very interesting to the type of innovative thinkers who were drawn to the Amiga computer in years past.
