## Changes at Amiga

## A new president and fast-track plans

SAN DIEGO, Calif. - February 26, 1999 In a series of meetings in San Diego, representatives of Amiga Inc. and Amiga International met to hammer out the  details  of  technical,  strategic  and  marketing  plans which will see the launch of a range of new Amiga-based computers  for  the  next  millennium.  The  company  has relocated its  headquarters to San Diego and Jim Collas will be serving as the new president of Amiga. 'Amiga is an amazing opportunity that we must act on  now  or  it  will  be  lost  forever,'  said  Collas.  'The Amiga™  platform  is  ideal  for  Internet-ready,  consumeroriented digital appliances of the future. The Amiga name is associated the world over with user-friendly, low cost, powerful computing. We will take this philosophy into the  next  generation,  enabling  products  from  hand  held Internet appliances to high-end graphics computers that help the user rather than frustrate them.' Collas, formerly a senior vice president for Amiga's parent  company,  Gateway,  will  be  running  Amiga  as  a wholly  independent  subsidiary  operation  and  will integrate Amiga Inc. and Amiga International under the new Amiga corporate structure. His leadership will allow the company to step up a fast-track development program that is currently underway. Amiga  is  planning  to  launch  next  generation products worldwide before the New Year. They will be announcing  detailed  product  plans  and  introducing several  of  their  strategic  partners  over  the  summer. Products  currently  targeted  for  the  initial  launch  are  a development system,  an  Internet  appliance,  and  a  low cost home computer in the tradition of the Amiga A500 that dominated home computing in the late eighties and early nineties. The developer's system will be available with a software development suite for low cost development on the new platform. Jeff  Schindler,  in  charge  of  product  strategy  for Amiga,  is  planning  the  new  Amiga  product  line.  'The Amiga community has been doing incredible things on a platform  which  hasn't  had  an  official  update  in  eight years,' said Schindler. 'They deserve a system which lets

Dallas them show off their talents.' Amiga's  administrative  center  in  San  Diego  will shortly  be  complemented  by  a  software  development center under the leadership of Dr. Allan Havemose, vice president  of  Engineering  for  Amiga,  in  San  Jose, California.  The  Silicon  Valley  team  will  be  rapidly  expanded over the coming months to develop revolutionary Amiga multimedia layers over the real-time Neutrino OS core from QNX Software Systems Ltd. Petro Tyschtschenko will continue on as managing director  of  Amiga  International  and  will  also  play  a critical  role  in  guiding  the  current  Amiga  community through  the  transition  to  the  new  Amiga  architecture. 'The new Amiga plans are a rebirth for Amiga and an exciting journey into the future,' said Tyschtschenko.

## Amiga OS 3.5 Orders

## A message from Mark Stodola

As  everyone  knows,  the  release  of  the  new  3.5 Operating System (OS) is eminent. A few months ago, the Board of Directors of the MCCC decided to see if there was enough interest from club members to make a group purchase of OS 3.5. The reason being is to be among the first  to  receive it, and to possibly get a discount. I have received orders for 10 copies so far. It  appears  that  it  will  be  released  during  the Gateway Amiga '99 Show in St. Louis. Johnny Kitchens and I will be attending the show. If it is available at the show, we will purchase OS 3.5 for club members. We cannot promise a discount, but the more orders we have, the better our chances will be. If  you  have an interest in placing an order for OS 3.5 let me know as soon as possible. The Gateway Amiga '99 Show starts Friday, March 12. If OS 3.5 is not avail-

## The Net Connection

The recent developments at Amiga are enough to get any Amiga fan smiling. But it seems that, other than that good news, there isn't a lot of news out there. This month's entries seem a little light in comparison to other recent months.

In addition to the articles printed here, this month's web site will feature information on the upcoming upgrade to the  venerable Amiga archiver, LhA. And, of course, I'll have my software (and picture) choices for the month as well. Downloads of my monthly favorites are available at the web site throughout the month.
