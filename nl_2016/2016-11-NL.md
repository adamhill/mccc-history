## Podcast 47 Edo Demo Miyako

The prologue:

The last time I reviewed the Amiga Vibes podcast was Episode 37. Some might be asking how did I miss nine episodes? Well in 2015 when I started listening to the podcasts there were only 5 episodes released that year (Episodes  31  to  35)  with  release  dates  in  January, September, two in October, and December.

To be honest, a few episodes downloaded which I listened to or started to listen to. Then today where the last episode I saw was from June, suddenly there were five episodes that my iTunes had not picked up before from July, two from August, two from September, and the newest one from October that I will review today.

Seeing how the podcasts are released in feast and famine, and I've only reviewed episodes 36, 37, and 47 so far, this will be a regular feature going forward.

End Prologue.

Here is the tracklist of this podcast (And also my review of these tracks in the playlist-Doctor Clu):

00:00 Jingle by JGG - AmigaVibes (0'26)

00:29  North  Of  Neverland-  RTXEagleEye/RTX1911 (3'14)

03:37 Delusive City- kensukeShimoda (3'56)

Dallas

- 08:51 Fresh Verdure-kazpulse (3'33)
- ****  As  the  name  suggests  a  more  fresh  mellow  piece with a slight beat.
- 12:18 Devicehigh-mino/miu-point (1'52)
- ***    Techno racing style music.
- 14:07 Confused train-machia / MachiaWorks (4'14) ***  Good  piano  piece,  techno  beat  in  the  background gets a bit repetitive.
- 18:14 Save our Planet-FL1NE (T\_S)/RTX1911 (3'04) **** Electronic voice nice, dance beat song.
- 21:19  SID-OVERHEAVEN-Jugem-T/DSdA  /  Atmosphere (2'15)
- *** Synthsized Orchestral. Ugg. Chiptunes but not overdone.  Kinda epic sounding.
- 23:31 Overrun!-Wilsynth (3'30)
- ***  A  cute  retro  sounding  piece.    Sounds  like  a  C=64 could have done it.  Low volume.
- 26:55 Tirana-Cutting Nation / kazpulse + Mi-2 (2'08) **** Good active mix of music samples in a moderately paced tune.
- 28:57 Inverted Core-hadhad / had2apps (5'00) ** Epic beginning, an ok tune, but a bit disjointed. In the end becomes noise.

* Background alternates between two notes for the longest.
- 35:46 GAIA-P'ce/Cutting Nation (2'56)
