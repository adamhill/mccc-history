## Amiga Music

AmigaVibes  released  another  podcast of Amiga produced music on January 17, 2016.  Below  are  the  track  names  and my reviews.

Podcast 36 - Alchimie 0xb - Jayblood

Duration: 26'59

Created between November 13 to 15 in the digital recreation area with the Alchemy  0xb  in  Tain  l'Hermitage  in  the Drome.

Here is a mix of music in the musicdisk Jayblood realized in the coding party.

Here is the tracklist of this podcast:

- AmigaVibes Jingle (0'26)
- Amphetamines (2'30) A  chiptune  track.  Energetic.  Electronica.
- Ballade in Nantes (3'04) Starts at 2:52. This is more the new age  type  of  music  I  like.  A  good track to drive to at night.
- Nightmare (3'06) Starts at 5:57 - This is another new age type with more bass beats to it.
- Night flight (2'35)
- Starts at 9:02. This reminds me of the  music  you  would  hear  in  80's sci-fi shows that depicted what future music would be.  :D A bit of a Daft Punk feel.
- Again naked as a glass (7'38) Starts at 11:35. A steady meditative piece.
- Patience (3'59)
- Starts at 19:12. If you have the 'patience' to get through the intro this one  spins  up  to  an  eerie  musical piece with a beat.
- Moon theme (3'57) Starts  at  23:01.  As  you  might  expect,  a  tune  that  seems  to  ponder the moon floating in the sky.

## February 2016

So my personal favorites this goaround would be Ballade in Nantes and Night  Flight,  but  who  knows,  some  of these  other  ones  might  be  more  your speed.

## Amiga Source Code Leak

There have been a handful of developments in the Amiga-and-related world, but there are a couple I'd like to focus upon  this  time.  One,  there  is  a  public repository for source code of the Odyssey Web Browser, AKA OWB. OWB is a Webkit-based  browser  with  versions semi-separately developed for  most Amiga  family  platforms,  the  MorphOS version  being  one  of  the  most  developed.  Having  source  code  shared  and centralized  will  hopefully  boost  development across all versions, and maybe boost the Amiga/Morph/AROS systems' web browsing powers in general.

In  a  separate  but  related  bit  of  news, source  code  for  the  classic  Amiga  OS (version  3.1)  was  leaked,  presumably illegally,  to  file  sharing  and  torrent sources. Hyperion went on record that their OS4 is safely un-leaked. It would seem Cloanto, who holds a pretty-much exclusive license on the classic OS versions, would be the most directly affected,  though  there's  also  the  possibility that  someone  unscrupulous  could  use the code to create a 'Trojan' version of

the OS which could hide malware for Amiga systems or even another system running  that  Amiga  OS  under  emulation.  This hasn't been the first leak of this  type,  and  likely  won't  be  the  last. The Amiga OS, classic or otherwise, has limited  power  to  make  money  nowadays, so I doubt this will have much of an  effect  on  the  market  either  way. Even Cloanto probably sells more Amiga  Forever  packages  on  the  convenience  of  having  emulator,  Amiga  OS, and software configured together than any exclusivity.

Perhaps it's time for those who control the  intellectual  property  that  is  the classic Amiga OS to just 'own' this leak and officially  release  the  source  code publicly. As I see it, the potential benefits outweigh the downsides. For example,  since  the  source  code  is  said  to include  that  of  the  Amiga  Kickstart ROM,  bug  fixes  and  enhancements could be added to the Kickstart and a new ROM could be created, like would normally  be  applied  with  software patches,  or  like  having  the  3.5  or  3.9 system  in  ROM  from  the  start.  This may not be so appealing to those who would have to open their old systems and swap out a chip, but it could be a boon to those who develop 'new classic' systems in hardware or emulation. Something  akin  to  an  Amiga  500  or 1200 which can use or boot from new terabyte-size hard drives or USB devices or SD cards without requiring extra software drivers could be quite appealing. Perhaps it could even go so far as to use all new CPUs or graphics hardware, which could still be classic-compatible and maybe even run metal-banging old hardware, as the abstraction layer is part of a low level in Kickstart.  I'm sure someone with experience  will  tell  me  why  that's  either very difficult or totally impossible, but you  might  never  know  for  sure  until you  try.  Developments  in  'new  old'

Amiga  Kickstarts  and  operating  systems could be shared in the community, and build upon one another to make an ultimate classic OS, though it may blur the lines between the 3.X classic Amiga systems  and  'next  gen'  ones  such  as OS4,  MorphOS,  or  AROS.  If  developments in one arena can go to enhance another, it can't be all bad though.

I strongly advocate the release of source  code  for  any  Amiga  software which might otherwise be abandoned-not just operating systems, but productivity  applications  and  games too. Some apps, such as Aladdin 4D and Personal Paint, have been 'bought out' for  future  development  for  OS4  and others,  which  is  a  start,  but  we  could use  more,  whether  it  be  commercial development  or  releasing  the  source code  for  free  public  development.  It would  be  nice  to  see  Deluxe  Paint  or Brilliance or Moviesetter or Photogenics brought up to modern standards, running on newer hardware. Some software has moved on to other platforms like  Windows  and  Mac  and  continue there, so there is little incentive to release sources, but I'd still be tickled to see sources for the old Amiga versions of TV Paint, Cinema 4D, or the venerable  Lightwave  3D  to  continue  life  in public  hands.  I  wouldn't  expect  it  to cause any real competition or issues for the  Windows  software  with  an  extra decade or two of updates under its belt. Mostly  it's  just  selfishness.  I'd  like  to see and use the software I already enjoy,  but  with  more  features  or  power afforded  by  new  hardware  and  ideas. Regardless, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.

## Broadband Definition Too Fast?

Last  year  the  FCC  had  us  all  rejoicing when  it  upped  the  minimum  requirements  for  broadband  from  4Mbps  to 25Mbps. It  means  that  many  Internet service providers can no longer classify their service as broadband. So while it didn't instantly improve speeds, it did shame ISPs and cost them in tax breaks and grants that come with this classification.

What's  good  for  us  isn't  good  for  telecoms and their puppy dogs in congress. While we all high-fived each other and talked  about  how  we  were  one  step closer to competing with the South Koreans in how many K-dramas we could stream at once, six United States Senators  looked at the FCC announcement and they said NOPE. Then they waited a few months before getting together to pen a letter to the FCC.

The Senators? Steve Daines (R-MT) Roger Wicker (R-MS) Roy Blunt (R-MO) Deb Fischer (R-NE) Ron Johnson (R-WI) Cory Gardner (R-CO)

These  six  are  smart  men.  Real  smart. They went to college and have degrees and they know how much Internet an average  household  needs.  It  ain't  the 25Mpbs Tom Wheeler, Chairman of the FCC,  announced.  That's  too  fast!  Too much speed.

'We  are  concerned  that  this  arbitrary 25/3 Mbps benchmark fails to accurately capture what most Americans consider broadband,' they said in their letter.

Well  yes.  Less  than  1  in  4  Americans24.3 percent to be exact-have access to  speeds  higher  than  15Mbps.  Bully for  them,  but  that  means  that  more than 75 percent of the  population hasn't even come close to experiencing broadband  speeds.  Of  course  they're not  going  to  define  25Mbps  as  broadband. That's like expecting a peasant in Elizabethan England to define clean as 'not wreaking of excrement and general filth.'

In their letter, sent to Tom Wheeler and the FCC on January 21, 2016, the senators  note  that  'we  are  aware  of  few applications that require  download speeds of 25 Mbps.'

'Netflix,  for  examples,  recommends  a download speed of 5 Mbps to receive high-definition  streaming  video,  and Amazon  recommends  a  speed  of  3.5 Mbps.' This is very true. They do recommend those speeds. For one stream. In one home. If three different people live in  a  home  and  watch  three  different shows?  That's  15Mbps  and  10.5Mbps needed respectively.

If those same people want to enjoy entertainment  on  their  new  4K  TV-because  that  is  almost  exclusively  the kind  of  television  currently  available for  purchase.  They  will  need  25Mbps for a single stream.

But hey, these Senators are just looking out for you. They know what's best because  they  can  find  the  lowest  speed requirement on the Netflix site.

And they know what's best for all you folks living in the bumtits of nowhere. Way back in 2010 the FCC launched a new program called the Connect America Fund. This was designed to help improve speeds in rural America. At the time  companies  could  receive  subsidies if they provided speeds of 4Mbps.

This was upped in 2014 to 10Mbps after a little battle with ISPs. They were peeved about the new requirement. It was not, officially, upped to 25Mbps in 2015  when  Wheeler  announced  the new definition for broadband.

The  senators  point  this  out,  because 'we would remind you that the FCC is tasked with implementing policies and procedures that advance universal service-ensuring all  Americans  have  access to comparable service at comparable rates.'

They don't actually want anything. Except to complain about the discrepancy and  say  that  it's  not  fair.  Also  they stamp their feet a lot. But, you know, in letter form.

These  Senators  are  incredibly  short sighted and it's clear that they haven't done any research or read any periodicals  or  spoken  to  any  experts  beyond the lobbyists begging them to write this letter in the first place. Their letter suggests  that  they  operate  in  a  vacuum where Netflix isn't nearly 40-percent of all  Internet  traffic  and  4K  televisions aren't rapidly increasing their marketshare and their own constituents aren't clamoring for better access to the Internet.

Particularly egregious is that these senators are all from relatively rural states where the Internet, when available, is slow  and  expensive  and  competition between ISPs is virtually non-existent. There are 3 millions residents of Mississippi and only 34-percent of those residents have Internet speeds of 10Mbps or  higher.  But  sure  senators,  the  real problem is Tom Wheeler trying to hold the  ISPs  to  some  kind  of  reasonable standards.

Read the senators' entire letter here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/2967121 34/Republican-Letter-to-FCC-Concerning-Broadband. Bonus points if you can see  where  they  just  copy  and  pasted sentences from ISP lobbyists.

## Amiga Developments This Month

Hello again. Welcome back to my ramblings  of  things.  I  hope  you  all  had  a good Western New  Year.  Between Christmahanakwanza and The western New Year it would seem that somebody 'leaked' the source code of AmigaOS 3.1 and additional  content  dating  back  to

1994. Nothing that was leaked effects AmigaOS 4, but there are many speculating this is going to hurt Hyperion. I don't exactly see why it would. I guess we'll have to see. Hyperion is investigating  it  and  I  would  suspect  Cloanto might  be  too  as  the  current  owners. Oddly,  while  torrents  would  be  near impossible to kill, this can still be found on legit code sites like GitHub.com. In honesty  the  whole  thing  seems  a  bit staged in some ways.

For  the  Programmers  in  AmigaOS  4 there  is  a  new  version  of  StormC5ED. This is a code editor for the new Amigas only it seems. Most of the support in it seems  to  be  for  C/C++.  Sadly  I  don't think  I  can  use  that  as  C/C++  is  just whacked to me. That said there is another tool out, PortablE r6 beta. This is a  recreation  of  the  AmigaE  programming  language.  There  have  been  improvements  made  in  it  though.  It's supposed to work on MorphOS, AROS, and  OS4.  You  could  use  it  on  an  AmigaOS 3.x system but it would have to be a very powerful one to handle compiling. While earlier versions of this were more  for  existing  AmigaE  programmers, this one is hoping to attract new users to it. To use this you need a working  copy  of  GCC  for  compiling  to  an executable.  From  what  I  can  find  the way this one works is it translates your AmigaE into C++. I never learned AmigaE but I have to say this might be interesting.

and  that  is  from  the  original  authors' homepage http://www.sasg.com/ Registration  uses  PayPal.  If  you  already have the old 3.8 key you're already set. Remember  me  mentioning  GetHub? Well you can also find the new Odyssey Web  Browser  Public  Source  Code  Repository. Since it is public anybody can now  work  on  OWB.  Whether  this  is good or bad depends on how they handle  it  I  suppose.  for  those  interested you can find this at: h t t p s : / / g i t h u  b  .  c  o  m  /  d  e  a  d  w  o  o  dpl/OdysseyWebBrowser.  One  of  the things you can find is the latest source code which is 1.25. MorphOS 3.9 shipped  with  1.23.  Also  available  for Morphos: SimpleMail v0.42. Supposedly it will also work with the Gmail/Google  IMAP4  servers.  To  do this one has to activate the 'less secure Option'  in  Gmail.  I  know  some  folks prefer this one but I think I'm going to stick to YAM.

Another  item  for  MorphOS:  OnyxSoft celebrated their 20th revolution about the  vile  evil  Daystar  this  year.  As  a Christmahanakwanza gift for their supporters they have given us RecentFiles.sbar v1.0. It's a small screenbar module that will notify you about  new  files  for  MorphOS.  It  tells you  recent  changes  from  MorphOS Files Portal as well as MorphOS releases from the MorphOS Team.

Now then, something I am interested in is  that  MUI  version  4.0-2015R4  for AmigaOS4/PPC  and  AmigaOS3/m68k has come out. The site is not the original, but has his permission to distribute it. As always you don't get full functionality for it unless you buy a key,

A very busy end and start to the years. This  is  the  kind  of  busy  I  like  though. Here  is  to  hoping  that  this  year  is  a good one for us all.
