## A New Classic Amiga?

There have been a few bits of news in the Amiga sphere of influence, though their relative bigness is up to your own opinions. Mike covers several news items in his column, and I'll pick out a few more. A-EON technology is testing out their 'Tabor' PPC main board,  which  is  slated  for  use  in 'A1200'-series Amiga/OS4 systems. The board is supposed to be low-cost (relative to AmigaOne X1000/X5000 at least, and while not exactly high spec, it boasts some appealing interfaces, including SATA drives, HDMI video, and a MicroSD card used to hold the system ROM, if not the entire OS in the future. While it's not exactly my cup of tea, I could see it being an exciting system for some, especially if the price is right.

Of much greater interest to me is the rews (somewhere between rumor and legitimate news) that an official MorphOS port of Personal Paint 7.x is coming, which I sincerely hope comes to pass. I use PPaint 7.1 frequently on the Amiga, and while the program runs on MorphOS, it is at best 'quirky' with not all features operating properlyeven the new 7.3 versions from A-EON are reported to behave the same way. A  version  that  works  properly  on Morph would be welcome, whether PPC native or not, and I'd be willing to pay for a copy, provided it works as advertised of course.

I'll finish up with a bit of speculative holiday wish-listing. Some time back, it was reported that Jens of Individual Computers  was  buying  up  pretty much all remaining stock of loose Amiga AGA chip sets, essentially cornering

the market (if there is one). Hints and rampant speculation point to the idea of 'new classic' Amiga boards. While the exact nature of what comes to pass (or if it does at all) is unknown, I know what I'd  like  to  see,  even  though  I know I wouldn't have in in time for Christmas. I would like to see something directly Amiga-compatible, running OS 3.X with whatever tweaks or additions are required to accommodate  the  updated  board.  The  CPU could be modular and go from 68020 (or equivalent) for basic A1200 compatibility to something that meets or exceeds the power of a 68060, while sticking with direct 680x0-family compatibility. The board should have modern interfaces, such as SATA and/or SD/MicroSD for drives, USB, Ethernet (wireless?) and video out via HDMI and/or DVI with flicker-fixing of the NTSC and PAL screens. Even better would be to also include expansion for extra video cards (or include a basic PC video chipset on the board) easily switchable between PC and AGA displays thru the operating system. Of course lots of RAM and drive space are necessary, but that is probably almost a given. Maybe it's a pipe dream, and things like emulation are undoubtedly far cheaper but I'd be happy to keep the idea of a new take on an old Amiga on my Xmas list for years to come.

## What's New for Amiga?

Another year has gone by and much has happened all over. I think something we should do at the meeting is just a look back at the events. A reminder of what we have and such.

A-eon and Amigakit are soon to be releasing a new 'Enhancer kit' for AmigaOS 3.x and the PPC AmigaOS 4.1. Not sure how well it would work on a MorphOS machine. Hard to say. Some of the software offered in this could be  helpful  on  the  older  machines though. There is a partial list of what is in it on Amiga.org. What I can see are a collection of applications, utilities, datatypes and classes. It's supposed to be available soon. The store page for it, however, is still blank except to say coming soon.

Commodore Free, issue 90, is now available for download. This has gotten to be a great source for things Amiga as well as the C64 and a number of other Commodore machines. Issue 90 was released on November 29th. In addition to the price and the sheer amount of content, I think one of the things I like most on this is how they kept it readable for all. Way too many places seem to want the latest and greatest formats. Even when dealing with users of the older machines. Placing everything in Flash is just silly to be honest. I'll let you discover on your own what they have. As usual you  can  find  it  at http://www.commodorefree.com/

'The Dream of Rowan' is a new game for the 68K Amigas. It's in kickstarter at this point near as I can see for it. You need 2M of chip ram and an 020

for the game, although they recommend an 030. What I can find on this suggests it's old style pixel art. I don't think I'll be looking into this one.

For MorphOS there is a new player for Android. They include a site that has a few of these. Not sure what I think on this one. It's cute I guess but I'd imagine using an android device would be easier and nicer.

The new AmiCloud client is now available for MorphOS. Right now it costs about $11. i think you get like 2Gb at this point with it still in Beta. It allows you to move files between MacOSX and some Linux. I have to think there are easier ways to do this. Maybe for passing  things  over  a  distance  between systems, but even then I don't see the value in this. I would think an FTP client  could  achieve  the  same thing for less and be easier.

## An Amiga 500 Emulator

A nostalgic Google researcher recently flexed his C coding skills and built a fully functional Commodore Amiga 500 emulator for Chrome. You can try the realistic software here: pnacl-amiga-emulator.appspot.com/. It's good, geeky fun.

Of course, it's also a handy way to flaunt some of Chrome's lesser known features.  The  Amiga  emulator  was built with Native Client, a C and C++ sandbox for Chrome. Said nostalgic researcher,  Christian  Stefansen, worked on the tool, so he's showing off a little bit and notes that the emulator is 'something like 400,000 lines of code.' Or so.

'On the main page you can boot the Amiga, insert floppy disks, play the games, and generally pretend it's still the late 80s,' he explains in the site's FAQ. '(We recommend some Enigma music or the soundtrack from the movie Top Gun in the background.)'

So open Chrome and go nuts. RoboCity awaits.

## Coleco Chameleon

If you were a gamer in the early '80s, you've  no  doubt  played  ColecoVision-the  short-lived  console  that brought arcade games to your living room. Well, get ready for a nostalgia hurricane,  because Coleco is back on the scene with a new home console-and it'll play actual game cartridges.

The hero of this comeback story is called Coleco Chameleon. This 21stcentury console will play 20th-century 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit titles. There will also be brand new games with similar  graphics  available,  too,  so Coleco is smartly cashing in on the popularity of retro-style 2D titles that have been hits on all platforms from smartphones to Steam.

'It's  ironic  that  a  new  'retro'  video game system would actually revolutionize  and  revitalize  the  Coleco brand,' said Coleco partner Chris Cardillo, in a press release. The project's a collaboration between Coleco and a company called Retro Video Game Systems.

No price comes with this announcement, but it'll hit shelves in 2016, and it'll be shown at Toy Fair New York 2016 in February.
