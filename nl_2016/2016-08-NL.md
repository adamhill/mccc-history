## Image Processing Software

I'm still hoping to get my hands on a  Vampire  2  board,  and  by  extension the most powerful Amiga 600 in creation, but I still haven't heard back from any of my queries. I understand  Kipper2K,  who  handles board building and sales, is presumably swamped with orders, but it's no less frustrating to  someone who'd  just  like  to  hear  back  on some  ordering  questions.  According to Kipper's website updates, the Altera FPGA chip at the heat of the board  has  more  than  doubled  in price  after  the  company  was  acquired by Intel, which will affect the price  and/or  availability  of  future Vampire boards. I suppose I'll have to  start  asking  around  regarding the board to see if my questions are being "lost in the mail," or ignored because  I  haven't  followed  some unwritten  or  at  least  un-obvious rule.

On a separate note. I am still working on my '31st anniversary' (now) Amiga animation project. I'm finishing up the last of the drawn animation (good thing too, as I'm running out of  punched paper) and I'm on track  to  finish  up  this  project  a mere  year  later  than  my  original hoped-for date of completion (which was admittedly far too ambitious  for  a  single  person).  I'll  be sure to let everyone know when it's done and where to find it once it is.

Last month I did a rundown of paint software  I've  had  experience  with in  my  long  Amiga  career.  Now  I'll list  off  examples  of  software  I've used in the category known as 'image processing.' For the uninitiated, the primary focus of image processing  is  converting  image  files  between different formats, sizes/resolutions, and color depths, along with applying color or graphic  effects,  often  over  the  entire  image. As I mentioned in last month's article, software from this category may share features with other categories such as paint programs, and vice-versa,  and  'image  processing' is  a  term  with  a  rather  vague  and fluid definition to start with.

One of the the first programs in the category  I  experienced  was  called 'Butcher',  by  Eagle  Tree  Software. Its primary purpose was to reduce the resolution or number of colors in a given image file, with minimal loss of quality (hence the name). Its utility was rather limited, and later became redundant as other graphic software gained more features, and Butcher's  function  could  be  handled in nearly any paint program.

An  early  big  step  in  Amiga  image processing  software  was  'The  Art Department' by ASDG software, also  know  by  its  acronym  TAD.  Putting up an interface full of buttons on  a  blue  low-res  screen,  TAD  allowed you to load graphics in a variety  of  formats,  convert  their  size, resolution, or  number  of  colors (matching palettes with other images if needed), and save them out in

whatever  Amiga  mode  you  like. What made TAD special at the time is the image data was held in memory  at  full  24-bit  depth,  which  allowed  the  best  possible  quality when converting down to HAM or 32  or  16  color  images  with  pixel dithering  to  obfuscate  the  palette limits.  Not  surprisingly,  this  approach  used  a  lot  of  memory  (2 megabytes or more were strongly recommended), and TAD used an annoying Apple-like scheme where  the  program  allocated  all the RAM it could use (user-selected)  at  loading,  regardless  of  how much it actually needed at the moment. It also didn't let you see the image you were working on unless you  rendered  it  out  to  an  Amiga display. Still, especially at the time, it was an extremely powerful tool which yielded strong results. Later, ASDG  would  release  Art  Department Professional, or ADPro, which added many features which were  separately-sold  plugins  for TAD,  and  more  besides,  adding more  color  and  image  modifiers, the ability to composite two images together, and the options to save in most of the same file formats it could load. The interface was also swapped  from  blue  to  gray.  The last version of ADPro was version 2.5,  which  overhauled  the  interface from its clunky lowres buttons to a standard Amiga style screen of windows listing formats and image operators,  which  worked  nicely with  24bit  video  cards.  While  it still held on to some of the quirks of its roots, like requiring a render operation to see the image you are working with, it's  still  a  powerful image tool, if a bit archaic in certain ways.

Another in the 'big three' of Amiga image  processing  was  Imagemaster from Black Belt systems. I had relatively  little  direct  experience with  this  program  myself.  There were versions of the program that worked specifically with video hardware like HAM-E and the Opalvision board. I recall Imagemaster's interface being sort of a hybrid between the paint/processing mix of ImageFX  and  the  button  boxes  of early  ADPro,  with  an  intention  to out-feature them both. If any other image processor had an image operator or other feature, you could be assured  Imagemaster  would  have it in some form, though you might be hard-pressed  to find exactly what  you  want  through  the  labyrinth  of  buttons.  While  it  was  undoubtedly  powerful,  I  didn't  find Imagemaster particularly enjoyable to use.

The  third  of  the  OG  image  processor trio  was ImageFX by Nova Design. Early versions of the program ran on an Amiga screen, and let you preview your image on the screen (usually HAM mode) as you worked  on  it,  and  later  versions could do the same in 24 bit on systems with video cards. Where ADPro was geared toward conducting operations  over  an  entire  image, ImageFX could do so over a partial selected area of the image as well. Rudimentary  paint  program  fea- tures were included as well as the image  conversions,  effects,  transformations, warps, titling, color changes,  and  what  have  you.  ImageFX was one of the longest-lived Amiga image processing programs, and  was  able  to  make  use  of  the speed  boost  of  PowerPC  accelerator  cards  on  processor-intensive operations.  The  last  version  was 4.5 'Studio,' but development rights to  ImageFX  were  picked  up  by  AEON in  2015,  so  there  may  be  future life in the old software yet. It's worth noting that both ADPro and ImageFX  (and  presumably  Imagemaster too) had an interface for the AREXX script language, and included extra interfaces to facilitate creating  scripts  for  batch  processing or  complex  and  repetitive  operations, to cut down on repeated button-pushing for the user.

I had covered these in last month's paint programs segment, but Photogenics and FXPaint double as image processors, having nearly as many effects and operations as a dedicated processor, and the added benefit of being able to apply these effects to a 'paint layer' (taking cues from PC  and  Mac  software  like  Photoshop) in a very versatile way. Cloanto's Personal Paint has a handful of image processing operations as well,  albeit  limited  to  a  maximum of 256 colors. If your image processing needs are limited to simple conversions or scaling, you could do so using  an  image  viewer  such  as Showgirls,  which  offers  basic  con-

versions and batch processing, which  can  save  a  little  time  compared  to  firing  up  a  full  software package  for  a  simple  task.  There are  several  other  programs  in  the image  processing  category  I  neglected to mention, as I had no personal  experience  with  them.  I'm sure they're all great too. I'll catch you next time, with a new rundown on  2D  animation  software.  Stay tuned!

## Hard  Drive Writes Information One Atom At a Time

Researchers working in the Netherlands  have  developed  an  atomic scale  rewritable  data-storage  device  capable  of  packing  500  terabits onto a single square inch. Incredibly,  that's  enough  to  store every book written by humans on a surface the size of a postage stamp. Holy shit.
