## Amiga Paint Software

In a hopefully not completely misguided  article  idea,  I  thought  I  would write about some of the Amiga paint software I've used over the system's history.  For  those  less  familiar  with paint  programs  on  the  Amiga,  they are  usually  divided  into  two  main types,  though  the  line  between  the two  can  be  blurred.  'Register-based' or  'color-mapped'  programs  use  a limited palette of user selected colors, generally  from  2  to  256  registers which,  when  modified,  change  any parts  of  the  image  that  use  them. These types of programs are especially useful for simpler or stylized works, like cartoons, print art or game graphics. The other main type is 'HAM' or 'color  space'  paint  software,  which paints based on the entire 4096 possible  colors  the  original  Amiga  could display, up to over 16 million shades of 24 bit graphics and beyond, even if the system itself may not be capable of showing them all. These programs are  ideal  for  complex  or  subtle  full color  images,  such  as  photographs, but  don't  normally  offer  the  same 'low-level'  modification  the  as  register-based  programs.  As  I  mentioned previously,  some  software  sticks  to one  type,  others  may  offer  features from both sides, and a few try to offer it all, probably failing to do so well.

The first Amiga paint program I ever used  was  'The  Graphics  Studio'  by Accolade  software.  It  was  a  decent basic paint program,  but  did  not make  use  of  all  screen  resolutions (the  interlaced  modes  were  notably absent).  It  was  notable  for  being  a

port of (or possibly developed along side)  an  Apple  IIGS  program,  so  its interface  was  much  like  the  GS  and Mac software of the time. Later would come the Deluxe Paint series, created by Dan Silva and Electronic Arts software, and pretty much the gold standard,  in  both  features  and  interface design, that all paint software on the Amiga and even other platforms would be judged by for a long time.

My first version was DPaint 3, which was  also  a  powerful  animation  creation  tool.  (I'll  save  animation  software  for  another  time,  however.) Deluxe Paint 4 added support for Amiga HAM color modes, along with tools common to those types of paint programs.  DPaint  4  AGA  supported  the then-new  AGA  chipset  A4000  and A1200 systems, with up to 256 color registers or the near-24 bit HAM8 color  modes.  Deluxe  Paint  5  came  out after the Commodore  bankruptcy, and  ambitiously  added  support  for painting 24 bit color images (displaying in Amiga color modes), along with brushes  and  textures  that  approximate natural media painting and other effects. Unfortunately, all the features added  on  from  the lean, mean DPaint 3 made the last version a  bloated  beast,  with  unacceptable performance even on a heavily accelerated system, and little support for add-on video cards.

The strongest, most direct competitor for  the  DPaint  crown  was  Brilliance (and  Brilliance  2,  which  lost  the  annoying copy protection joystick port dongle)  by  Digital  Creations,  going head-to-head with DPaint 4 AGA feature  for  feature,  and  even  copying most  keyboard  commands.  Perhaps one of its bigger performance advan-

tages  was  that  it  was  actually  two separate programs for differing purposes-the register-based Brilliance, which supported animation creation, and TrueBrilliance, which painted in a  24  bit  color  space  with  a  HAM  or HAM8 display, and could save in either form. The Deluxe Paint and Brilliance  series  were  both  so  evenly matched in their prime that it mostly came down to personal preference of interfaces or specific features or behaviors  for  which  one  to  use,  perhaps switching for specific projects.

While  it  didn't  stay  that  way,  paint programs that used the Amiga HAM (Hold and Modify) started largely as a domain all to themselves, because the  code  involved  in  making  and painting on a HAM display is a totally different  thing  than  a  register  display. The advantages to being able to use nearly every color an Amiga can possibly display (at the price of 'artifacts'  around  some  color  edges)  is the capability to display near photographic  quality  imagery,  and  create subtle color gradients and transparency  effects.  Digi-Paint,  created  by NewTek of later  Video  Toaster  and Lightwave 3D fame, was started as a companion  piece  to colorize  and touch  up  images  from  their  Digi View video digitizer, but it was easily possible to create images from scratch  as  well.  It  displayed  HAM painting power with an interface to set up gradient fills with transparency and 'highlights' as would appear on a rounded surface. Photon Paint 1 and  2  (barely  distinguishable  from each other) by Bazbosoft and Microillusions  was  not  quite  as  simple  to understand as Digi-Paint, but offered more direct control and versatility in its transparency and gradient effects, even applying them to image brushes. Spectracolor, published by Aegis/Oxxi, was basically Bazbosoft's Photon Paint 3, and offered the same power in a tweaked interface, along with new features, including image/brush warping and animation creation.

As  powerful  as  the  HAM-only  paint programs were, hardly any survived into  the  AGA  era,  presumably  because Amiga paint juggernaut Deluxe Paint  was  working  the  HAM  side  of the street too by this point, and making tough competition in a small market. I would love to have seen a HAM8 version of Spectracolor though.

In the later years of the Amiga, especially post-Commodore, add-on video cards  were  more  commonly  used, which  could  display  higher  resolutions  and  color  depths  than  the  native Amiga graphic chips. Sadly, this was a bit of a brick wall to many venerable  Amiga  paint  programs  mentioned above, as most relied heavily on the Amiga chips, either coded to access them directly or using Amiga specific display properties a third party video card can't handle, such as the aforementioned  HAM  color  modes, or copper display tricks that change palette  colors  or  even  resolutions mid-display for the purpose of an onscreen  toolbox  or  color  palette.  A new set of graphics programs would be  needed  for  this  era,  but  not  as many would step up this late in the Amiga's life span.

In 24 bit, there was also a lot of crossover between paint software and 'im- age  processing'  software,  with  each offering enough features of the other to blur the border between them. Personal  Paint  by  Cloanto  is  a  registerbased Deluxe Paint clone, though not necessarily  as  fully  featured  as  its spiritual  predecessor.  It  gets  along well  with  retargetable  graphics  and video cards, enabling Amiga or card screen  modes  up  to  256  colors.  It's even still being developed today, with versions for Amiga OS4 and MorphOS planned. TV Paint was a (relatively) longtime player in painting on a 24-bit 'true-color' display, with versions to address specific 24-bit framebuffer cards even before RTG driver systems like CyberGrafX and Picasso96 came into use. It was similar in style to Deluxe Paint, with growing paint features over time. TVPaint moved on to become a strong piece of animation  production  software  for Windows and other systems.

One I have come to use a lot is Photogenics, written by Paul Nolan, a more paint-centric  paint  and  image  processing combo program. Its claim to fame is that it uses paint layers, similar in concept to layers in Adobe Photoshop,  and  is  quite  versatile.  Paint can be put down on a layer with any number of tools and brushes, including  ones  that  emulate  natural  drawing  and  painting  media.  From  there, the layer can be modified or changed, even changing the marks laid down from  color  to  compositing  to  an  image  processing  effect,  until  you  are satisfied and 'fix' the layer to the image  semi-permanently.  While  Photogenics  is  Amiga  software  (though later  versions  were  made  for  Win-

dows and Linux), it was demanding enough that it ran rather poorly on a real  Amiga,  even  one  with  a  video card  and  68060  accelerator.  (Early versions  were  pretty  zippy,  but  version 5, the last Amiga version, was on the  edge  of  unusable.)  Photogenics found new life on PowerPC and emulated systems  capable of  running code faster than '060 speeds, making the program very usable and powerful on OS4 or MorphOS, even if it was written for a 68K-CPU Amiga.

FXPaint by IOSpirit was another paint program that works very much like Photogenics, and had direct PowerPC ports for better performance to boot. While similar, I found it had less of  the  quick  'pick  up  and  go'  artist aspect as Photogenics, though it might appeal more to those used to Photoshop.  Like  most  Amiga  software, neither FXPaint nor Photogenics  is  still  being  developed  for Amiga,  though  one  can  maybe  hope for  future  development  rights  to  go open  source  or  to  A-EON  like  with Personal Paint. Even at their age, they are  still  very  useful  programs  even today.

While I'm sure some of you out there know  of  more  paint  programs  I  neglected to mention. I stuck with software I used personally at one time or another.  Stay  tuned  in  the  coming months for my experiences in other graphic endeavors, such as animation or 3D rendering.
