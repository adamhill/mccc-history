## The Killer App

There's not a ton of news in the Amiga sphere, but there are a few tidbits. A  new  'Silver3'  core  has  been  released for the Vampire 600 V2 expansion, with updates to the CPU capabilities, SAGA 24-bit video modes, and more. I'm still waiting for a reply to my request for a Vampire board of my own, though according to  recent  board  chatter  it  appears there  may  be  a  wait  of  up  to  two months before as much as a reply is sent,  as  Kipper,  who  produces  the boards and handles orders, is dealing with order requests in the order they were  received.  I  think  I  still  have some time from my first request to go, so wish me luck.

Here is a new Amiga article link: http://www.atlasobscura.com/articl es/how-the-commodore-amiga-poweredyour-cable-system-in-the-90s

It's a little history of the Prevue cable guide channel, which showed rolling TV  schedule  info  in  the  days  before every  digital  TV  box  had  their  own guides, and was run with Amiga computer systems. It's worth a look if you enjoy a little nostalgia and history lesson.

The next AmiWest gathering in Sacramento has been set for October 8th and 9th this year. Drop by Amiwest.net for  further  information. A company named Retro 7-bit is selling  a  USB  keyboard  adapter  specifically  for  the  Commodore  CDTV,  in what may be one of the most obscurely  specific  hardware  releases  I've seen in a long time.(with the possible exception of a high-spec CPU expan-

sion for an Amiga 600, but that's neither here nor there.).

Over the history of computers there is  the  recurring  idea  of  the  'Killer App'-the software that creates enough demand to sell the hardware required  to  run  it.  Spreadsheet  and word processing software helped sell early  computers  to  business,  since they  offered  the  ability  to  change  a document  with  requiring  White-out. Big arcade ports like Space Invaders kicked  sales  of  the  Atari  2600  VCS into  high  gear.  Desktop  publishing software (and the desktop publishing concept itself) helped save the Apple Macintosh from the unprofitable market of early adopters and tech snobs. While the Amiga may not have reached  the  heights  of  some  other platforms, there are a few items that fall under Amiga 'Killer App' territory. One thing that sold Amiga systems, especially A500s in the United Kingdom  and  Europe,  was  games.  Perhaps the earliest example, predating the A500 even, was 'Defender of the Crown' by Cinemaware. It was also a pioneering example of a game (or 'interactive movie' as Cinemaware liked to term it) that gave graphical style  and  flash  far  greater  priority than the complexity or quality of the game itself, much as games today are frequently accused of doing. Ironically, while versions of the game for other  systems couldn't match the color palette, most offered a better overall gameplay experience than the rushed  Amiga  original.  Another  example  is  Psygnosis'  'Shadow  of  the Beast,'  a  shallow,  stupidly  difficult, frequently  unfair,  yet  utterly  beautiful game to look at, and a standout in a  time  when  most  Amiga  games looked  identical  to  their  Atari  ST

counterparts. As the games sold the Amigas, the easy-to-program Amigas spawned more game creators, who created  more  in-demand  games  to sell more Amigas. Those early visual feast games showed off the possibilities and got the ball rolling.

While productivity and creative software never moved the same units as the  games  did,  they  still  did  their part,  especially  for  the  larger,  higher-powered  machines.  The  'Deluxe Paint'  series,  created  by  Dan  Silva and Electronic Arts, is probably the biggest success of the earlier Amiga days.  While  hardly  the  first  paint software on the Amiga or other platforms, DPaint set many of the paradigms for ease of use in that period, along with simple paint, brush, and psuedo-3D effects. Version 3 brought those tools to animation creation as well. Even in today's photopaint world, there are still apps that ape the DPaint paradigm, especially useful  for  those  who  wish  to  work their graphics on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

The greatest killer app of the Amiga's later  life  (and  its  high  end)  would have to be NewTek's 'Video Toaster,' the hardware/software bundle that made  it  possible  to  do  with  a  few thousand dollars worth of computer and  video  equipment  things  that would have required tens if not hundreds of thousands in equipment before, and essentially created the 'desktop video' field like the Mac pioneered  desktop  publishing.  Amigas with Video Toasters all but dominated from the amateur to medium-professional video production field, and an  industry  of  extra  support  hardware and software around it. Amigas

and Toasters were mainstays of video studios and public cable channels for  much of the 1990s, which sadly didn't keep Commodore out of bankruptcy in 1994. Toaster systems kept chugging on for years to come, and it wasn't until the rise of HD and nonlinear-edited  digital  video  that  the Toasters started to fall out of favor. In theory,  a  higher  profile  for  modern Amiga systems like OS4, MorphOS, or AROS  is  just  one  killer  app  away. We're probably not going to see that anytime soon though, as long as most are  concentrating  on  small  utility apps or basic Linux ports. Good luck to you all.

## An Arcade Cabinet From IKEA Parts

Building  an  awesome  arcade  cabinet is something we've shown you how to do before, several times, but this  one  is  made  (mostly)  from IKEA components that are easy to buy, easy to mod, and designed to fit just about any game system, old or new.

If  you're  interested  in  it,  here's what you'll need, according to SIN Tchan,  an  IKEA  Hackers  reader  in Paris who built this himself:

- MICKE desk $49.99
- Samsung monitor 24' hdmi with speakers $150
- Arcade  stick  motherboard  $30 (type 'arcade stick pcb' on amazon.com)
- Buttons  +  joystick  (brand  Sanwa) $40
- Stainless steel panel $30
- Black stickers $15
- Stool $50
- An  Xbox,  Playstation  or  other console

you have an old console lying around you'd like to get a little more life out of,  this  might  be  a  great  use  for  itand the games you have sitting around  collecting  dust.  Once  you have  all  of  your  components,  it's largely  about  putting  everything  in the right place. Here is the full stepby-step:

This is a very geek creation: a real but light arcade cabinet. the console and the  button  wires  are  hidden  inside the desk drawer.

All in all, he spent $365 on the whole thing, and that assumes you need to buy everything above. Of course, you'll also need a console you want to  use  with  the  setup,  which  SIN Tchan left out of the price breakdown, but are obviously pretty important. If

1. Drill  the  holes  on  the  stainless steel for the buttons and the stick.
2. Drill  2  rectangles  on  the  work surface  to  be  able  to  insert  the stick and the button.
3. Put the black sticker on the stainless steel panel. Use a lighter directly on the sticker to evacuate the air bubbles if needed.
4. Connect  each  button  and  the stick  to  the  PCB  (it's  very  easytutorial on youtube)
5. Screw the stainless steel panel to the top of the work surface.
6. Screw the two screen holders in metal on the work surface (at 6 cm from the back of the desk).
7. Install  your  console  inside  the IKEA drawer (for a better airflow, you can also drill some holes on the back/side of the drawer)
