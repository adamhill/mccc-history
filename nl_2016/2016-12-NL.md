## Amiga News

Seems we have what some call a scandal of sorts. No I'm not talking the election stuff and I'm not going to. Hyperion started selling Kickstart and Workbench 3.1 digital images. In response Cloanto has placed the 'Value Edition of AmigaForever' up for sale on Groupees for the staggering price of $2.50. For those curious, you can find it at: https://groupees.com/remute15. It is an '.msi' file with a key. So it's for winblows. The ROMs included are supposedly 1.3 and 3.1. I got a copy but I don't know if running it will mess the copy of AmigaForever I have already. I was thinking at first this was just  the  1.3  and  3.1  Kickstarts-nothing  else-but  it may be more. There was one user on Morphzone that confirmed it has 3.1. I seriously doubt we'll hear anything on this on Amiga.org just because of who owns that site.

There wasn't really any other news on Morphzone this month. However there is news to share. The 'Toronto

PET Users Group' (TPUG) is holding a show the weekend of December  3rd  to  the  4th.  Oddly  enough it's going to be held in Toronto. The show  is  'World  of  Commodore' and  features  ALL  things  Commodore.  They  will  have  vendors,  it sounds like, and a freebie table. You can  drop  things  off  at  it  and  pick stuff up that's been left. Should be interesting to say the least.

Seems there is a batch of Hungarian Amiga users that are putting out an online Amiga magazine.  'Amiga Mánia  #1"  will  be  available  for download shortly. They announced it  over  on  Amiga.org  and  will  be posting the download link soon.

Elbox  is  still  putting  things  out  it seems. A new version of the 'FastA-

TA  4000  controllers'  is  available for  all  you  A4k  users.  I  saw  a  controller  there  for  the  A1200  but  it looks like you need a Zorro IV busboard to use it and they want over $159  for  it  without  the  Zorro  IV busboard.

While  looking  about  I  found  that AmigaKit.com is also selling a 'Prisma  Megamix  Music  Card.'  It's  installed with either a Zorro II/III or a  Clockport.  I  can't  say  I  get  the reasoning  for  this  one,  but  that's just  me  I  suppose.  I  wouldn't  be able to use it since I have a Subway on  my  Clockport  already.  USB  is just nice to have on the A1200.

AmigaKit.com. It's a 4xEIDE'99 Buffered Interface (with Allegro CDFS). The  bigger surprise is it's  only $37.19  (+  shipping  of  course).  Depending on my financing I may look into getting one. I  suspect  that would  fix  many  of  the  issues  I've been  having…not  to  mention  having  support  for  hard  drives  over 127GB. Of course this would show right before Thanksgiving and Christmahanakwanzika when I have  folks  needing  paying,  gifts, and feeding. We'll see how it goes I guess.

Those knowing my hunt for a new IDE  controller  will  be  shocked  I found one back in stock at
