## 2-Dimensional Animation Software

News has been light lately, with the release  of  a  new  software  development kit for MorphOS, and the unfortunate loss of Oliver Wagner, programmer for several Amiga applications like AmIRC and the Voyager web browser.

In  the  continuing  saga  of  Vampire Quest, AKA my attempt to get a Vampire II board for my Amiga 600, there is  something which could debatably be  called  a  development.  Over  the last week or so, I received a test 'do not respond' email that went out to Kipper2K's  entire  Vampire  mailing list, and about a day ago I got a mail from  Apollo  Accelerators  pointing me to a web form to get my info. I'm no closer to getting a Vampire board, but  at  least  I  have  reasonable  confidence  someone  in  charge  of  them knows I exist now.

In  my  continuing  series  of  'Amiga stuff I remember,' I move on to twodimensional  animation  software.  As the Amiga hardware had a strong advantage  over  other  systems  of  the time in shifting graphic data around, its  abilities  for  creating  animation and  displaying  it  in  real-time  were hard to match in its heyday.

Amiga animation software (and more) generally uses a process called 'double-buffering' to create a smoothly updating display. As the name implies, the system keeps two copies of the  screen  display  in  CHIP  memory

(or  video  memory  for  a  dedicated graphic card). While one copy is displayed on screen, changes are made to the copy not shown. When the updates  are  complete,  the  display  is pointed to the updated version, and old and new changes can be applied to  the  image  that  was  swapped  out. This lets display  changes  happen away from your eyes, in sync with the refresh  rate  of  the  monitor,  so  you won't  see  an  incomplete  update  onscreen. If  you  remember  moving graphics  on  old  computer  games  or animation, especially on older PCs or Macs, where the edges of objects appear to 'tear' or shift apart, you'll see what a  non-double-buffered  display not  updating in  sync  with  the  monitor looks like.

In the world of Amiga animation software, there are two main categories'page-flippers' and 'other.' Page-flippers  work  much  like  traditional  paper flipbooks, in that every frame of an  animation  is  a  complete  image, which are flipped through to create the illusion of motion. The IFF ANIM file standard is built on this, though it only stores the pixel data that changes from frame to frame to minimize the file size and memory usage compared  to  an  equal  number  of  full frame images. ANIM is the only widely-adopted Amiga animation file standard  that  can  be  loaded  or  played across several different applications, but  unfortunately  it  has  limits.  It  is designed only for playing frames in a set  sequence,  and  doesn't  include sound effects or extra effects. That's why  several  programs  may  save  in 'enhanced' versions of the format, or completely new ones, to support the features they require. Some programs may bypass the page-flipping

paradigm  completely,  building  animated  displays  in  different  ways. These fall  into  the  'other'  category, each one doing its own thing and not necessarily compatible with anything  else.  Pretty  much  any  animation  software  that  goes  beyond  the ANIM file standard includes a freely-distributable player program, enabling animation artists to show off and  distribute  their  work  without including a copy of the creation software along with it.

In the 'page-flip' category is the first piece of Amiga animation software I ever  used:  'Photon  Cel  Animator.' Unfortunately, it was a terrible choice for a first program, as it was geared more to a professional use on Amigas with lots of memory than an A500 with one meg. The reason for this was, while it could load and save ANIM files, every frame was held as uncompressed full frames in memory. This made for good performance, but the amount of frames in an animation was directly proportional to your total RAM, which was a big deal in a time when most Amigas topped out at 8 megabytes. Photon also had only a very basic interface and minimal  painting  tools,  but  it  did  have one feature that I found very useful later on. You could load a sound file into  the  program,  which  would  be played  back  in  small  'chunks'  that corresponded  to  a  specific  frame. This  made  Photon  Cel  Animator  an invaluable  tool  for  reading  audio tracks for lip-syncing and similar uses,  and  I  still  occasionally  use  the antiquated program for this purpose, even if I never got a lot out of it as visual animation software.

Later, I would get a more useful animation (&amp; paint) program, which is probably  the  best  known  and  most well-received and copied of its type-DeluxePaint III. Covered in my paint software roundup, the DeluxePaint series took on animation abilities with its third version, and introduced  features  that  would  become  common  in  the  genre.  Along with its powerful paint features and standard  page  flipping,  DPaint  III brought  out  'animbrushes,'  image clips  across  multiple  frames,  which could  be  painted  across  frames  to make an animated moving object. If that  wasn't  enough,  you  could  plug numbers  into  a  'move  requester,' and  have  the  brush  automatically rendered moving in perspective for a pseudo-3D animation. Later versions of DPaint added more screen modes and effects, but little could improve on the third version. The DeluxePaint series on the Amiga and PC lived well beyond  its  official  market  life,  as  it remained  a  popular  tool  for  retro 'pixel  art'  and  animation  for  hobby work  and  games  for  consoles  and phone/tablet  apps.  Even  the  music video  for  'Move  Your  Feet'  by  the group Junior Senior in 2011 was animated  entirely on  Amiga  DeluxePaint,  in  an  apparently  retro  pixel style yet still an impressive project.

There  were  a  number  of  other  'animation paint' programs for the Amiga  that  appear  cast  from  the  same mold  as  Deluxe  Paint,  either  in  feature  set  or  interface  design,  if  not both.  Brilliance,  also  mentioned  in the  paint  roundup  article,  was  the one  that  tried  hardest  to  beat  the DPaint  series  at  its  own  game  and match  it  feature  for  feature,  with some  differences.  As  the  two  programs were relatively equally matched, especially in the animation department, it came down mostly to personal preference for a particular feature or interface for which one to use.

A  more  specialized  animation  package  was  the  'Disney  Animation  Stu- dio.' Originally started as an in-house  tool  for  making  animation for Amiga games and software, it was expanded  into  a  full  software  package and one of the only pieces of genuine productivity software under the Disney  banner.  It  was  divided  into two main programs, 'pencil test' and 'ink and paint.'  'Pencil Test' looked like a cut-down Deluxe Paint that only worked in B&amp;W line art, but had an 'onion skin'  feature  that  showed  up to  three  previous  frames  faded  out under  the  one  you're  working  on, creating  a  similar  effect  to  tracing paper or a light box, and extremely useful for drawing animation. Other software  would  incorporate  similar features  later  on,  but  none  quite matched the simplicity or ease of use of  Pencil  Test.  The  other half of the package was 'Ink and Paint.' which was a simple program intended for coloring the line work created in pencil test-useful, but you could get better  results  bringing  the  animation over to a more full-featured program like  DeluxePaint.  By  doing  that  you couldn't take advantage of the third bit  of  the  Disney  Animation  Studio package, called the 'exposure sheet.' This was a basic list that let you order your created animation frames however you wish, and even add sound effects.  To  take  advantage  of  the sounds and random-access frame ordering, you have to use the proprietary  'CFAST'  file  format  instead  of the  ANIM  standard,  which  wasn't very efficient or popular. Finally, the package included several sample animations from Disney films that you could  study  and  tinker  with,  including  a  short  Donald  Duck  cartoon made to go with the software.

One more DPaint-like program, also noted in my previous roundup, is the Personal Paint series. While it is not as  strong  in  animation  features  as DPaint  or  Brilliance,  it  has  some more modern additions like good AREXX  script  integration  and  support for extra video card screens and resolutions.  It  also  has  a  handy  'storyboard' feature, which lets you view all your animation frames as thumbnails, and cut and paste them around as you see fit, as well as move around your color palettes and timing from frame to frame. Some programs work  in  the page-flipping  department, but stick more to an editorial role.

'Animation  Station'  by  Progressive Peripherals worked much like a prototype for the storyboard from PPaint, enabling you to build an animation, cut, copy, and  paste  the frames around, modify the timing or colors, and even add sound effects to frames.  While  the  ANIM  file  format did not support audio, the sound files could be included with a script and play with your animation if you used the package's player program. Later, the same company brought out ANIM Workshop, which covered much of the same ground in a different  way,  working  as  a  companion piece  to  an  image  processing  program  like  ADPro  or  ImageFX,  for batch-processing or pre-forming image processing operations across whole  animations.  Like  Animation Station, it enabled you to add sound effects to animations, but  ANIM Workshop could save ANIM files with sound effects into a single file, which could be shared using the freely-distributable player.

'Take-2'  by  Rombo  was  a  program designed primarily as a means to pencil test (no direct relation to the Disney program) animation frames created on paper and scanned/digitized, or from other sources.  Working  like  an  animation exposure sheet (also similar but different to Disney) you can place your loaded frames in any order, and even layer them over each other like traditional animation cels. From the sheet listing,  the  animation  can  be  previewed  in  a  rough  form,  and  then saved out as a final. Take-2 is less a 'pick-up-and-go' animation program, and  more  a  semi-professional  tool for  those  with  knowledge  of  traditional animation techniques.

The  'other'  category  of  animation software covers a variety of methods not covered by general pageflipping animation, and much could fall under the categories of multimedia or presentation  software.  One  of  the  first well-known  Amiga  animation  packages of any kind was Aegis Animator, which came out in 1985 and was later ported to the Atari ST. Instead of working frame to frame like a pageflipping  program,  Aegis  Animator moved  images  and  brushes  around the  screen,  along  with  basic  polygonal  shapes  from  one  'keyframe'  to another, with the in-between motion filled  in  as  the  animation  is  played back.

Fantavision,  from  Broderbund  software, took the same idea, expanding and  streamlining  the  process  somewhat,  especially  in  the  polygon  animation  department,  making  simple animation  and  'morphing'  projects relatively easy to accomplish.

A program I got a lot of use out of, and is largely responsible for my fame in the Amiga community, was Moviesetter by Gold Disk. Moviesetter did not do polygon morphing like the others, but  worked by displaying animated 'sets' (much like DPaint's animbrushes)  atop  background  images,  and plotting their movement either frame by frame or by motion paths. You  also  have  control  over  background scrolling, color palette changes, and sound effects at your choice of pitch, volume, and stereo channel. Unfortunately, it could only work in a  low-resolution screen mode in 32 colors or less, but there was still a lot

## The Amiga Graphics Archive

Not sure how long this site has been up  yet  as  I'm  just  getting  to  look  it over. A fun little site @ http://amiga.lychesis.net/ Memories, explanations and pretty pictures.  This  is  the  Amiga  Graphics Archive.  Almost  sounds  like  a  Twilight Zone intro huh? What it is however,  is  a  nice  look  back  on  part  of what,  in  my  opinion,  helped  make the  Amiga  great.  This  is  an  online collection of artwork from the older days of the Amiga when it was 16-bit. This  site  is  really  well  written  and shows  off  a  lot.  The  first  trick  I  noticed was the page shows a pixel (px) count across in the upper right menu bar corner. If you resize your browser screen it changes to reflect that. In addition  to  just  a  collection  of  pics you can see a comparison of the Atari vs the Amiga. They display the flicker of interlace screens and if you hover the pointer over the images it shows you a color palette. There is even an explanation  of  the  old  EHB  (extra half-bright) mode as well as showing off some of the animations folks did. Not just color cycling as the PC was doing back then, but animation. The site is also great for a trip down memory lane.

that could be done. Since Moviesetter, Fantavision, and Aegis Animator worked in a  method  where  the  animation was stored as a set of graphics and motion data instead of animation frames to be flipped through,  they  were  not  compatible with the ANIM file standard (or each other) and required their own player programs to enable creators to show off their work. On the upside, it was easy to use these programs to create long, non-repeating animations that didn't  require  a  lot  of  memory  or disk  space  compared  to  an  equivalent ANIM.  For example, I have created  Moviesetter  animations  that  ran for minutes , loading from two floppy discs to an Amiga system with 2 to 4 megs of RAM. A similar ANIM would require  far  more  memory  and  storage.

In  many ways, these animation programs are the spiritual ancestors of stuff like Shockwave Flash, for better or  worse.  I  miss  the  days  of  Amiga animation software. There's little out there in modern animation software that works for the pick-up-and mess-around hobbyist anymore-at least not on the desktop. You might find  something  worth  playing  with on the phones and tablets, however.
