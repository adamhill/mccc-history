Spring  is  back  and  our  podcast  too, with  a  fine  selection  of  the  musical productions  of  The  Gathering  2015 Freestyle compo

Here  is  the  tracklist  of  this  podcast (And also my review of these tracks in the playlist-Doctor Clu):

- Jingle by JGG - AmigaVibes (0'26)
- Crown - Microkid (3'17) (0:27)  A  rock  track  much  like  a alternative rock track. *****
- Walking on Air - Ask Lars (3'13) (3:45) Female vocal track, a bit of dance pop. *****
- Danger - Imbold (3'25) (7:03) More hard synth, base drops. ***
- Ready - Marlind97 (3'02) (10:30)  A  quippy  keyboard  piece. Owl City-like. ****
- Torch - Kime (0'30) (13:20) A jazzy piece that would be good to drive to. Too short. ****
- Endless  Summer  -  DJ  eXeCute (2'36) (13:48)  Dance  mix  piece  w/the
- rhythm on what I call circus music.-
- Cook It - Deserter (3'18) (16:30) Synth orchestra/organ with a beat. ****

(24:43)  Starts deceptively  slow, gains steam like a train. ****

- Hangover - nico\_e (3'13) (27:38) Whoa!! Rave/dance music. ***
- Poro - fjomje (3'02) (30:48) Songs sounds like Inspector Gadget turned on it's head.  **
- Overworld  Overture  -  Lufteluke (2'17) (33:46) Almost 8 bit sounding, almost Tetris like.  **
- DrumnStep - Glexes (2'04) (36:00) Quick pace that would be perfecting for bobsledding.  ***
- Dance With Me - Rootkit (0'15) (38:02) What little we get of this is repetitious. *

## Ratings:

- -Oh wow that was bad.
* Well, they tried.
- ** Creative at least. *** Some good, mostly enjoyable. **** Really liked that.  Would love to hear that from time to time.
- ***** Amazing, that is going in my regular listening selection.

Note:  I  am  not  a  fan  of  chiptunes, worbly effects, and repetition.  Those usually score low. I am a fan of rock, new  age  music,  dance  tracks,  and about anything done well.

## WHDLoad (And More)

In the 'Amiga stuff' world, a new 'Silver  5'  core  for  the  Vampire  V2  for the Amiga 600 was released earlier this  month,  boasting  bug  fixes,  minor speed increases, programmable screen resolutions for the SAGA video modes, and improved support for the  internal  SD  card  and  large  IDE drive  partitions.  I'm  still  sitting  on the  interminable  wait  list  for  my own Vampire board, hoping I haven't  just  been  forgotten  instead. With luck I'll yet have the opportunity for a stupidly powerful Amiga 600. (So wish me luck-I could use some)

Apparently, there is a website called 'AlternativeTo.net,' which lets users check for alternate possibilities to a particular piece of software (such as 'Microsoft Office' or whatever). The site can also list available options for Amiga,  MorphOS,  or  AROS  as  well, assuming options exist and someone has  listed  them  to  the  site.  Given time and cooperation, it could be a valuable  resource  to  Amiga  family users, as well as others.

In the short form news, a new port of Duke  Nukem  3D  for  68060  Amiga systems is released. Also, a new Hollywood  plugin  called  'RapaGUI'  is available, which is a tool kit for creating user interfaces that work across platforms, be they Amiga MUI, Windows, Linux GTK, or Mac. Seems like an impressive and potentially useful tool.

A  common  use  for  Amiga  systems today, whether real hardware or emulated,  is  'retro  gaming'-playing the vast library of Amiga games from over its history. The issue with a lot of computer gaming, not only Amiga, is different games may be written to

For  convenience  in  Amiga  gaming, WHDLoad  is  a  pretty  indispensable package. Originally it was shareware, displaying  a  registration  reminder before  a  game  started,  but  it  has since  gone  freely  available.  WHDLoad's  intent  is  for  you  to  use  the package to install games you already own  in  their  original  form  to  your hard drive, but 'pre-installed' WHD- specific  Amiga  models  or configurations, and may not work so well  on  others,  especially ones with newer or upgraded hardware or CPU. With  Amiga  games,  where many  are  written  to  'bang the metal'  (programming the  hardware  directly  and tossing  out  the  operating system for maximum performance),  this  is  a  frequent issue,  and  makes  it  somewhere between inconvenient and impossible to play the widest variety of Amiga games  on  a  single  systemor  at  least  that  used  to  be the case. Coming to the rescue was a software package called WHDLoad, which made it much easier to take your old floppy disk games and install them to the hard drive on your newer  expanded, accelerated, (or emulated)  Amiga  hardware.  It also  added  the  option  to load  the  games  from,  and quit back to the Workbench, as opposed to the usual business  of  booting  from  the game disk,  and  requiring  a reboot or power off to quit.

Load  distributions  of  many  Amiga games  can  be  found  on  the  web  to save  you  that  trouble.  Remember that  no  one  condones  downloading WHDLoad game distros you don't already own (except large sections of the  Internet  population),  so  remember  to  stay  legal.  Depending  on  the specific  game,  some  will  require  a switch  to  PAL  or  NTSC  or  non-AGA

video modes, or to have an older  Kickstart  ROM  image file  available  (usually  1.3). Most  games  I  have  played on  my  A4000T/060  work quite  well,  though  certain games may have minor problems based on the quality of their 'loader,' such as video  display  issues,  small bugs  (possibly  ones  in  the game itself), or running faster than normal on accelerated systems. Regardless, WHDLoad  is  an  invaluable tool for anyone who wishes to do gaming on more than a  very  basic  Amiga  system, or  easily  load  their  games from  the  Workbench  or  a central GUI hub program. If you enjoy  Amiga  gaming (and convenience), you should probably check it out if you don't have it already.
