## News, And A Look  at Atari/Amiga History

It's a new month, a new time, a new whatever. There have been a few bits of  news  here  and  there  at  least.  A new website is out there: AskAmiga.com. It lets people ask Amiga-related questions and (hopefully) get expert answers to their hardware and  software  problems,  potentially becoming a central resource for Amiga and related information.

A  new  article  on  Amiga  history  was published  on  the  Ars  Technica  site, with focus on Newtek's Video Toaster and its place in the history of video production.

A  new  'Chrysalis'  software  compilation for MorphOS 3.9 is now available. Like previous versions, it is intended to  install  over  a  'clean'  Morph  3.9 installation,  and  offers  a  full  set  of software and utilities, similar to a Linux distro.

A new game with the curious title of 'Tanks Furry' (apparently the furries are  driving  the  tanks)  was  released for  classic  Amiga  systems,  and  is available  on  CD  and  floppy  disk.  It seems rather 'retro' in style, which is probably  foolish  to  say  for  a  game that runs on an A500.

A special hardware development which has been getting a lot of attention lately is the 'Vampire II' board for the Amiga 600. Like earlier Vampire boards and drawing inspiration from  Minimig  and  Natami  projects, the Vampire II is an FPGA-based card that  clips  over  the  CPU  of  the  A600 and currently offers 128 megabytes of  RAM,  HDMI  video  output,  and  a CPU  performance  that  strongly  exceeds that of the 68060. New 'cores' are in the works that reprogram the FPGA chip and add support for a micro-SD card as a solid state drive, Picasso-96  compatible  16  and  24  bit video modes, AGA chipset emulation, and more features yet to come. Boards for Amiga 500 and other models  are  planned  for  the  future.  I'm definitely interested in trying to procure one of these myself, as I have an under-utilized Amiga 600, and it would  be  tempting  (and  fun)  to  update it into the most powerful Amiga system I've ever seen, possibly even supplanting  my  workhorse  A4000T, all in a small A600 package. If you can get one, the A600 Vampire II is 150 Euros. For information, visit http://kipper2k.com/accel600.html .

Most Amiga fans are probably aware of Atari's role in the formative years of  their  favorite  system.  Jay  Miner was a former Atari employee with a hand  in  designing  the  video  hardware of the Atari 2600 game console and  the  400/800  computers,  and Atari loaned the fledgling Amiga company development capital, which would later be used as leverage in an attempt to acquire the Amiga technology before they were 'saved' by Commodore.  Considering  the  hardware designers  and  management  moving around between companies, the Ami-

ga was more a spiritual successor to the  Atari  8  bit  computers,  while Atari's own ST series was more like a successor  to  the  Commodore  64. What I find pretty fascinating is how, as a founding video game company, Atari  has  been  related,  directly  or indirectly,  to  so  many  other  game and computer producers over time.

Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak passed through Atari in the 70s,  with  the  supposed  story  that Jobs got Wozniak to do his work for him, cheating him out of most of the bonus  money  for  simplifying  the hardware of  the  'Breakout'  arcade machine. The two Steves supposedly borrowed  parts  from  Atari  to  produce the Apple 1, and offered up the Apple II for Atari to sell, which met with  little  interest  at  the  time.  A group  of  Atari  software  programmers, fed up with getting no credit for their work, split off to form Activision,  practically  creating  the  thirdparty software  company  concept and influencing  how  hardware  and software  companies  interact  with each  other  from  then  on.  Nintendo approached Atari in the early eighties with the prospect of distributing their Famicom system outside of Japan. Early arrangements were made, but fell through thanks to conflicting priorities and Atari putting theirs to its 7800 system, leaving Nintendo to go  it  on  their  own  to  become  the most successful game system of its time.  With  history  trying  to  repeat itself, Sega approached Atari, hoping their  clout  and  distribution  would help their Mega Drive console in the US after the (relative) failure of the Sega Master System. That deal also fell  through,  in  part  because  Sega preferred to hold on to the European market  themselves, but Sega did poach a few employees from Atari, as well as the console name 'Genesis' to avoid a trademark conflict with the Mega Drive name in the US (although 'Tomahawk' was also kicked around for  a  bit),  and  went  on  to  success. Finally,  in  a  bit  of  Amiga  full-circle, former  Amiga  hardware  engineers worked with game company Epyx to produce a hand-held color game system  known  as  the  Handy  in-house. Epyx lacked the money and network to release the system on its own, so they  went  to  Nintendo,  who  were ready to release their own GameBoy (graphically  inferior  in  B&amp;W,  but much  longer  battery  life  and  play time for it),  and  turned  them  down. Sega  passed  as  well,  but  allegedly tried  to  copy  their  hardware,  even having the balls to ask engineer Dave Needle  for  help  when  they  failed. Much to the Amiga peoples' chagrin, the Handy ended up with Atari, and became  the  Lynx.  Then  again  Atari wasn't too pleased either with needing to use Amigas for Lynx software development,  so  that's  one  more 'last laugh' for Amiga over Atari.

## Samsung's 15TB SSD

Samsung  has  announced  that  it  is now shipping its PM1633a SSD. That's a boringly mundane name for a drive that's anything but: the PM1633a  isn't  just  the  biggest  SSD around,  it's  straight-up  the  biggest drive around. At 15.36TB, it dwarfs other SSDs and surpasses the capacity  even  of  the  very  latest  magnetic spinning disks. Remarkably, it packs all  this  storage  into  a  conventional 2.5-inch package.

The company explained how this was done in August last year. While traditional  integrated  circuits  (whether processors or flash memory or RAM or  anything  else)  have  a  flat,  essentially  2D  structure,  this  drive  uses Samsung's  3D  V-NAND  technology, which  vertically  stacks  48  layers  of NAND  cells  to  greatly  increase  the storage  density.  The  highest  performance flash memory stores a single bit in each flash cell;  Samsung's trades a bit of performance for density,  storing  three  bits  per  cell.  Each die using this technology stores 256Gb (32GB) of data.

The company then adds a second level  of  layering:  16  of  the  256Gb  dies themselves are stacked up, creating a package  with  a  512GB  capacity.  Of these  packages,  32  are  used  in  the PM1633a to give it its total 15.36TB capacity.  Samsung  plans  future  versions  with  7.68TB,  3.84TB,  1.92TB,

960GB,  and  480GB  capacities.  The 15.36TB unit also has 16GB of RAM embedded.

The PM1633a is aimed at enterprise markets, and accordingly it will use an enterprise interface: 12Gb/s Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). The raw performance of this  drive  won't  match the very fastest PCIe-attached drives, with  Samsung  saying  it  offers  read and write speeds of 1,200MB/s, with 200,000 read and 32,000 write operations  per  second.  However,  these numbers handily beat spinning disks, and  previously,  that  was  the  only way of offering this kind of capacity. As for endurance, Samsung says that the drive supports 15.36TB of writes per day over its five-year life cycle.

The South Korean firm is leaving one important detail out, at least for now: the price. As is typical for enterprise products, if you have to ask, you can't afford  it.  The  previous  generation PM1633 products cost around $1,000 (£700) per TB. We'd assume that the new drive will cut that per terabyte price, but we still wouldn't expect  to  see  much  change  from $8,000 (£5,600). Still, if it means having the biggest drive  ever  made, that's a small price to pay, isn't it?
