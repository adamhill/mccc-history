## The National Videogame Museum

Most of  us  who  own  Amigas  have, at one time or another, been interested in video games.  We've played them on our C64s, our Amigas and sometimes  on  various  other  consoles. Since that is the case, I thought I should point out that The National Videogame Museum is in located  in  our  Metroplex…  to  be specific: Frisco. From their website:

Our mission is fairly straightforward  and  simple:  To  preserve the  history  of  the  videogame industry by archiving not only the  physical  artifacts,  but  also the information and stories behind its creation.

ond  or  third  hand  renditions. Rescuing  the  physical  artifacts left behind can be difficult enough-making sense of passed-on stories can be next to impossible.

lion dollar business.' There are individual  GAMES  that  make that much today.

The goal of the National Videogame  Museum  is  to  document, FIRST HAND, as much information about the creation and evolution of the videogame industry  as  possible  and  preserve as many physical artifacts as  possible  for  generations  to come. The vast majority of the people who created the videogame industry had no idea how enormous it would become and therefore never really saw much importance in what they were  doing. The founder of Atari,  Nolan  Bushnell,  felt  he was  creating  something  huge and saw videogames as having the  potential  to  become  a  'bil-

Videogames have been around in one  form  or  another since the 1950s  and  many of the people who first decided to  combine  interactive entertainment with a graphical  display such as a monitor or  a  TV  set  have passed-away. In some  cases,  the stories these people had to tell are lost forever or only  live  on  in  sec-

Lastly,  we  will  present  the  information and as many of the physical artifacts as possible to the  public  in  an  entertaining and  informative  way.  Videogames  are  meant  to  be  played and that is the underlying thought behind each and every exhibit  in  the  museum.  This means  that  we  will  do  everything in our power to allow museum patrons the opportunity to actually PLAY as many games as possible during their visit to the National Videogame Museum.

The location is: 8004 North Dallas Parkway Frisco, TX 75034

## C64 Still Running Auto Shop in Poland

We  need  to  learn  a  lesson  about needless  consumerism  from  this auto repair shop in Gdansk, Poland. Because it still uses a Commodore 64  to  run  its  operations.  Yes,  the same  Commodore  64  released  34 years ago that clocked in at 1 MHz and  had  64  kilobytes  of  RAM.  It came  out  in  1982,  was  discontinued in 1994, but it's still used to run a freaking company in 2016. That's awesome.

To be sure, small businesses around the world often use technology that's a bit more outdated than what the rest of us use in our daily lives  but  damn,  flexing  a  Commodore  64  for  work  in  a  time  when babies  are  given  smartphones  before pacifiers is pretty damn bad ass.

Here's what Commodore USA's Facebook  page  wrote  regarding  the computer:

This C64C used by a small auto repair shop for balancing drive-
