		<h1>Jay Miner at MetCom 89</h1>
		<p>The MCCC held a series of events that we titled MetCom. Many, including MetCom 
		&#39;89, were produced with the cooperation of SCOPE, a Dallas user group. 
		For many of these events we had a featured speaker in addition to 
		special demonstrations and classes held in various meeting spaces. Most 
		were held, as was this one, at the Arlington Convention Center, 
		Arlington Texas. Arlington is well known as the home of the Dallas 
		Cowboys as well as the Texas Rangers baseball team and the original Six 
		Flags amusement park. </p>
		<p>For MetCom &#39;89 our featured speaker was Jay Miner. The video 
		below includes the entire talk and follow-up question and 
		answer session. The video was produced by Jack Detore who is seen 
		introducing Jay. Run time is just under 50 minutes.</p>
