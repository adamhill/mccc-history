## Newsroom Fix Author Unknown

(Reprinted from ICCC newsletter, Kennewick Washington, February, 1986)

If last meeting and saw saw my demonstration oi Newsroom the printout it disappointed. The printout is very "grainy" compared to printouts from Print Shop and other hires dumps.

When READST called' in the accumulator. The if the printer is there x register pl decremented in the Phe charadoor again, 1s supposed to print so instead of the character it prints blank because of the zero.

If you want to fix this then do so at own risk. sure your version actually has this bug in it, you keep CTRL-V pressed during the loading of Newsroom the version number will be displayed before the program completes loading; my version is 1.0).

Fortunately the bug Is easy to fix. We change the branch in the NP.0 branch back to $4503 instead of $4505. The accumulator is reloaded with the Print character which is stored at address

Second you are using single the character e a 50090l don't need the change. once anyway so you

Next type in this five-line program and save it to disk:

Make sure all your BASIC statements are correct. Insert your back-up of Newsroom into the drive and RUN this little program. If all went well the NP.O module should be fixed - it prints much nicer.
