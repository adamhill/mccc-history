The two most popular with is the INPUT statement and ameri GET statement. The results the person using program to feed information directly into the computer. The program Is then designed to act on that information. This information can be in the form of numeric data, or string data, or a combination of both. Suppose The SaNtAN the user to enter numeric data. be alpha character name. In otherwords also correct. If string data is the desirec input. by then the INPUTA INPUTRATE would the user followed by the string symbol (INPUTAS or INPUTRATES).

The one space to the right oi the question mark and the computer alts further executior until the correct response response is is entered Do If an incorrect entered numeric data when the user (i.e. the computer is looking res string outd, havestreen atmerien the response numeric) computer responds with ?REDO FROM START and prompts the user to re-enter data.

This message response can be up to 38 characters to 38 acheracteos iong.e can see the INPUI statement very powerful tool.

command by programmers statement. the INPUT statement as flexible and the GET statement as inflexible. Unlike the INPUT statement which allows multiple entries and 38 characters to be entered strine"Computer, the GET statement baess execution keypress by the user. These keypresses stored in the kevboard buffer and the continues the condition is That last statement may sound strange but I'11 attempt to explain happens.

Remember my article several months ago concerning DYNAMIC KEYBOARD technique? The keyboard buffer can store and act upon 10 keypresses. The GET statement maximizes this buffer. Because of theability to in the keyboard buffer the GEI statement is normally conjunction with the conditional IF statement to force the computer to look for specific data entries. Like the INPUT statement you can cause the computer for numeric or alpha characters (GETA or GETAȘ). It does not support program instructions so they are normally set with the PRINT statement immediately before the short program example to illustrate it's use:

10 REM YOUR PRG GOES HERE 100 PRINT"ENTER Y/N" 101 GETA$: IFAŞ&lt;&gt;"Y"THENEND 102 PRINT"YOUR PRG CONT'S HERE"

Usetul. bu. but not very pretty, right? The Ilexibility lies in the conditional statement. Let' s look at another example:

100 PRINT PRINT"ENTER SELECTION"

102 PRINTTAB (5)"2 - TEST2"

101 PRINTTAB (5)"1 - TEST1"

103 PRINTTAB (5)"3 - TEST3"

104 GETA: IFA="'"THEN104

105 IFA=1THEN200

106 IFA=2THEN300

107 IFA=3THEN400

108 IFA&lt;1ORA&gt;3THEN104

200 PRINT"THIS IS TEST1": GOT0104

300 PRINT"THIS IS TEST2": GOT0104

400 PRINT"THIS IS TEST3": GOT0104

The last was designed so could experiment a little. entering a numeric happens. Enter alpha ERROR. Because of this fault with the GET statement most programmer's specify the GET with the string character and then convert the string data back into numeric if the program requires it later.

In both program examples above the GE] statement searched for a , single keypress. redefining , your conditional statement you can have the computer wait for up characters as earlier stated. Here's example:

100 GETA$: IFA$=''''THEN100

101 IFAS="1234567890"THEN PRINTAS

102 GOTO100

Now add an conditional extra character in statement characters and run it again. No matter how Will contal only to be racters rinted outerhe third command to execution is the WAIT statement. Program statements we examined, computer halted the program and waited for enter data before continuing. statement executes if a specific attern exists, not for a specific pattern. there are three values inherent and defined by the WAIT statement mask, trigger). Address is the memory (address location be tested by WAIT, mask determines whether or only some, of the bits in address are tested, and trigger is the actual value that the progran halt. In other words, if the mask the trigger value, then halt program execution. It the mask value does not equal trigger continue execution. There are a couple of things you

need · know It you plan on using thi little used feature. he addres: you use a location whose change independently contents can program. Otherwise there will he no way resume program execution. Untortunately, this is biggest drawback with the command and that few programmers use this feature.

EX. 1 - WAIT 197,64, 64: POKE 198,0

lhis example waits for you to press a ey betore program execution continues.

EX. 2 - WAIT 2 - WAIT 197, 64: POKE 198,0

This example waits for you to take your hand off the keyboard

a certain position is not siness th just leave off the trigger default value is zero, omission of a trigger value causes the WAIT statement to execute a halt whenever all the unblocked bits are zero.

readily surmise, there properties associated three commands discussed today. command has a place in your toolbox recommend each of specific applications. Well, that's it for this month. Hope you presented experimentation imagination probably be writing some top-notch programs in no time at all.
