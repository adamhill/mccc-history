## PROGRAMMER'S CORNER

by Bob Lawson, Librarian, Night Chapter

As children, taught, in grade school, how to create cartoons by drawing picture on a sheet of paper, and, on subsepicture with a fight variation. When ne finished drawing several pages, were told to thumb these pages rapidly. Lo, and behold, appeared to Pictures this as they knowledge we acquired at a young age rudimentary still today, we have Commodore 64's to do most of the work for us.

All the rules we have discussed in the three previous articles also apply animation. to Let's to our computers and ive it a whirl. The first thing we want to 1o is clear the screen and set our border and background colors:

Sprite animation is simple process of storing flipping in memory and sprites and out to simulate You may be saying, to Yeus talk that this clown doesn't know what about. In this final article on sprites rites will attempt to show you just how easy it really is.

- 10 PRINTCHR$ (147) : POKE53281, 0:

POKE53280, 0

Tell the computer you will be working vith sprites and clear the sprite register in. Prevent any unwanted data from creeping

- 15 V=53248
- 20 POKEV+21,0

Now let's set our sprite color:

- 25 POKEV+39,1

We're now ready to define our sprite. In the following, example I'll define sprites which will be used to create the animation routine. Each sprite will have own data statements and will be stored in it's own memory location.

- 110 REM **SPRITE TWO
- 111 DATAO, 64,0, 4, 96, 112, 6, 112, 248, 7, 121,255,7,125,240, 7,255,224, 15,255

- 113 DATA0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0, 0

Now let's set our screen display location, establish the polnter for our irst sprite, and display it on the screen:

- 45 X=155:Y=130:P=192•
- 50 POKEV,X: POKEV+1, Y
- 60 POKEV+21,1
- 55 POKE2040, P

Go ahead and run nothing unique that it. So fats't we've done haven done in previous articles. But here's the tricky part that most people don't understand. We sprite cer have stored in memorot ali teter we have stored in memory. to your sprite chart which was in the first article in this series you'll see that 192 refers to sprite Pointer 193 refers to sprite one sprite two. IF and zero. pointer 194 refers to we use these pointers to flip our three sprites in and out in succession, rapid we can very effectively simulate animation. All it takes is one short command and a LOOP:

56 P=P+1:IFPM194THENP=192 65 GOT050

When the pointer exceeds the last sprite sequence, then the pointer to the beginning and starts over. The GOTO statement an endless Now run it again. Kind of stick, isn't it: One other thing you might want things down using a delay loop to get a kind of lazy effect:

## 53 POKE2040, P: FORT=1T060: NEXT

See there, I told you it was easy. If you want to get fancy, simply incorporate some of the techniques we articles you typed last program, probably had a hard

40 R=12608:FORS=0T062: READZ: POKER+S, Z: NEXT S 65 Y(6)=(6)-1:IFY (6) §90THEN67 67 7(6)=Y (6)+1: IFY (6)=133THEN70

Hope you've enjoyed this as I have enjoyed earlier in the restinete are it. As I stated still a lew things which can serieshe done but are not in BASIC. These include reversing, flipping. you can overcome shortfalls.

month we'll do some comparisons statement, the WAIT statement. Until next month, HAPPY PROGRAMMING.

## SPRITES ON THE 128 by Bob Dodson

Sprites are the 128. Unlike the ane the ancho realer to work with a the 128 has SPRDEF, HOVSER, COLLISION and actually on the 64 - it was simply too hard. Reference the work involved just didn't spark a fire of interest in me. The commands in the 128 until, needing send born federan are page, negumped

All I can say is "Come on in. The water's fine!"

Rather than more you a great engib ·alking about the commands very simple race car program that ha: sprites and Joystici with nrich Shri , sprites programmed in BASIC 7.0. All you to do is to design two sprites race car and a smashed race car - and then type in the short program. Okay. Let's get started.

Crank up your 128 in the 40 column mode and type SPRDEF (RETURN). This will bring the the bruct ins pritesing inter page. The instructions 117-118 of the 128 System Guide.
