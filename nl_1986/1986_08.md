However, enthusiasm began to wane when I started doing what the most, programmere's got to be an underneath me screen?. I as soon as I cleared the soon discovered that the RAM area which had been set aside to store the menu had been moved and replaced by other functions, among them a text editor and the ability to delete a range of lines when programming in BASIC.

too much joined the Arlington Chapter and discovered immediately the fruits of watched", fee software, and lots of it! "Y surprised to see that they didn't take much time to copy large numbers of disks for club utility, By ungrazing what they called program, the preparatory routines were bypassed by the periormed CLOSES, didn't have anything what was printed on the appeared immediately after rogram was loaded

'UTILITY WEDGE' made home computing a lot more exciting.
