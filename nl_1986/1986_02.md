## MCCC MEMBERS HONORED

Prominent MOOC members, Craig Smith and Aaron Hightower attended the January Quarterly Meeting touting their newly acquired awards for winning the ESC Region XI Computer Competition held earlier in the day. The contest was sponsored by the Texas Computer Education Association and involved 28 two-man teams from various high schools in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.

The teams were given 3 hours to complete 7 programming problems and were judged on technique as well as time. Craig and Aaron who are best known for writing the terminal and BBS programs now used on our club, finished the problems 45 minutes earlier than the team winning second place. Not only did they excell, they won the competition by a considerable margin.

The winning team will now proceed to the state finals in San Antonio,

February 8, where they will compete against winners in the 25 other districts.

Those of us who know Aaron and Craig are extremely proud of them and we all wish them the very best at the state finals.

## PROGRAMMER'S CORNER

by Bob Lawson, Librarian, Night Chapter

Over the years many methods have been used to call attention to individual achievements, ideas, information, and suggestions. In grade school children raise their hands to be recognized; businesses use marques and slogans to attract customers; publishing companies underline, capitalize, indent, or italicize phrazes to emphasize information; and the movie industry uses sound very effectively to emphasize and channel emotions. This is just a partial listing of thousands of techniques which are available. If you are programming, you will find that being able to channel the users' attention to specific information in your program is both useful and effective.

Probably the two most effective means of calling attention to your program is by using sound or flashers. Programming sound can be very difficult to achieve for the beginning programmer. So, for the sake of breyity and in order to progress to higher levels of programming on a gradual basis, I have elected to talk about flashers. Keep in mind that these

Cont'd on page

techniques are not the only one's available to us but time and space makes an in-depth discussion prohibitive.

There are three primary areas which are very conducive to flashing: border, background, and printed data. Let's begin our first flasher and discuss what's happening inside your computer:

100 REM *** YOUR PROG GOES HERE *** 997 PRINTCHR$ (147)CHR$ (13)CHR$(5) "THESE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS"

998 PRINT"PRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE" 999 GOSUB2000

1000 REM ** YOUR PROG CONTINUES ** 1999 STOP

2000 FORR=2T01STEP-1

2005 POKE53280, R

2015 NEXT

2020 GETA$: IFA$=K$THENRETURN

2025 GOTO2000

In line 999 the GOSUB command simply tells the conputer to stop executing the program in sequential order, jump to another location, and continue executing from the new location. Line 2000 starts a loop decrementing the variable R by the STEP number each time it passes through the loop. Line 2005 pokes the border color memory location with the data in variable R, again, updating the location with the new value each time through the loop. Line 2015 updates the variable R and causes the POKE statement to execute. This process continues until R is decremented to its' minimum value. The program then jumps out of the loop and moves to line 2020. Here, we find a logic matrix for the computer to act on. If the statement is true the computer jumps back to the next statement following your GOSUB command. If the statement is false it drops through to line 2025 where it finds instructions to start the loop sequence again.

If you have typed and run above routine you'll find that the border flashes quite effectively. But, it could definitely be improved. First of all, it's obvious that everything you've read about how slow the POKE statement is is not quite true. Let's slow things down a bit and see how it

2

looks.

2010 FORT=. 1TOISTEP. 005: NEXTT

All we've done here is insert another loop: in this case, a delay loop. Incidentally, a 1o0p which 15 inserted within another loop is called a nested loop. So, if you have seen this term used and wondered what it was, you have just created one. You'll nOw find a totally different but dramatic affect. If you are curious about what the background would lo0k like using this technique, substitute 53281 for 53280 in line 2005.

Changing colors of a print statement to create a flashing effect is not nearly as dramatic as what you've seen above. Consequently, I find it better to alternate the printed statement between normal print and reverse print. This procedure is a little more complimented. Let's change the routine from 2000 down:

2000 M$=" RETURN ": R=2: C=6: D=100: K$=CHR$ (13)

2005 POKE783, O: POKE781, R: POKE782, C

2010 SYS65520: PRINTCHR$ (18)M$

2015 FORZ=1TOD: NEXT

2020 POKE783, O: POKE781, R: POKE782, C

2025 SYS65520: PRINTM$

2030 GETAS: IFAS=KSTHENRETURN

2035 FORZ=1'TOD: NEXT

2040 GOTO2005

Rather than tell you what's happening in this routine, I'll give you some hints only and leave you with the task of modifying the routine to suit yourself. The variable R equals row location; variable C equals column location; and variable D equals time delay. Poke locations 781, 782, and 783 are storage locations not used unless a Datasette is your primary storage device. I am assuming your system includes a disk driye. At any rate, I have stored the data in these memory locations and the SYS65520 addresses these storage locations and executes accordingly.

proficient you'll become. Someone once to do what I wanted it to do, then the

Sorry, that's all the hints I'm giving you. Remember, programming is a learning experience. The more you experiment on own, the more told me that if I could get a program

program was right. If it uses more memory than you are satisfied with, then work on reducing your source code. If it operates slower than you wish, then find another way to make it faster. Finally, if Basic is not powerful enough for you, then learn machine language. Well, I can honestly say that my total knowledge of machine language plus 10 cents wouldn't buy me a cup of coffee.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there has never been anything cast in stone stating you can't try something else. The whole secret to programming successfully, regardless of your language of choice, is experimentation. Hope you enjoyed this month's installment. Next month is pot luck. So put those thinking caps on, experiment with your programs, and support our public domain library.

## COMPUTING

## AS I SEE IT By Jeffrey Bishop

Reprinted from the Catalina Commodore Computer Club, Tucson, AZ

The young man sits patiently in front of his new Commodore 128 awaiting the arrival of the synthetic voice to speak the contents of his invisible screen. Finally the voice echoes throughout the room saying, "syntax error. " A sigh of anxiety emits from his mouth.

As you can see, the frustrations of programming, even for me are just as nerve racking. Hello there, my name is Jeff, and I am here to tell you about some of my adventures as a lover of computers, and as an avid Commodore user. Let me start by giving you a bit of information about myself. I was first introduced to the fascinating world of computers back in 1982. A good friend sat down with me and helped me start programming a Texas Instrument 99/4a. I was amazed at the power of the machine, but at that time my knowlege of basic was very limited and I had a hard time even printing material to the screen. Well, ever

2452

since that time I had the urge to buy a computer. I did not get the chance to do so until the latter part of 1983. Atter returning home from working at Camp Victorio, a boy scout camp located up in the mountains, I had really started to look around for what would suit my needs the best. Sure enough, it came right down to the Commodore computer. Well, with money I had saved for the past year and a half, I went down to Target and snatched one of those babies up.

Well, then the learning began. The first thing that had to be done was to find a way for me to communicate with the computer. So the search began for a voice synthesizer that would not only give me key by key output, but also give me a constant voice update of new data occurring on the screen. So after doing some research, it came down to the Com Talker 64, and is what I have been using ever since.

Now that I have given you some basic material reguarding my background, let me now start explaining a few things to you that may make you think about how you feel toward this great hobby. Hopefully this series of articles will create a greater challenge for you, the user, and make you want to work more with your machine in a friendly manner. Let us first discuss how I do all of my programming. Since this will take some this is all that will be covered this issue, but stayed tune for more.

As stated earlier, I needed some way of communicating with my machine, since a screen was useless to me. This was accomplished with the aid of a voice synthesizer, a device that gives the user a synthetic voice output. Most people use this for games, business aplications, etc. So after installing the program in my system, and when I felt familiar enough with it, I then began programming. First the basics, print, input, read data, etc. It was great, for the first time I was actually able to communicate with my computer. But after becoming a much more advanced programmer, I had found flaws within the software that had been made for

4

the synthesizer. I had no way · of telling where all of the punctuation was within my programs. Commas, periods, semicolons, colons, and other symbols were not spoken, which made it hard for me to decipher prograns made by other computer hackers like myself. 'So that the misinterpretation of the word hacker is not created, a hacker to me is a term meaning a very big hobbist in the area of home computer applications, not a bank robber as the media has posted on us.)

Since realizing that the punctuation of my programs was not being spoken, I have made &amp; tremendous effort to somehow solve this problem once and for all. With this exception, I can type "list" and the entire program will be spoken.

Now that an understanding of how my output system works, let me explain how I first create my programs, and then how I attempt to type them in. When first creating a program, I first sit down and write out a algerithem, since flowcharts are fot actually helpful in my case, I resort to actual English outlines for my work. I ; then proceed to write down a rough draft of my code, which will then be typed in to the computer for testing purposes. So on comes the computer, and up comes the software for the voice synthesizer. I proceed to type in my code, I think hearing each key as it is depressed is very annoying, so I turn that function off. After typing in the program, I then debug it. This can i more of a hastle then it seems. By not knowing the punctuation used, makes my debugging process tedious and sometimes impossible. But after spending hours and hours creating a program, I feel quite proud of my work.

This is just a brief run down on how I first got started and how I indeed do all of my actual programming. Let me leave you with this thought. Look at the picture presented just before this article. See how the computer is shown with out a monitor attached, seems strange and different, but is it really. After

reading this first article, put down the newsletter, walk quietly over to your computex, sit down in the very comfortable chair that you got for Christmas last year, and flip the switch to the computer on. Leave the monitor off! Now type. See anything? I sure do!!

## ON-LINE

COPYRIGHT 1985 BY PAUL MOTISE ROCKVILLE COMMODORE USERS GROUP topics,

More On GENIE: This is the second of a two-part review on GENIE, the General Electric Network for Information Exchange, a new on-line service.

Electronic mail, a flexible and valuable GENIE feature lets you zap mail to other subscribers, with "carbon copies" sent to additional users. Unless you specify otherwise, your e-mail address will be your first initial and sur name (e.g., PMotise). Upon log-on your "mail box" is scanned and if mail awaits, then a table summarizing your correspondence is displayed, including dates, subjects and senders. Once read, letters are deleted after 5 days. GENIE offers extensive text editing for on-line work, but I suggest you save time.and prepare letters offline, instead. Take advantage of the ASCII text upload options-- you can type header info on-line and send the body of the prepared message, or by following their format, upload the entire letter at once.

The heart of GENIE is its "RoundTable: User Groups &amp; Clubs" section. Separate RoundTables exist for different computers, but all share a common structure. Headed by a club serves as a focal point and guru-at-large, each RoundTable has its own club notices, real time conferencing, a bulletin board and a collection of . downloadable software libraries. Club notices, posted by the leader, generally announce meetings, new software and added features. Every RoundTable has three real time conference rooms (more about which in a moment); you are alerted to conferences under way when you first access the RoundTable.

A RoundTable bulletin board is divided by subjects, called categories. The Flagship Commodore RoundTable lists categories titled News Rumors, Software Reviews, Programming 64, C-128, Amiga, Graphics, Teleconmunications, and Write Only Menory (a free-for-all area of oratory, jokes and fun). You access a category by first "setting" it via a menu option. Categories are further partitioned by each holding callers' messages. You can browse new write, read, and reply to, messages, as well as initiate new topics.

Software offerings, like bulletin board topics, are grouped by subject. Here, subdivisions are libraries, which must also be "set". Once "in" library, you may obtain its general description, display a file directory (including transfer protocol, size, and donor), browse an abbreviated file listing, and, of course, upload / download material. A feature worthy of special mention is the option to search a directory by key word or phrase, thus simplifying your hunt, say, for telecommunication programs containing the XMODEM protocol-- nice touch. Uploaded programs are quarantined until the club leader makes sure they're not pirated or otherwise unfit. Hopefully, this means at least some attempt is made to weed out "bombs" that erase your disk or play mischief with your sanity.

Using RoundTable bulletin boards and software libraries can be a tad confusing at first, especially due to their similarity. Remember that they are actually separate entities, even though, for example, a category and library may share the same name (as "telecommunications"). Keep in mind, too, that to reach a category or library, you must first do a "set" maneuver-- think of it as getting a "set" of keys to different rooms. You can "set" options manually, from menus, or have GENIE "save" them as defaults for your next GENIE linkup.

GENIE's LiveWire CB Simulator is typical of those offered by other networks. Available are 40 channels, along with a bantering (bulletin) board, "Adorable's Gossip Column", and "CB Mystery". Interesting attributes include the ability to monitor up to 4 channels at once, private mode, squelching, and conversing in scrambled text decipherable only to those who enter your

secret 4 character code. CB handles, up to 24 characters long, may be changed on- line or drawn from your default settings. Your banter is automatically headed by your handle, and a brief notice is displayed when you monitor/de-monitor, enter, or exit a channel. Status and commands display who's on what line, where they are from, and if callers are in normal, private or scrambled modes. I found the CB gang to be witty, outrageous, and fun.

Real time conferencing is like the CB simulator, only more "serious"; ereplace handles and formally named "rooms" substitute for channels. Each of the 40 conference rooms can hold up to 1000 callers. Commands parallel those of CB-- you may, for example, monitor up to rooms. However, added commands enhance flexibility. For instance, you may "knock" at a conference room door to gain admission. More importantly, a conference leader (any subscriber, by pre- arrangement) is endowed with an amazing array of powerful commands and options. For example, leaders may post entry notices, lock/unlock doors, hang "don't disturb" signs, obtain electronic transcripts of proceedings from GENIE's "stenographer", and even expel rowdy attendees. Considering the privacy options, including scrambled code, you have a terrific opportunity to hold low-cost national teleconferences; imagine a live Commodore user

To more experienced callers, GENIE grants a range of short cuts to speed system use. Experts can invoke a command mode to dispense with menus entirely. We lesser mortals may keep menus but skip around them by page title or number. Furthermore, a MOVE instruction lets you append a page number with a menu item number, thus spiriting directly to your destination. To top it all off, you can tag such a "macro" to your log-on string, to zip from log-on to your favorite location.

GENIE does have drawbacks and limitations compared to its rivals. Absent are hard copy newsletters or periodicals, third party extras such as the Official Airline Guide, and an on-line encyclopedia. No place on the system is free of connect time charges, not even the area for billing information. Most bothersome, though, and I hope infrequent, are periodic system slowdowns - text is displayed in short spurts; if you encounter this flaw, I suggest you log off and defer your session until another time.

All in all, GENIE is a good buy but lacking some goodies touted by other networks, the service smoothly provides excellent features in a well organized, easy to use, environment. New items are being added; documensuperb. I highly recommend GENIE.

## ALTERNATE REALITY expanded. There are 5 types of

CITY THE Datasoft

By Barbara Cramer

"Kidnapped by an alien spaceship, you find yourseli in a room wiłh only one exit. Through this opalescent doorway is The City of Xebec's Demise. Overhead is a panel displaying constantly-changing numbers. At the moment you pass through, the numbers freeze, Whatever levels of Stamina, Charm, Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Skill and Wealth you begin your adventure with are determined at this point."

Here the adventure begins. Not only will your character's abilities be tested, you will be asked to search for hidden doors, encounter, befriend or fight life forms, purchase weapons and clothing, etc. This is standard fare for graphic adventure games of this type, Temple of Apshai, et al. Alternate Reality is unique in that you have the additional options of securing food drink and rest from local taverns and inns, joining various guilds for help and guidance, and investing your profits at the neighborhood bank. The city includes 7 inns, 14 taverns, 3 banks, 15 shops, 4 smithies, 2 healers and 14 guilds.

I was very impressed with the complexity and realistic qualities of this game. Menus at the taverns change hourly. Prices and quality of goods vary from shop to shop. The people of the city follow a sociological order of realistic proportions. Banks are available to open various types of accounts as well as appraising l goods and oftering a wide variety of investment opportunities. You will become hungry or thirsty, and as you watch the sunset, you must be aware of the dangers of the night and prepare for the night's lodgings.

Character options have also been encounters influenced by which person was seen first and two menus of action which include sneak attack, lunge, attack, parry, trick, charm, ready or an item, leave, etc. The effectiveness of each depends greatly on the abilities and personality traits of the Character which are saved at the outset of game play for future use. Likewise, the potions, poisons and diseases are acquired in a variety of ways and can be dealt with in more than one manner.

Alternate Reality implies that it is set in the future yet the mood is not entirely convincing. Wizards, gladiators, dwarfs, magic spells and curses definate Medieval flavor. While this did not bother me, it is somewhat misleading from the package description.

The documentation includes partial map of the city on graph paper which 15 extremely useful. The description...of places, people. and actions is essential while still leaving many surprises to entertain and amuse you.

The graphics in this game are exceptional. The two title screens give you the impression that you are watching a movie rather than your computer. During game play, the graphic window shows you one directional vision in a scrolling manner usually associated with text-centered adventure games. Be ready to read the lyrics of occassional songs sung by shop keepers and tavern owners which may give clues to your adventure.

The City game does not allow you to interact with Weapons Trainers and some other institutions. You will also discover entrances that require you to use a disk you don't have. Alternate Reality- The City is designed to be expanded. Future additions include The Wilderness, The Arena, The Dungeon and The Palace.

Naturally, the complexity and variety offered in this game is likely to offer a few inconviences. Disk swapping occurs often and become irritating in the middle to tends your explorations. To improve your wealth and physical qualities, you Will have to spend many hours referringing the manual and mastering the options, an activity much like learning how to walk again.

While I am not an avid fan of this type of game, Alternate Reality is an excellent choice of entertainment. The variety of choices in almost every area of play will keep the game fresh and new while the promise of sequels will expand the Xebec world.

## SHERLOCK HOLMES In "Another Bow"

Bantam Software

A new genre of adventure games appeared last year giving us a more literary piece of fiction to read while we solved the puzzles of game play. Sherlock Holmes in "Another Bow" is an excellent example of this new style of adventuring. It is presented as 'living literature' and the first 3 chapters are included in the traditional printed form of the documentation. The disk adventure begins the second day of travel aboard the S. S. Destiny, an ocean liner carrying such notable personalities as Lord and Lady Astor, Henry Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Houdini, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Col. T. E. Lawrence, Thomas Edison, Alexander G. Bell and others.

The documentation is excellent including an annotated passenger list, dining times and seat assignments, wireless telegram rates and complete map of the ship. The graphics are confined to one third of the screen and load quickly throughout the game. One of the pleasant features of Sherlock Holmes is the use of a parser that understands much more than "Go west" or "Get umbrella". Responses and dialog is witty, Holmesian and creative.

While I did not even solve one of the six related cases,

I thoroughly enjoyed romping about the ship, meeting passengers and crew in a very realistic manner. I would highly recommend this program especially for Sher lock Holmes fans or adventure

gamers of any level experience.

## THE GOON I ES Datasoft

Interesting, Spelunker style mazes "provide the challenge in eight exciting screens inspired by scenes from the Steven Spielberg movie". This is one time I whole heartedly agree with the package description. The Goonies is very good whether you saw the rovie or not.

The Goonies is an excellent example of the run-duck- climb- jump games which require some thoughtful problem solving as well as flawless timing and fair eye/hand coordination. There's a slight twist in Goonies; You have 2 'men' instead of just one to get through the maze-like screen. A touch of the joystick button will transfer control from one character to the other. This feature allows the puzzles to be more intricate and interesting since the 2 characters Will have to work to-gether to reach the goal. The game play becomes much more interesting and more difficult as well. Even though I haven't yet made it through the second screen, I am enjoying the struggle immensely.
