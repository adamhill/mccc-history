## PROGRAMMER'S CORNER

Be Bob Lawson, Fl Night Chapter Librar isn

Last month we learned how to create a sprite froa scratah and display it on the screen. This month we're going to play around with it. Well learn how to nove it around on the screen and detect collisions with background objects, and, it space perrita, we might try gone othex things as wall.

Lat's get started. Twin on your computer and loed up the sprite program we created and saved last month. You did save it, didnt you? If not, here it is again. Ba sure to save it! In addition to saving this progran, In going to ask you to save the progran each tise wa socify it, By the tine this saries is complete, you will have a nice toolbox of short programs to Illustrate the associated with sprites.

When you run the program the sprite should be approximately in the center of the screen. Go ahead and iun it. Now let's turn the sprite off so we can adit our program. In DIRECT MODE type POKE53289, 0. The sprite should disappear. Il you type POKE53289,1 the sprite should reappear. All wave done is turn It off and back on The sprite, once defined and diaplayed on the screen will stay in nenory until the sachine is turned off or reget. This is an interesting feature we will use later. OK. Make sure the sprite is off and then list your progran The first soverent routine well look at is a vertical scroll 65 FORT=0T0750: NEXTT

All were doing here is getting up a delay loop, Remember, we talked about thes a couple of months aga) 80 we can see a starting point as well as the ending position of our sprite. Otherwise, the routine would begin executing as soon as the RUN cormand was issued.

- 70 Y=Y-1
- 75 IFY&lt; 48THENEND
- 80 POKEV, X› POKEV+1, Y
- 85 POKEV+21, 1
- 20 GOTO70

85 END

Now when you run the program, the sprite will position itself in the center of the screen, pause for a couple of seconds, and then scroll to the top of the screen Renessber our chart of last month? You right wish to take a look at it again, We established position Y in line 45. Now all were doing is decrementing Y by -1 each time the program loope at line 90. Thare are other ways of dodng this but I gilected to simplify things as much as posable so you could follow the progran flow. To scrall the aprite down, change line 70 to read y=y+1 and line 78 to read IFYY210THENEND. Now save your modified sprite. You night want to call it scathing like VERISCROL/SP.

- A diagonal ecroll is very similiar. The only difference is we have to define both the X and Y postitlons. Change your program se folloWEr
- 70 X=X-1.5sy=y-1
- 75 IFX‹ 24THENEND

You will! notice that I decresented X with a greater nuaber than Y. The reason for this is because the screen is wider than it is long and I was serely compensating for it Bo the sprite would reposition approxisataly in the upper left portion ot the acrean When you start designing your own sprites and movesent youll be able to put them wherever you wish. Again, to scrall in the opposite direction, us plus (+ ) signs in line 70 and the GREATER IHAN (&gt; \ syabal in line 75. Save your now soverent routine with scmething like DIAGSCROL/SP.

If the proverbdal light is blinking in your brain and you're thinking you can use the same technique with horizontal acrolls, well, Antique cath youre only partially right.

70 X=X-1

## 75 IFX ‹ 24THENEND

This will scroll your sprite left. Now BaVe your sprite with sonathing like HORIZSCROL/SP. Iry changing these two lines 80 the sprite scrolls to the right side of the screen. Woahl If you try to scrall past 255 you get an error reseage on the screen "ILLEGAL QUANITTY ERROR IN 80". You now have to use the sost significant bit in order to poedtion your sprite on the far right hand side of the Ecreen,

- 70 X=X+1
- 75 FORJ=155T0295 : HX=INT (J/256) : LX=J-256*HX
- 80 POKEV, LX: POKEV+16, HX
- 90 POKEV+21,1: NEXT Save this routine as MUSIGBIT/SP. Ihat
- 85 IFLX&gt;295THENEND

Save this routine as MOSIGBIT/SP. That covers all the soverent routines. As you can readily surnise, things can get somewhat complicated without an explanation as to what's going on inside your computer. By corbining thees routines, or, writing another short routine to have the computer sove your sprite randomly around the screen, you can design some fairly sophisticated ganes in

Now, let's nove on to colliaion detection This month well look at colliaions background objecte. use our latest modified sprite routine and make soRe Bore rodifications

16. FORJ=1T010sPRINT‹NEXIJ
2. 86 IFPEEK (V+31) = 1THENPOKEV+21 , Os POKEV+31, 0: END
3. 17 PRINTIAB (35)CHR$ (31) CHR$ (42)

That was not a very sophisticated illustration but if you think Is going to write your progran for you, guess again. You at least get the idea of how to do it. Save this Illustration as COL IO BKGD/SP.

Now that we've learned how to detect collisions with background objects we need to be able to nove sprites either bahind thes, or in front of the Location Vt27 handles thig feature. If the trailing data 1s a 1, then the background has priority. If the trailing data is a 0, then the sprite has priority. To Illustrate this, use the latest version of your program and change the IAB statesent in line 17 to reed TAB(3O) and change line 86 to read POKEV+27,1, Run it. The background has priority and the sprite appears to alide behind it. Now change line 86 to read POKEV+27,0, The sprite now has prickity and appears to nove in front of the background, You right want to save both of those illustrations for future reference.

Wail that's enough for this session. If youve been saving all these routinas you should have a collection of 8 short programs to illustrate various features of spritas. Next sonth well begin working with nore than one sprita, wall look at sprita to sprite priorities, sprite to sprite collisions, and multi-color sprites. Ihe fallowing sonth well with anisation so, right now, wate halfway hose.

My apologies to you advanced programsers if I appear to over simplify techniques but my contention is the simpler the explanation the easder for new computer buffs to frasp the idea and begin programing themselves. There will never be enough or too much in public domain And to you newcomers, it takes a lot of luck, sore very hard work, and some unique Ideas to get your programs publishad. Don't let this discourage you, however, because there's a lot of antisfaction Just knowing you creatad somathing which night be ussiu to someone else. Those proprams you create which don't quite Beasure up commercial standards, put in public domain. recognition and soreone elses appreciation can be very gratifying. Have fun playing with your new found skills and support our library. Until next month, HAPPY PROGRAMMING.

## Radio Corner By Harold Hetzal CCCC, Tucson, RZ

How about a modem for your car, or airplane? AT&amp;T and Bell Atlantic are experimenting in the Washington, DC area. They are equipping some of their customers with nodens that tie their portabla computers into the cellular telephone system. A number of airlines are offering a telephone link to any telephone on the ground. An aooustic coupler could turn it into your own personal flying

For the "do-it-yourself" networkers, Electronio Systems Technology (EST) offers a wireless noden for private networks. This network doss not tie into the conson carriers. It usas a VHF FM radio operating at frequencies batween 72.040 and 72.980 Mitz. The user can select one of 24 available channels and a unique address for each node on the network. The one watt transceiver hes a range of 1 adle with the 6" antenna and a range of 30 miles with an outside antenna. Could be very handy for search and rescue work.

Further information on these products can be received from "Creative Computing" Sept, 85 and "Transactor" Jen. 86.

Motorola, the big name in businass radio communications has announced two portable data terminals. The KDI 490 is designed to be sounted in a vehicle. It has a CRT display, formatted into 12 lines of 40 characters each. The terainal display was designed for varying light conditions, even direct sunlight! The KDI 800 is a portable systen to be carried anywhere, It weighs less than 28 az and neasures 7.5 by 4 by 1.3 inches. It has a LCD display of two lines and 27 characters per Line, a 56 position keyboard, programable function keys and a numerical calculator ped. It has an internal transceiver and antenna, operating in the 800Mtz frequency range. Outside of raclo range, the terminal has a built-in 300 bps telephone sodem to keep you in touch with the office.

Fontmaster has been so greatly improved there is little resemblance to the original The revision was more in the nature of a complete overhaul and the results are stunning. Fontmaster II allows the user control of every aspect of the printed text in the convient format of a word processor. The program disk is so thorough that several demo files have been included to show how various formatting comnands affect the printed text. It almost reviews itself! Just look at a few of the things Fontmaster II can do.

- » Font changes can occur anylinars.
- Up to nine fonts can be used in the same file. Over 30 fonts are included on the program disk.

A comprehensive review of Fontmaster II would easily fill nore than half the 80 page manual. Here are a few of the less technical features I found extremely handy. Fontmaster II works well with the Fastload cartridge and the package includes a free back-up disk! It supports 2 disk drive use and over 50 printer interface combinations. User designed Betup files are loaded automatically.

Plus, uss the included font editor to crsate your own good-looking fonta! (This font is called Headline and was croated by yours truly for the MECh.)

I was honestly hard-pressed to find any to present a balanced look at the program There does seem to be a bug which prevents underlining in a header and I was disappointed to find that I could not include more than one line in a page header. My only other complaint is that there is no flle nerging capability although you may bypass this problem by using the chaining feature, a little more cumbersone, but adequate.

: It will even center double wide characters.

Fontmaster II is definately for the serious user and will give you the control of a typesetter as well as a wordprocessor. I found it no more difficult to learn than any other processor and since I have been using it extensively for the last two issues of this newsletter, I find that I am now totally spoiled by its power and finesse.

The new Super Base 64 is out (version 2. O) Those of you that are using the 10 version and plan the upgrade or trade files with other users of that data base be forewarned that the new 2.0 version can use the old files but it CONVERTS the file in the process and the converted file will no longer be usable by version 1.0 and CANNOT be reconverted.

## THE LÜSCHER PROFILE

by Mindscapo Рахівн ви в.л. С.

Quickie tests that promise to reveal a new understanding of yourself are certainly not new to the field of amateur psychology. Magazine and bookstores are full of then. Now they have been added to the software shops as well.

Di. Max Lüscher, a Swiss pyschologist, has studied the effects of color on people and what it can tell us about our current psychological condition. The Lüscher Color Test, first presented in 1047, involves a series of specially-chosen colors which the test-taker is asked to rank according to preference. This ranking is then analyzed and a two page report printed for study and reflection.

The subjects covered on the proflle report includes

The test itself 1g incredibly short and requires lees than 15 minutes to take It amazes me that such profound personal statements can be made on the results of a person's responses to 7 color and shape tables. Little, almost no information is given to understand the use and interpretation of the results and the advice section (last) entirely too many "you should" statements. A bibliography for further reading includes 15 entries with Good Housekeeping' listed twice! Too many questions are left unanswered.

Your Mood Right Now Your Needs, Desires and Goals What Motivates Your Behavior Your Attitude Toward Enotional Involvements Why You Act the Way You Do How You Respond to Challenges What You Expect From the Future Things to Consider

Having been a teacher for 14 years, I hesitate to draw serious conclusions solely from the results of any one type. of evaluation. The Lüscher Profile may be valuable as a parlor game but let's leave psychological accessment and understanding in the hands of qualified professionals.

More On Iyanet: This is the second of a two-part series on the largest public network in the world, Iysnet. Best known as an internediate carrier for other networks, the service hes its own database, valuable as a training aid in on -line database work in general, and as an excellent source of information leade on a cornucopia of subjects. Let's continue our exploration.

Main nenu item 3 is, in my opinion, the nost intriguing and bountiful Iyunet resource. The option, database/time sharing servloes, generates a 6 iter sub-nenu that discloses avatlable services, and the companies providing them, along with detailed infornation about those firus. Opting for iten 3 will get you a lengthy roster of service classifications -a slate of 301 subjects, from accounting to walls. Topics range fron the familiar to the exotic and Includes auto racing, computer genes, exact sciences, film reviews, formula feed and sausage industry support, poultry, real estate, tickler scheduling, and weather. Researchers should note thase classifications that natch targeted subject material Let's say you hit the jackpot and discover your desired subject. The next step would be to find out what companies offer information within that classification. To do that, select menu item 4 Ihe result will be a display of firm names only. For example, I found 8 outtits offering hot poop on real estate. Should you want sore facts on those firms, choose item 2, detailed information about a company. You will then be prompted to enter the fira's name, which must have appeared in the prior list. What follows will be a fact filled description of the data provider: name, address, contact individual, phone number, a list of key words i en service classifications), computers (used by thems and a description of the service offered- - sometines the remarks include pricing infornation IRNs description, for example, stated that the company has credit information on more than 120 million consuners. I was also surprised to learn of an on-line service called Mnematics Videotex, a network aimed at the home market-which goes to show that you never know what goodies you'll be likely to unearth on Tynnet. If you would like a display of all firms offering data services on the network, then try picking menu item 1. The result will be an alphabetical listing of all 113 firms, from ABS to Xerox Computer Services. Along with familiar names, such as

Compuserve, you may be surprised to discover that Cornell University and kutgers University are among the vendors.

For the techies out there on the phone lines, lymnet's main menu item y, technical and user documentation, should be of interest. Ihis item precipitates a short sub-menu that takes on what should now be a routine, general to specitic, into presentation format. submenu otterings cover usts of all pubucations, detailed intormation on specitic documents, or the scoop on all printed Items. When 1 last called, a total of L publications were identified, ranging in price trom fi to sit. Egoteric titles include "Engine Liagnostics User's Guide", and "RAM Heterence ManualVersion 10.5". Also given are publication numbers, needed for ordering the goods. submenu item 2 will reveal detailed descriptions of any document. You will need to enter the correct publication name, however, prompted to do so. I would prefer to have Iyunet accept the shorter document number, but alas, you really need to enter the correct full publication name. I tried a wild card character (y') in the name, but Tyanet refused the short cut. However, you need not tag version numbers contained in the document titles. The descriptions are very helpful, stating the subject, targeted reader/uger, and related documents. Out of curiosity, I probed for details on the ELF Operators Guide perhaps diminutive system operators were at work within Iyunet's mainframes. Fact was more sobering than tantasy, though, as ELF stands Engine Load Facility. addresses the ELF program "which transters and loads NAD Image Binary (NIB) code into TYMENI Engine nodes and siots". Gee! Neediess to say, the guide is intended tor operations personnel, not santa.

Worthy of mention is main senu item t communications products verified by Tynnet. This option unveils a nice little plug about how the outfit is a "PC Friendly Network" and how Tymnet operatives are busy testing out various terminal prograns on different computers to make sure they all work smoothly on the service. A short sub-menu is unfurled here as well, The first option yields a table of PCs and corresponding software - very

Also for the technically oriented, or Just plain whacko, check out main menu item 1, nost procassor types currently intertaced on the network It triggers a bret sub-menu that permits you to see a slate oi host computer manufacturers, all modeis for a specitic nast, and all types of intertaces.

Iyunet, unlike what we have come to know as a "full service network", lacks chats, bulletin boards, transfers teleconferencing; but these features are the province of many of its custoMarE. database described here is strictiy gersene to Tyrnet's prinery function of delivering the electronic word of others.

The Tyanet sales office directory can be seen by opting for main menu item 5. A submenu lets you list your state or area and get the location and phone number of the office nearest you. The · first menu pick nerely displays a list of all 50 states, plus entries fox the District of Columbia, international and ¡ederal (what Iyment means by "area".) Sales offices are not in all states, but are regionalized, For instance, Wyoming folks deal with an office in Denver.

All in all, Iyanet is an excellent resource for all telecomputing enthusiasts. Price and system availability can't be beat. The database is straightforward enough to be essy to use yet sufficiently comprehenaive to provide valvable inforation to researchers and techie freaks alike. System navigation is similar enough to what you will conventional networks to be quite instructive.

## CRYPTANALYSIS

Santa Rosa CUE, CA

By Pat Pulliam

Cryptanalysis is the scientific study and conversion into plain text of cryptograms, ciphers and codes to which the key is not known. The ACA (American Cryptogram Association) is a non-profit, volunteer run organization devoted to the dissemination of cryptographic knowledge. The ACA's bi-monthly publication, "The Cryptogram" contains over 90 cryptograms of varied types including simple substitution, foreign language, mathenatical, polyalphabetic, polygraphic and fractionating. In each issue of their magazine, the Computer Column contains one or two programs written by ACA members. However, some of the basic statements need to be converted to run on the C64.

One of the best books written for computer users interested in cryptography is "Cryptanalysis For Microcomputers," by Caxton C. Foster (Hayden Book Co.). Because of Foster's book I have been able to get "my foot in the door" of "computer cryptanalysis" while my pencils stay sharp and my paper sits on the shelf unused. I must admit, though, that my solving record has decreased since getting a computer. This is due to the fact that I have lost interest in solving mast cryptograms for which I have no computer program. Ah, someday, I may have computer programs for all of then.

I have worked cryptograms for years using only paper and pencil The two hobbies, cryptanalysis and computers complement each other. Using the computer to solve or help solve cryptograms removes most of the tedium and saves much time. Cryptanalysis, on the other hand offers the programmer, beginner or advanced, many challenges and opportunities to learn while trying to devise programs to replace "paper and pencil" solving.

the prograns I have are my longer revised versions of programs from Foster's copyrighted book. Some of them will do everything except cook dinner for me while I solve. The study of cryptography is a time consuming, but fascinating hobby, made more enjoyable by the use of a home computer.

- 10 DIM B (80)

Following is a program for one of the easiest ciphers, a Caesax, which is simply a method of running each letter down a normal alphabet until a word is seen The tips for many cryptograms are given in Caesar cipher in order that the solver has the option to solve with or without the aid of the tip. Usually, I will use this as a subroutine in other programs, as an aid in quick deciphering.

The process nay be reversed by inputting plain text, such as your name, and choosing a Caesar cipher.

Are you getting lousy monitor color from your 128?

Sometimes it's O.K.? Next time it's bad again? IS THAT WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU FELLA?

Well, cheer up! The world is really bright. Things aren't always as they seem Some of us have older monitors and they came with the old 5 prong connector for the back of the C-64. They worked fine but the 128 NEEDS an 8 prong connector. Make the change and problem should no longer drive you buggy!

If ther is none, then type o REM "'space" and hit return. Now type POKE 2054,5 and hit return. Resave the program and your listing will be white. There are numbers for other colors, but they are more difficult to read on dark blue and would require changing the background color alBo.

## CHAPTER NEWS ARLINGTON

The Arlington Chapter will meet at 9 AM, April I2 at the American Airlines Flight Academy for the April meeting. A gulded tour has been arranged which will include visits to the Flight Academy and Reservations Center of American Airlines and the Training Simulator and Operations Center at the FAA Center. The tour and chapter meeting will end at the FAA Canter at 1 PM. Thaee who took the FAA tour last year can skip the FAA operations tour, it they desire, and watch the film The F-16 Thunderbirds.-Jonathan Ribe

## FORT WORTH

Those who attended the March meeting of the Fort Worth Chapter were treated to a Graphics display by Barbara Cramer and Laura Clements. This was followed by a brief question and answer period and then a software swap. Wa had the first chapter rap session for the C-128 owners. There were two 128s set up. About half the chapter members now have C 128g.

The next chapter meeting will be April 12 at 1:30 PM in the GDRA Roon 2. A reprecentative fron Startext will make a presentation of the Home Banking Syster. All interestad are invited to attend.-Jill and Gary Campbell
