## PROGRAMMER'S CORNER

Bu Bob Lavaan, Fu Might Chapter Librar dan

Last month we discussed at length an memory and month I like to ways of show you a few alternative creating your displays. To the novice programer, the most useful and easiest commands to master is the print statement. Not only is useful language Speed if approaches execution. little bit of creativity, it's possible to create screen displays which rival language routines that are entertaining watch. Here's a simple example to display program instructions:

10 POKE53280,0: POKE53281, 0: PRINTCHR$ (147)15 REM ** ENTER INSTRUCTIONS HERE **

20 PRINTTAB (10) "PRESS F1 IO CONTINUE" 3900 B=1

the liberty instruction to press the function 1 key ir line 20. enter you the ructions where indicared and line 39.55. test parameters at line 3955. In above routine, exception of the POKE statements which set the border and background colors and the POKE statement in line 3950 which changes the print the entire display was following statement. very similiar display using poke statements.

10 POKE53281,0: POKE53280, 0: PRINTCHR$ (147)

15 REM ** ENTER INSTRUCTIONS HERE **

20 PRINTTAB(10) "PRESS F1 TO CONTINUE"

3845 GETAŞ: IFAŞ=CHR$ (133) THEN3875

3875 REM ** CONTINUE PROGRAM HERE **

3850 GOTO3800

Again if instructions you wish to alter the simply routine in "l'ine 3845. As you can see similiar. Using routines, the poke state result is screen is somewhat slower but the advantage lies the fact that the second routine uses less code thus preserving memory. should now be obvious that the alternative to using the built-in editing features on your C64 is POKEing directly to

With that in mind it and graphics stateent. using the poke statements required to handle information following:

## Flex File 128

Review by Clem Countess

Flex File is , program for the an advanced database version C128. It is of Practifile 64, a rewritten also known Flex File 64. as The C128 version those programs but in is similar appearance and operation is greatly improved and expanded.

This new program is an outstanding example of programing that is designed to the increased speed, expanded memory capacity, and increased disk storage of C128 system. Flex File 128 is very the similar to Practifile in purpose, appearance, and having used the older user handling be able to jump into the new program will without even looking at the docs. C64 files are also transferable to the C128 readily obvious differences, a Directory command to the main menu. When operating only one disk swappıng the program and data disks. File 128 eliminates this problem by loading swapping to the data disk only once Monor for the remainder of the session. However, the new beautifully.

Flex File is self-booting in 40 or 80 columns on either the 1541 or I571 drilla! can be configured for single or drives. There is also a C64 version on this same disk.

Based on my limited use of Superbase 64, I suspect that Flex File 128 is not broad or powerful as that program, but it isn't necessary to take a six-week course to learn to use it. application I think the primary areas for Flex File organization nembership rosters, etc. It will permit you preselected Key fields such as alpha soet by lastname/firstname, bulk mailing. Criteria can be defined records to be printed: just hrough with no confusion. It is also easi to design and organize a printed report or address labels.

file created with Flex File 128 can have up · to 40 fields and 254 characters. with a 1571 drive, a file can contain as many as 8,000 records characters (such as of 31 or fewer names and phone numbers), or 1,100 records in a file of 254 characters each. Cut these numbers in half new feature added to Flex File 128 is User option that allows creation of reports in a nonsymetrical format, such as invoices or sales This sounds good, but the documentation ticketsin this area is lack have teatedtioniner fficultes wit

number of Practifile and with am glad to say that all of my C64 data files can be run and printed with the Flex File 128 program. Also, the Flex File 128 data can be handled by the Flex File 64 program, allowing flexability in sharing data between two computers. The

largest file I have created on Flex File 128 is a football pool with more than 300 people picking the winners in 20 games. That's a lot of data, and Flex File handles it with ease.

WOODSoftware P.O. Box 16193 Wichita, KS 67216 (316) 529-1861

I recommend this program for both the beginner and the experienced who have the need for a data base. Flex File 128 can be purchased from:

The price is $49.95, but WOODSoftware is offering Commodore significant discount Club Members. If for you are interested in purchasing this program, please see either Roger Hoggard or Laura Clements.
