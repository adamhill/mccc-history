## CHEAPER OR DEEPER

For reasons beyond my ken, it seams that Atari and Commodore owners have always had it in for each other. For years now there have been running arguments over who nade the better computer. Like Desocrats and Republicans, the correct answer depended on which perty you were affiliated with.

From here, Id say they both are.

Now there's the Ariga and the 520ST, and the campaigning has begun anew. Which computer is better?

It depends on your definition of better, of course. The thing to note is that the computers are NOT identical. Although on the surface there are striking sinilarities (CPUs, Rice, operating styla), underneath it all there are even nore striking differences.

Quite in contrast is the Ariga 1000. Jay Mines and the tear at Aniga took the opposite approach; building a computer fron scratch. Thay had the luxury of time in designing their machine, something the engineers at Atari did not have. Aside from the 68000 CPU the Ariga is designed from the ground up, in ters of both hard-ware and softwere. The graphics, sound, and memory sanagemant are handied by custor chips that

The Atari is built out of off-the-shelf components, the best ones a little money can buy. Jack Tramall's philosophy seans to be to build a superior computer from comprents he can readily obtain in quantity. 520ST contains a 68000 from Motorola, a sound chip from Texas In-strumente, GEM from Digital Reesarch, and other chips from other suppliers. There IS one custom chip in the Atari. It's nicknane - GLUE - belies it's function in making all the off-the-shelf components work together. Atari can put together a sophisticated machine at a reasonable prica and if need be, can probably obtain thome parts at a lower price in the future.

Vul. 4

Issue: 3

push the edge of idcrocomputer state of the art.

Stadlarly the Arigas beade operating ayaten is designed to improve upon others (ice Atari's CP/M e8), AnigaDOS follows all the latest trends Otice and windows admilar to the Macintosh, Microsoft Windowe, and yes - BEM for the Atari) but 1s also designed to improve upon the average DOS by baing utitaaking. This abil-ity for · computer to literally do two things at once is not something that can be retrofitted into · machine with any real success it sust be built into the Operating Systen from the start. In the Amigo, it 1s.

On the other adde of the coin, the Alige is a good valum but the Atari is an extreordinary one, and likely to remain one through price cuta.

So although the new Atari and Aadge computers are superficially idler, below the surface there are very important differences. The 800ST 1s a very powerful machine, the Adge 1s an extraordinarily powerful one. The Atari can accomplish things that few other cosputers can. Five years from now, the Andge probably still will be able to sake that clain.

Personally, I choose power over price. But is being cheaper such a sin? After all, low price was one of the prisery things that has made the Commodore 84 phononally succassful

But both are good computers. Which one is best for you depends on your needs and your pocketbook. There's room for both in the dcrocomputer worid, don't you think?

The Atari is cheeper. The Aadge goes desper.

Iyanet Ireasuress Most teleconputing fans know Iymet best, and perhaps only, as an intersediate carrier for other servicea, a local call to Tyrnet links you to the likes of Compusarva, and Dow Jones/Nows Retrieval, where direct 200aas would otherwise naan a toll call. Howevex, Iyanet is such nore than a nate vehicle. Run by the McDonnel Douglas Network Systers Company, of San Jose, California, Iyanet garves sore than 540 cities in the United States, and connects sore then 00 foreign countries. It's the largest public network in the world Prospecting bansath Iyunat's surisos function gateway providar reveala a veritable on-line tressure house for levels of telecomputing expertisa. For thoas of you in the novioe to interraciate class, Tyrnet's own infornation systen providas excaliant practica seasions valuable experience extracting inforsation from a databas the bonus 1s that there's no nead to out your teeth on expensive networks, nor face the routine astravation of busy signals attendant to popular local bulletin boards Intermediate to advanced operators will benafit fron the bountiful research data leads that Iyanet offers, links to nunerous firms supplying information on a wide range of subjecta, Best af all, there wonders are to be had for the vero cost of a local phone call, 24 hours a day, 7 days e weak, at low of high baud rateer no connect charges, sign-up fast, or animum tariffs. so, let's go prospecting and sea what treasures await on Tymet. Inte will be the first of a two part series

If youve never accassed Iymnat before, call the firtis customer service departuant at (800) 338-0149 to get a local rumber. suggest you raquest their booklet, "socess Locations', which lists their U.S. numbers by state, city, density, and baud rate. Next, sat your terrinal progres to 8 bit word adza/no parity, 1 stop bit, full duplex, and 300 or 1200 It would be helpful, if youre working with a 40 column display, to activate word wrap, because Iymet delivers text for an 80 column screen. When Iyanet detects your carrier, it will prompt you for a terminal identifier, type "A" and hit HETURN. Power users running at 1200 beud say be greeted by some garbege characters at first, until the systen senses and adjusts to your speed, don't fret--simply go ahead and type a RETURN, or else enter the identifier anyway. Next, you will be prompted for your user name, enter

"Information". A welcone sessage will then contirm your accass. The systen is senu driven but manu trees are short enough to be simple to use. Iheré's no expert sode, but a few simple commands and menu display detours are built-in to tacilitate your sassion. If you fall to respond to a prompt within about five minutes, Tyanet will return you to the log- on sequenoe, and shortiy thereatter disconnect you Aside from this break, you will have to terminate your gession manually to disconnect.

Iyanet's main menu is a 8 item seltexplanatory affair. I suggest that you commence by opting tor the finst item, help using the intornation service. Ihe resulting display describes system navigation, control codes and short commends. fox example, the conventional Contral -s pauses transission, whereas Control i resuras it and Control-C exite. Entering UP, IUP, or BACK Will rectleplay the main nenu furthermore, you can depart to the sign-on prompt by entering STOP, EXII, QUII, or LUGUVI. Io repeat a current sanu, upon completing your entries tor given item, enter END. Many ot these convertione are corson to other on - lne servicas and so, for novicas, are a gentle introduction to host systan usa.

Worthy of exploration is main manu item 2, dial up socees inforsation. Ihis option yields &amp; 7 item sub-sanu which allows you to abtain Iymet phone numbare in a variety of Ine information is structured in a simple annex, and is instructional of how databases, in general work, again, novices should gain from tine spent extracting facts via this sub-nanu For example, iten 1 lists all acoses nuebers by state and area--an inefficient way to determine the specific nusbers for your particular neck of the woods, but good for a sore complete referenca. A sore precise method to pin down your data would be to select item 2, listing phone nunbers by stata/area. After making this cholos, you will be prompted for the name of the state/ared, What tollows will be a table containing, for your geographical salection, cites, density low, sedium, or high--ties to networks via phones in low density areas may cost moreh, phone numbers, noden types, and comments, for instance, my search for numbers in Texas resulted in e roster ot it porta, from Abilene to Wichita Falla. At the end of the display, youre prompted for the next state, or a re-run of the current nenu, in case you torgot what you were doing. Keep routine in mind because the same procedure is used throughout Iyanet; rather than automatically redisplay a working menu after you opt for one of its items, iyanet late you make additional requests within a specific item You may alao want to examine

Thus, you could quickly idantify all porte running at 2400 beud.

Tymnet provides telecomunications sarvices around the world. Io get an idea of the planetary soope of the network's ooverage, gelect main nenu iten 4, international access infornation. Expect to see a sub-nenu here too. The first item of the sub-enu produces an ispressive slate of all countrias bestowed with Iyanet access. Ihe display reveals 70 ratione, starting (inexplicably) with Alaska, and encing with Thailand. Ihe line-up includes such exotic haunts ss the Caysan Islands, China, Gabon, Hungary, and Japan, The sub-sanu also includes an item (number 2) that reveals detailed access information on any country identified in the first rostex.

(This structure of presenting general and then specific data is comson throughout Iysnet's database.) Out of curiosity, I selected nuaber 2 and, when prompted for country name, entered "Alaska". In reply, Tyunet curtly told ne to see the entry for the United States - geography lesson, anyone? My quest for date on Japen was nore fruitiul, however. Facta on the Japenese connection were extensive, detailing ocmpany contacts, addresaes, phone nusbers, beud and revelations on cost factors--did you know that sonthly tie line contracte cost 21,400 yen for 300 beud but only 28,200 yen for 1200-aounds Ilke a bargain to nel Even if this news doesn't exactly thrill you, it should nonetheless give you sote inkling of how vast and complex this technology ig you night aleo use it to get attention at your next oocktail party.

One of the first things you should do is get yourself a Sprite Editor. Believe se, it will save you a lot of headaches. There are several comercial prograns on the market and there are several in Public Domain. You'll need one which prints out the data required to define the sprite and also saves it to disk. Sone save the sprite as a gequential file and some save the entire animation routine as a program I prefer the sequential file tormat because you can Joed m the spritels) independently and work your program around it. Aniration routines which are saved as prograns are ditticult to sodity without doing a complete rewrite of the routine, tor the sake of getting started, I'll assure you have no editor, so, we'll start tron scratch.

There are deveral steps to creating

SIEP1 - Detine the sprite

2 - Address the sprite register (53248)

3 - Set sprite parazeters

One of the nost fascinating features that the Commodore 64 has going for it is the ability to display and aninate Sprites. But, for the beginner, they can be a nightrare to progran Ihe users manual which came with your computer is virtually ugeless, and the Programmer's Reference Guide, which can be purchased at alnost any bookstore, is so tachnical that the beginning programmer can becone lost in a maze of numbers, commands, and SYNTAX. Consequently, only a stall percentage of people who nake a stab at programming really understand and mastex

My intent is to atterpt to simplify sprites ao that you can have as much fun creating then as I have had. Ihis will not be particularly essy to do because of the arount of inforsation youll need to digest. Ihig series was designed for the BASIC language programmer. As a result there are some sprite can only be perforned effectively in sachine language because of apead of execution. This shortfall should not be a deterrent, however, sinca there are still many things which can be perforsed quite effectively in Basic. Because of the voluminous anount of data which has to be covered, it is not posedble to fully interpret the gprite phenonenum in one newaletter article. So, beginning with this article and continuing monthly until the saries on sprites is completed, I will try to take you step by step, in progresedon, from the very basic through advanced programing techniques. The logical start point, I suppose, is with a charts

- B - Set sprite pointers
- 7 - Turn the sprite on

The first step is probably the hardest step to understand. Get yourself a sheet of graph paper and mark off a grid square that's 24 blocks across by 21 blocks down. Across the top of the grid, mark off the first, second, and ard 8 block sectors as follows:

1 2631 84268421

Now that you have your work space defined, well use it similiar to an artist's canvas. Simply shade in those blocks which define the shape you are trying to draw. After you have designed your sprite shape, go back up to the top of the grid and total the nuseric numbers for each shaded block within each 8 block section, Remember, each row will have 3 totals. Il there are no shaded blocks within an 8 block section, the total fox that block will be 0. There are 21 rOws of 3 sections each, so, when you are finished you will have 63 totals. Inege are the nusbers you will use for your data statements. Now we can so to our computers. Clear the acreen, set your background and border colors, and tell the computer you will be working with spritess

## 10 PRINTCHR$ (147): РОКЕ53281, О: РОКЕ53280, 0 15 V=53248

Let's look at the above chart and get our perameters. If you are working with 3 sprites or less, use the alternate chart. For nore than 3 sprites, use the prinary chart. In our example we are using only 1 sprite, so well uge the alternata chart. Clear the sprite register to prevent any unwanted data from

If you're following the program flow, the data statements I have used will draw a solid block the size of the entire definition area. y directions so the sprite, when displayed on the screen, will be twice it's normal size. Now aprite locations

I also expended the sprite in both the X and let's go to the positionine section of the chart and determine where you want the sprite displayed on the screen Youll probebly need to experisent a little to fariliarize yourself where specific locations are. Now get your 45 X=155: y=130 50 POKEV, X: POKEV+1, Y Set your sprite pointer. 5Б Р=13: РОКЕ2040, Р Finally, turn on your spriter 60 POKEV+21,1

Whew, that was a lot of work to display something totally useless on the screan As you become more proficient at drawing your sprites, however, your finished product will be well worth the effort, Wall, that's enough info to digest in one sitting. Be sure to save your progren as well be referring to it again next sonth. Next month the series continues with soverent and collision to background detection. Until next month.

By Glenn W. Sohreyer Reprinted from SYNIAX Newsletter CHUG, Inc. Tomball, IX 77375

I don't know about you but I have found that my printer has been one of the most useful parts of my computer systaa. Even so, I have found myaelf limited by the softwarg available for the Commodore 84 I have sean prograns for other computers that will print using custon characters, but not for my computex. I finally decided to write a program of ay own to do what I wanted, I hope that you also find it usaful I su subeitting e copy to the CHUG library to sake it avaliable to you as FREEWARE.

There is a series of four programs in the system I have designeds

The systen is currently designed to work with an EPSON type printer includes BPSUN, Gardni, HP ThinkJet) and the Speedscript word processor from Computel Publications. You can design character sats on any Commodore e4 syntas, but the program SPRITE is currantly gat up to work under this configuration.

- 1) FONIDESIGN
- 2) FONIPRINT
- 3) DA TO.SEQ
- 4) SPWRITE

The progress are described below.

This progras allows you to dasign your custor character eat. Thare are tho nodas of operation in the progran, Sequential and Select editing. Sequential editing recommanded for the bario task of designing the character set. This sode will take you through the character sat, character by character. You can stop at any point and autoratically pick up with the next character when you cons back later. The Select sode can be uned to pick out a perticular charaoter to noctify once it has alreedy bean designed.

## FONTDESTGN

To design a character, use the cursor key to nove around the designatad space 112 by 24) and enter some character (a.s. "a") to reprogant the dots to be printed for that character. Io exit and save the character you are working on, enter *.

A aarple character get has already been designed for you it is called "base". You can look at this character sat to age an exasple of how it looks.

The sequence of characters is listed as Sat 2 of Appendix E of 'The Consodore B4 Users Guide" and as Appendix B of "Commodore 64 Programers Reference Guide". The nusberg requested during the Select node are the numbers in this table. Note that only characters 0-90 are used and that character 32 is the Blank and does not need to be designed.

## FONTPHINT

If you would like to see the characters that you have designed betore you have completed the entire process, you can use this program to print then.

After completing the design of your character sat, you will need to run this program to convert the file from a direct socass to sequential file for use with SPURITE. A direct socess flle is useful in the design sode, but too slow for later usa. SPWRITE

## DA IO.SER

This progras is the print program. It will designed character Speedfoript file that you request, and print using the custos character set. There are spacing options available Normal, Proportional, and No Space printing of cheractara. Nornal prints each character usdng the same width. Ihis is usetul when you want to crazte tabular fornat. Proportional prints a character using the width of the character as the guide. Eng an 'Y" would print narrower "W". Some people consider preterable in letters, No Space prints no spaca between characters. Ihis option would be useful if you design a script type ot character get 8o that the characters would actually be connected.

This program has two versions on the sketta SPWKITE and C/WRIIE Stkilk is in BASIC and runs very slowiy. WWKIlt 1s compuled BASIC and runs nearly three tines as test.

## NEWSROOM DOUBLY REVIEWED

Here are two reviews of Newsroon, the now program by springboard software, Inc. We found the combination quite interesting since they are rather oppodte in viewpoints.

Review by Bill Brouillet Public Domain Librarian, Kankakee Hackers

Commodore Users Group, Bradley, IL

I as going out on a lisb and predict that this program will be salected as the No. 1 productive program for home computers in 1885. It was in the top 5 on most companies lista for October, AND IT HADNT BEEN RELEASED FOR A COMMODORE COMPUTER YEI On the day my order was shipped, the company I ordered from also shipped 1300 copies to other buyers. I was not the only one waiting for this product.

The first room to enter is the Photo Lab. It ig here you will take pictures of the clip art to be used in your newspaper. The original package you buy contains over 600 samples of clip art, and an additional disk can be purchaeed with another 600 samples. There are pictures of Just about anything you right want to write about. You can combine the clip art pictures, add your own artwork, provide shading in your photo, or add print with your picture. After you develop your photos, they are ready for the Banner Desk and the Copy

Having to wait over six monthe for The NewsrooM was worth it, However, I hope next time Springboard devalope a program as good as Ihe Nowsroon they progran it for the Commodore 64 firat. The Nawaroon is a system of programs which will allow you to prepare a newspaper or newsletter, including pictures, a banner and deveral styles and sizes prograss which are loaded from the senu, The senu is a Bales of six pictures depicting the six departuents . you can departments are The Photo Lab, The Banner, The Copy Desk, Layout, Wire Services, and The Press Each departrent independently from one department to use the next departrent.

The Banner Desk allows you to make a banner for your newspaper. It can contain photos to emphasize the main subject of the newspaper, as well as the name you will give

![Image](1986_03_artifacts/image_000012_93d4cbdd3eb15fc6c71cd1f3f6ee512edc7f57f2325606f4e247fa0e234ac60e.png)

the paper. There is a nice graphica editor ath this progres which 15 Biso used in tir hoto Lab and the Copy Desk. The editor allow you to use different print, different sized of the progress you night buy just for doing graphics Onos the banner is completed you must save it to be used later, just like the photos taken in the Photo Lab.

Ihe Layout Hoon 1s where you get to play editor and put together the banner and the stories socuruisted up to this point. Ihere ig not much choice in which layout you want (with or without a benner), however, this is where you decide which stories get top billing and what gets noved back inside the papar. It will not take long to layout your pages, but remember that a good newspaper should keep its readers attention from the front pege to the back page.

The Copy Deak is where you will spend most of your time It is here where your reporters write their stories and conbine then with the photos from the Photo Lab It's a good ides to insert your photo tirst, you will be able to write your story around the photo. Again you can sodity your story with the graphics editor it you desire. You wIll De able to write one screen, called a "panel", and then you sust name and save it. For a typical 8-1/2 X 11 page you will have one banner with six or eight penela and no banner. Ine only serious limitation to Ihe Newsroom is when you save your photos, banners, panels, or the tinal layout the names you use can only be eignt characters long. (hanks to Apple and/or 15M). You may have to use sore imagination to cose up with weaningtul names tor your saved work than you'll need to write the newsletter.

The Wire Services allows you teleconaunicate your newsletter to cosputers, inclucting IBM and Apple (that's why the limit on the names for your files), I have not used this feature yet, but I Imagine computer clubs will be sending their newsieters over the wire betore long. it may cost sore, but it's a good indication of how far our technology has gone. The Wire Services option will sake your newspaper as powertul as nost oi the major pepers in the Us 1 wouldn't be surprised it a bulletin board started up Just tor Newaroon users.

## (Nergroon reusu contred)

The final option on the rain menu is The Press room It is here that you will finally be able to print out your newspeper. However, before you can print your paper, you must set up the progran for your printer. The program defaulta to the Cosmodore MPS-801, which also accommodates the MPS - 803 and 1525. Fortunately for 1e, I was using &amp; 1525 so I started printing right away. Later I hooked my Gendni SG-10 to the ocmputer 8o I could test it There is a list of sost of the printers available for the C-64 and you must choose the one you are using and then must choose the interface you have. Ihe progran will save this configuration so that the next time you enter the Press Room you will not have to set up your printer. Why can't all progress be this

You night expect to pay ovex $100 for e program this powarful Micro-Aides can supply you with Ine Newsroon for only $40. The second Clip Art disk is a mere 824 I highly recossend this program, especially if you have any potential young reporters in your family. It can be used by businasars, schools, clube or any organization that has to report to its nesbers. We plan on including a newsletter with our Christmas cards (iron Print Shop) this year. Ive noticed that fewer peopie are saking as 'But what would I do with a computer?'

Review by Mike Lydon

Nowaletter Edito, Ihe Newport Computer Club, Newport, RI

wilthough the progran is fantastic fron the aspect of inbedding beautiful graphics into text and formatting two coluang of text that you norsally see in SOFTWORD, it does not allow me to IMPORT or EXPORI SEQUENTIAL FILES. I verified this limitation by calling the company. The custoner rep, said that they hadn't planned to add this feature. Ins oniy way Nowaroon can incorporate an article written by another club member is for that sember to also buy Newsroon so it would be written in the sane file forsat. Was this an oversight by the company or just a gimmick to get nore people to buy Newsroot!

To put together a newsletter, it is absolutely essantial to incorporate articles that are written by a word processor or BBS sequential Ille format. without this capability I would have to type the complete newsletter. This is too much work for one

Ed. Notes Our personal opinion here in Texas is that the progran is for specific applications and great for students wishing to produce a food-looking newspaper. The

MARCH '85

ability to alter and mix graphics and text allows us to use Newsroom for cartoons, borders and special effects while its text linitations cause us to preter Fontmaster II by Xetec, Inc. for text layout. We feel that the combination of thase two programs is unbeatable. BJC

## DIRECTORY AID

From the Greater Omaha CUG, Omaha, NE

to ning i. for a more understandablo directory, try using a suffix after the name you save For example, if your program 1a in BASIC, you can use the suffix "'BAS" 80 your program nare will be documentation file, una "DOC.", etc. Hare is a list of the generally accepted suffixes, many of which are used in CP/M.
