## Programmer's Corner

To the unknown author of this letter, change the quotation marks in line 104 to and the routine will work perfectly. At four o'clock in the morning, with a NL deadline staring you in the tace the same lay, prootreading can get a bit sloppy. My apologies Ior the inconvenience.

concerning another serious blunder article. His reply was to about it since no one reads these as these others printed in the newsletter can the novice programmer. And be very valuable the other authors, an obligation you the readers the very best we nave to ofter.

Last month I presented a rather shoddy routine to illustrate how the GET statement keyboard buffer. Again, at four o'clock in the morning, a tendency into terminal dumbness. As I stated, GET statement halts program execution and reads each keypress Goinge stored in the keyboard buffer sec statement conjunction conditional IF statement. Here's the correct routine:

short routine lines 20 and is stares timing urine inside the computer which still allows you to input the keyboard. Line 30 is delimiter parameter statement how DATA entries to read the program. Since whole idea of a routine of to respond a certain and, since the GEl statement only reads one keypress before continuing the program, a delimiter of l is comparison execution. initiated the GEI typed which is Remember, the keyboard buffer characters user input with the input. If there's a match, line 55 executes and line 60 loops the program for the next comparison. When all the conditions 70 ends the conditions are not met, the. rogram wil print each character sequentially that wa correct, print the error message underneath the program and print the word screen, and remainder os the keyboard ard buffer below the confusing, program several inputing correct and incorrect responses.

Several factes cans which an one a crawl, biggest computer. FOR/NEST 100ps where the varmable is tested (as in NEXIA) is considerably the simple NEXT.

there is one other point - would to make about s article. I have in previous that there are numerous ways to program and suggested using a routine GOTO with use of the ON statement. had intended to use this feature in s discuss but, it now.

As you progress you will, find that you preserve and you can assign program variables

- Io prevent SYNTAX error use GET the string symbol (GETAS)
- L Convert the string AS into a numeric value - ..A=VAL(AS)..

- 6 There are no restrictions on the line numbers in the list, the line numbers do not need tr be in increasing order, and the same line number may be used more than once in the

This is very nice because it having to do all of the above every morning.

4: Loads a customized desktop menu.

Using info obtained from CIS I have devised a way of using BATCH files on the C-128. Before we get to the HOW of this article, let's look at WHY.

- 1: Change screen anc cursor colors.

The 128 will autoboot a program when you power-up or restart the computer. Lets want to have the autoboot rogram do the following.

- 2: Redefine the F1 key.

Any Died the tory aft versed in you who is at all versed BASIC could write a program to do this in about 20 minutes. The catch is that if you have to rewrite big problem but a pain customize it for every disk you own! With a true BATCH file all you would have to do to customize the startup events would be to edit the file with a word processor text editor. This make very easy make changes to your file.

The secret to the BATCH file is a one BASIC program that is called by the powered-up restarted. program sequential read file AUTOEXEC. BAT. Then it does a SYS to the CHKIN kernal routine the computer to get information from the effect is very similar keyboard. commands in the batch are entered into the BASIC INPUT BUFFER and each time a return is entered the commands are executed. The following is an example · a batch file to perform The above stated autoboot program.

COLORO, 1 :COLOR4, 13: COLOR5, 1: KEY1, "CATALOG ON U9" DIRECTORY: SYS65484: CLOSE&amp;

several You the file contains BASIC commands Any of these commands would work in the direct mode. The file could be created with a word processor, a Terminal prg text editor, or BASIC program. SYS65484: closed properly close the channel to the drive. to the CHKOUT

routine and then close. The one line BASIC program (called by the autoboot sector) is:

10 OPEN8, 8,8, "AUTOEXEC.BAT": SLEEP2: SYS65478, 0,8, 0, 0

Thats all that is to open and execute the autoexec batch file!

1: Always use a logical file #

Some simple rules to remember:

- 2: Anytime you use the drive and to continue with the batch file (as in a the middle of the commands) you must use the CHKIN sys on the same command 'DIRECTORY: SYS65478, 0,8,0,0' This will let the batch file continue with the next command.
- 4: Multiple commands can be issued on a you place olon between each command and you observe
- 3: The CHKOUT sys and CLOSE8 must be included on the last command line of file: Note: This can be left off if the last line is 'RUN'
- 5: Any command line cannot exceed 160 characters in length including the return.
- closing I would like two good uses of the AUTOEXEC. BAr give you
- 6: test/demo disk she to program the 1571 create an autoboot sector that calls the one line BASIC program.

The first is for all of the 1670 modem. Place the following line in your batch file to prevent the modem from answering the phone when the computer is on.

pen2, 2,2, chr$ (6) +chr$ (0): print#2, "ATSO=0": close2: sys65478,0,8,0,0

The second is a customizing file that the colors way you like them. Displays directory Changes th 1670 auto answer default to the function key F1 to restart the autoexec. bat file.

от: 00385 6378,0,3,0782, KEY1, "BOOT" +CHR$ (13) DIRECTORY: SYS65484: CLOSE8

have used this concept on year old's game disk. AUTOEXEC games menu for him so that all he has to do is to turn the computer on. Give this some thought and I'm sure that you will find many uses for the concept of batch files.
