## Fixing Error 23

There will come a time when Joading your favorite and protest that. an error "2? This is a checksum has ocurreddisk uses a checksum DOS of the to provide first order error detection. It does adding all the 256 bytes together away multiples of 256 until the sector does not calculate to the same ocurred! You do lot know which byte got corrupter or if the checksum was bad. This is the easiest errol to work around. The technique is to read the bad sector into the disk RAM and write it back (which recalculates the checksum) to the disk. Then you can read the program in and fix it. This process is instructive in a BASIC program in that you examine i1 for an obvious fault such as a bad BASIC kevword or bad line number ode is more difficult in that it must dissassembled (or sector is examined) and searched for the

Pressing the left arrow key will abort the printout and close all Should you want a printout of files. the file, simply turn press your the F4 key printel on before you and the file will be sent to the printer instead of the screen. I tind this loads everytime I turn my computer on.

I it when I am going through my disks looking for a file or just browsing. Ihis way I do not have to stop and load or help ecause the filereader resides below BASIC nemor ASIC programs. Simply within your BASIC prg to activate the file you do not feel like typing in this program, it is included on most the CCCC 128 library disks as 'JHF FILE READER 128'.
