## CanDo from INOVAtronics

Amiga Software Review by Harold Williams

"What can CanDo do?" How many times have you heard that question in the past six months? Well CanDo has finally arrived and it is more than anyone could have imagined. The first sentence in the CanDo manual says "CanDo is a revolutionary, Amiga specific, interactive software authoring system." Revolutionary? It darn sure is! There hasn't ever been a product like this for any personal computer. Amiga specific? This is one of the best features. CanDo is not a port of software that was developed for lesser machines. CanDo was designed to take advantage of all of the Amiga's unique and powerful features. Okay, that leaves "interactive software authoring system." CanDo is a programming language. But CanDo redefines the concept of programming. CanDo allows development of sophisticated applications without requiring the technical expertise that other programming languages require. Building windows, menus, buttons, requestors, and documents as part of an application becomes as simple as pointing and clicking. CanDo excels at integrating pictures, sounds and animations into an application. CanDo applications can issue DOS commands, launch other programs and interact with other software through ARexx.

Each "card" begins as a window and then "objects" are added that allow interaction with the application. The deck/card concept, which is integral to the CanDo system, provides a unique programming

CanDo describes applications as a "deck of cards."

gadgetsery CanDo object can have scripts. These scripts are written using CanDo's script language. This is a high level language that includes over 200 commands and functions. The script language is very English like. CanDo scripts support the use of integer, string and Boolean values. Floating point numbers are promised in a future upgrade. String functions are numerous and very powerful. Math is limited to very basic functions. Hopefully higher math functions will be available when floating point numerics are

environment. The application program is created by using CanDo's interactive control panel to create the windows required for the application and then place the necessary objects such as buttons, menus, and fields on the window. All of the Amiga's standard gadgets are available from the CanDo control panel. Windows can have a close button, depth gadgets, a drag bar and a resize gadget. If the window is a document it can have both vertical and horizontal scroll bars. A window can display text, pictures or animations. A window might have buttons to allow interaction with the structured code. CanDo scripts allow for subroutines that can be performed from any script within the deck. The CanDo script language really shines in controlling CanDo objects. CanDo's graphic commands control and change the images on a card (window). These include the ability to load pictures and brushes, a complete set of drawing commands (e.g. DrawTo, DrawCircle, DrawPixel, DrawPolygon, AreaFill), commands to place text on the screen (e.g. PrintText, SetPrintStyle, SetPrintFont), commands to copy sections of the screen, and much more.

mouse or fields to allow keyboard input. The complete description of a window and its various objects becomes a CanDo card. A deck (application) can consist of a single card or an unlimited number of cards. The creation of a sophisticated interface for your application is as simple as deciding what objects are required and then selecting them from the CanDo control panel. Each Object performs functions based on scripts that are associated with that object's characteristics. Buttons can have scripts associated with click, double-click, drag and release events. Menu items would have a script associated with selection. The screen itself would have scripts associated with activation of the close button, resizing gadgets, drag bar and depth supported. The script language includes the normal program flow commands (e.g. If, Else, While, Until). These commands not only allow for program control but are designed to allow for nicely

There are commands to handle brush animations (e.g. ShowBrushAnim, MoveBrushAnim) and commands to control IFF digitized sounds (e.g. PlaySound, PlaySoundSequence). There are commands to handle documents (e.g. MoveCursorTo, PositionOnLine, SearchFor) and commands to read and write files (e.g. FileReadLine, File WriteLine). There is even a set of commands related to manipulation of icons. Other commands allow ARexx communications, execution of DOS commands, manipulation of CanDo objects, buffer control, and general control of the Amiga environment. There is a built in file requestor. Although I've just begun to explore this language, it is clearly a powerful tool for control of text, graphics, sound and animation. Creating a . For cample, sing the bo. tom be cambo control panel you might draw a circle. CanDo will automatically enter into the current script the correct command to draw that circle.

A deck can be tested any time during its creation. CanDo provides a browse mode that will activate the deck and allow complete interaction with all of the objects. If a script error is encountered the script is displayed with the cursor on the offending line and a message describing the error. There is also an on-line help facility. This makes debugging a fairly simple process. It is particularly nice to be able to run the application even though all of the design is not complete.

Once a deck is complete the resulting application can be run as a CanDo deck or it can become a complete stand alone application. CanDo decks are typically small because CanDo uses a library (a large library!) that is stored in the LIBS directory. If you choose to create a stand alone application it will be significantly larger since the required functions will have to be included in the project. INOV Atronics has also released a "CanDo player" , called DeckBrowser, that will allow decks to be run without the library. Applications created with CanDo can be sold or distributed without paying a license fee.

The CanDo manual, which calls itself "The CanDo HowTo Book", is written more as a tutorial than a reference. It is spiral bound so it will lie flat on a desk and remain open and the heavy stock used to print the manual will hold up to a lot of "thumbing." The manual begins with an explanation of how to install CanDo in your system. CanDo is not copy protected and you are instructed to work from copies of the original disks. The second chapter is a step by step tutorial for creating two applications. The tutorials are well written and provide a good introduction to the CanDo programming environment and concept. The tutorials are followed by several chapters describing the various objects that make up a CanDo deck. The last chapter (almost half the book) is a reference to the CanDo script language. There are also about a dozen pages of appendices. There are numerous example decks included on the CanDo disk. The CanDo disk also includes several text files providing corrections and additions to the manual. My disk (version 1.01) documents 28 additional commands and functions that are not in the manual. The manual is not indexed, although the appendices do include an index for the script language.

CanDo requires 1 megabyte of memory. If you don't have a hard drive, two floppies are recommended. If you intend to install CanDo on your current WorkBench you will need about 240K of space. This would not normally be practical on a floppy system. If you do not have a hard drive it is best to run CanDo from the distribution disk. If you intend to run CanDo created applications as decks you Will need the CanDo library in your LIBS directory. This could be a real problem for floppy systems as the library is about 120K. If you use CanDo to create stand alone applications, the library will not be required to run the application. Also, using the DeckBrowser will allow decks to be run without the library.

INOV Atronics lists a Dallas number for customer support (The number is listed in the manual three times and it is wrong every time. The correct number is on the disk in the ReadMe files). I called the number to ask some questions about file handling. The response was wonderful. The phone was answered immediately, I wasn't put on hold, and I wasn't transferred twenty-eleven times. The man that answered the phone not only understood my question, but actually knew the answer! He also told me that the INOV Atronics BBS had an example deck demonstrating the solution to my problem.

CanDo is one of those products that can't be fully appreciated without a little "hands-on" experience. There is a demo disk available from the MCCC library. Several applications that were written with CanDo are also available from the library, and on the MCCC BBS.

Here's a quick checklist of CanDo's good and bad points:

Good:

Bad:

- 2) Good manual
- 1) Remarkable Product
- 3) No copy protection

Okay, if you haven't caught on to the fact that I think CanDo is the best thing to come along since sliced bread, here's the conversation I had with a friend after I had spent one evening fooling around with CanDo.

Harold: "I'm only having one problem with CanDo."

Bill: "Oh, what's that?"

Harold: "I can't keep my socks on."

Bill gets this confused look.

Harold: "Yea. Every time I tried something else... it just kept knockin' my socks off!"

## 1541 Disk Drive Secrets (Part 3)

## C64 Hardware Information by John Ware Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Now that we know how DOS stores the file information in the directory we can find the file on the disk without any help from DOS. Look at the fourth and fifth bytes in one of the file tables. These two bytes are the starting track and sector of the file. For the file called "HOW TO USE". , these bytes are 11 and 00 hex. After translating to decimal this is track 17, sector O. If you view this sector, the first two bytes are a link to the next sector of the file. These bytes will be 11 OA in hex or 17 and 10 in decimal. Notice that sectors 1 through 9 were skipped. This is due to the interleave factor, normally 10. In the last sector of a file the first byte will always be 00 hex. The second byte will contain the address of the last byte in the file. The remaining data is just garbage. This area is another place you can use to place messages that can only be seen with a sector editor.

If you load a program file using "LOAD"name", 8,1" this load address will be used by DOS to place the program in the correct memory location. If you do not use ",l" the program will be placed in memory starting at 2049 decimal. Because ALL BASIC programs start at this location the "1" is not normally used. In general the "1" means two things: put the program back where it came from and start running

In the FIRST sector of a program file ONLY, the third and fourth bytes are the load address of the program. For BASIC programs these two bytes will be 01 and 08. This address is in the standard 6502 low byte, high byte form. Reversing these two bytes gives 0801 in hex or 2049 in decimal. If the program is in machine language, these bytes will be the address of where the program was in memory when saved to disk. If you see 01 08 for a load address, the program is most likely a BASIC program.

It you try to read a BASIC program using a sector editor you will discover that you cannot find line numbers or BASIC keywords the way they appear when the program is loaded and listed in the normal manner. The keywords such as PRINT, GOTO, and so on are converted to a 16 bit binary form and then stored in low byte, high byte format in memory. The same thing happens to the line numbers. About all you will see in a readable form is anything that appears in quotes when listed, such as PRINT "THIS IS IN QUOTES". · The THIS IS IN QUOTES will be readable but the PRINT command will not.

There are several types of copy programs around. Some will not copy a disk with disk errors, others will. The

If you REALLY understand how all the sectors of a file are located on a disk and how the sector links work, you can usually recover most if not all of the file if a sector goes bad. The first step is to COPY the disk, if possible, and work on the COPY, NOT the original. The same holds true for commercial disks. NEVER modify them in ANY way such as adding more files or using the validate command.

best general purpose copy program is one known as a GCR NIBBLER. This one will almost always copy a disk with errors, including ones placed on the disk for copy protection. Some copy programs allow you to set the starting and ending tracks. On these set the last track to 40. Others will allow half track steps and other options. The rule to use on copying is to experiment as there is no copy program that I am aware of that will copy everything.

After you have the best possible copy you can proceed to "fix" the disk (copy only). In the case of a short new, you must find the starting sector of the first file and follow the sector links until you see 00 hex in the first byte. This will be the last sector in the file. The tirst sector used on a disk

## "For files that have been deleted you can recover the file ONLY if nothing else has been written to the disk."

will always be track 17, sector 0, so start there. If all the sectors are good, all you have to do is create a file descriptor for it by hand using your sector editor on track 18, sector 1. Don't forget about the file type, sector count, and the sector pointers on track 18. Continue the process for every file you wish to recover. This will usually take lots of time and tries to find all of the files. After all of the files have been found, copy this disk and validate the copy or, file copy the files to another disk.

For files that have been deleted you can recover the file ONLY if nothing else has been written to the disk. If you accidentally delete a file, DO NOT validate or write to it in any way. To undelete the file just change the file type byte and file copy it to another disk or validate this disk.

If one or more sectors of a file have errors and cannot be read, read in the last sector BEFORE the bad sector and change the sector link bytes to point to the next sector AFTER the bad sector. Write the sector back to the disk. The file will now load but you WILL loose some data. Next copy the file to another disk.

"Fixing" a disk is not always easy to do and in some cases such as a long format, will be impossible. The best method to prevent disk problems is to ALWAYS use copies when possible and NEVER use the original disk for anything except to make copies from. When copying a disk ALWAYS write protect the source disk. If the original disk does not have a notch be SURE to place a write protect tab on the copy before using it. No matter how careful you are things can happen. NO drive is 100% reliable. They have been known to fail and go into a write mode and stay there. I have even had disks chewed up by my last son when he was cutting his teeth.

One additional thing about copying disks. All

commercial software is usually copyrighted including disks from most magazines. This is also true of some other software. If there is no copyright notice anywhere in the software, the docs, or on the label, then the program is considered not to have a copyright. The generally accepted rule for copyrighted software is ONE copy for personal use, not to be sold or given to others. Some software is known as "Shareware" and does not normally have any restrictions on copying but the author does request that you send him a small amount of money if you use the programs. The remaining class of software is public domain. These belong to no one and can be freely copied and given away.

To learn more about how the files are arranged on a disk just takes time and experimenting. Take a fresh formatted (long form) disk and save a file to it. Look where the file starts and ends. Then save another file to the disk and look again. After a while the BAM bits and the starting sector locations will start making sense to you. Experiment by changing a byte or two and see what happens. It is possible to fix a file so it cannot be deleted by simply changing the file descriptor byte. A disk can be fixed so no additional files can be added, where the directory will not list, and hidden programs can be placed on the disk. Additional information on the 1541 is available from many sources including the manual that comes with the drive. The programs on the test/demo disk are also usable for more information. These are in BASIC. List and study them to learn more tricks. Another source of programs to doctor a disk is the club library. Check with your chapter librarian. Some are useful in repairing or exploring disks. Also read the manual the Commodore supplied with the 1541 drive. There is some VERY useful info in it.

At the start of these articles I asked if anyone knew what purpose the small hole near the center of the disk was for. That hole is an index hole. Most disk drives use it for several things. One is to tell where on the track the first sector starts, another uses it to tell if a disk is actually in the drive in the correct way and to check for the correct disk speed. As most of you know by now, the 15451 can use almost any 5 1/4 disk. In fact I have used some that had so many disk errors on a 360k IBM format that they were unusable. These disks have worked for years on my 1541 without any errors. Disks come in single sided, double sided, soft sectored, and hard sectored versions. I usually use double sided, soft sectored disks and use ONLY one side for disks that see constant use. I use both sides for backup copies. The reason is that the direction of rotation reverses when the disk is turned over. If you open up a disk you will find a piece of what looks like cloth inside the jacket. This collects any dirt that may get on the disk. If the rotation is reversed, any trapped dirt may be transferred back on the disk. I have heard that this does not create any problems but because floppies are a LOT cheaper than new heads, why take chances?

A 1541 drive rarely needs to have the heads cleaned except in cases of extreme use or where there is a lot of dust and smoke. If you start to have a lot of random read errors, the first thing to try is to clean the heads. It is surprising how many times this has solved drive problems. I recommend the wet type of head cleaner. The dry type works somewhat like sandpaper. Both types are a disk jacket with a "disk" that looks like stiff cloth. For the wet type, put a little fluid on the disk and do a directory.

Commodore provided a way to use up to four drives on a 64 or 128. These can be any mix of 1541, 1571, and 1581 drives. Each drive that is on must have a unique device number. The default device number is 8 but this can be easily changed to 9, 10, or 11 as desired. There are two ways to do this. One is through a software such as that provided on the TEST/DEMO disk or by some copy programs. This method is called "softwiring" most of the time.

Other drive problems are caused by incorrect drive speed, incorrect track alignment, and electronic problems. These are difficult at best and usually impossible to fix without the correct test equipment and knowledge. Leave these to the experts as you can cause far more serious problems trying to fix these. There are many places that fix Commodore stuff and some are quite reasonable.

If you have two or more drives connected all of the time it is more convenient to change the additional drive's device number inside the drive by cutting one or two traces. This method DOES void the Commodore warranty. This method is actually simple and requires nothing more than a Phillips screwdriver and a sharp knife.

- Unplug EVERYTHING from the rear of the drive.
- Turn the drive upside down on a soft surface and remove the four screws located in the four holes on the bottom.
- Carefully turn over the drive holding the top and bottom together. Lift off the top cover.
- There is a metal cover over the main logic board held on by two screws on the left side. Remove these two screws. CAREFULLY lift off the metal cover making sure that you do not unplug any of the connectors.
- Look carefully at the logic board. There are two types. Type one has the two jumpers near the front center of the board between the two transistors labeled Q4 and Q5. On type two boards the jumpers are located at the left rear next to the chip labeled UAB1. These look like a 1/4 inch circle of silver with a narrow strip removed from the center. On both boards, the one to the front is J1. On an unmodified drive both will have a very small connection in the center of the gap., Set the device number according to this table:

| Device # 8 (default)   | Jumper 1 Jumper 2   |         |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------|
| 9                      | cut                 |         |
| 10 11                  | cut                 | cut cut |

If you cut the wrong jumper, just bridge the two halves with a little solder. Connect the power cord and the drive cable. Turn on the drive and test it. BE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO SCRAPS OF SOLDER OR METAL IN THE DRIVE BEFORE TURNING THE DRIVE ON.

## GEOS - Part 1

## An Introduction by Eldor Luedtke, Jr. Mid-Cities Commodore Club

I know most 64/128 users have at least heard of G.E.O.S. (Graphic Environment Operating System), but do you really know what it is? If you said an integrated software package, you couldn't be more wrong. G.E.O.S. is an operating system.

Ok, so you ask, just what does this mean to the 64/128 user? It means that we (the 64/128 user), can expect to see some very polished applications in the future. If the user base is large enough and the sales potential high enough, they won't be able to resist. After all, they are in it to make a living and good sales is good money.

When you think of an installed user base, do you think of all those 64/128 users out there? Most would, but how would it be to add to that all those Apple, Laser 128 and 8 bit IBM users. Wow, what a user base -- and this is just what we have to look forward to. I have seen G.E.O.S. for the Apple and the Laser 128 and Berkeley Softworks is working on the 8 Bit IBM.

OK, let's look at what G.E.O.S. really is: a machine specific operating system. The G.E.O.S. kernel is the heart of this operating system -- it's what makes it possible to run the same application on a 64 (under G.E.O.S. 64) or a 128/128D (under G.E.O.S. 128). Have you ever tried to run a C64 program on a 128 in 128 mode? Some will, some Will not, but running under G.E.O.S. most will in 40 column -- some in 40 or 80 col (G.E.O.S. based programs). Anyone that has used C/PM knows how this works, but G.E.O.S. goes a step further in that it is graphics based, with icons and pull down menus making it easier to use (no commands to remember). The kernel also handles windows, menus, icons and fonts. All you M.L. programmers out there know about the registers, A,X, Y and zero page. You know just how fast zero page accesses are. Well here's a little trick. Berkeley uses zero page as if they had 256 other registers as an area to pass parameters, perform internal calculations,

## (Continued From Previous Page)

· Reassemble the drive be reversing steps one through four. Be careful not to unplug any connectors or pinch any wires when reassembling the drive. This is easy to do when replacing the metal logic board cover.

The drive will now default to the new device number anytime it is turned on or reset by the direct commands. It can still be "softwired" to any other device number like an unmodified drive but you must use the hardwired address for direct commands to do it. If you feel that hardwiring a drive is too difficult ask another member of your chapter to do it for you. Some are VERY experienced in electronics.

The main two things to remember for trouble free drives and disks is to keep them clean and cool. Dirt and heat are the worst things for disks and drives.

and return values. I don't pretend to be a crack M.L. programmer, but what this means is that G.E.O.S. can pass information between program modules very quickly. Anyone who has used a 64 for very long knows that disk access on a stock 64/1541 is slow. The 1541 is really a very good drive, it's just slow. G.E.O.S. to the rescue. On the 64 version of G.E.O.S., about half of the kernel is a very good disk turbo system that makes disk access a lot faster. This is not used on the 128 version as the 128 1571 and 1581 drives are far from slow. The format is the same as a normal 1541/71/81 with the exception that G.E.O.S. uses an area not normally used in the directory track to store additional info on each disk file; eg., date last modified, author, ver. number, last updated (for data files) and an area for the user to enter a short note about the file.

There are three types of programs run under the G.E.O.S. operating system, Seq., VLIR (Variable Length Indexed Record) and desk accessory. The VLIR type of program is where G.E.O.S. shines, it gives the system the ability to run programs that are larger than free memory by using overlays (going to the disk to get program modules as needed) giving a small computer big computer power. If you're using an REU (Ram Expander Unit) with the application, fonts, desk accessories and data in a RAM disk, your application will run as if your computer had 330 kb of free RAM to work with (using the 1750 REU or compatible). The Seq. type of program is as it sounds - a program that runs its course from start to finish, one instruction after another. The Desk Accessory is much like the Seq. type file, but it is flagged as a Desk Accessory. These programs may be accessed from within any application. A few examples are a Calendar, note pad, calculator and an alarm clock. There are third party desk accessories like Text Print, that will print out a Geo Write doc in your printer's own fonts with underline, italics, bold face etc., if you're printer has these. (GeoWrite will print in the NLQ mode of your printer, but will not underline, or use italics, bold face etc. in NLQ mode).

Now for some hardware support. How about a system with a 1571, 1581, 1750 REU (for a 1571 ram disk) and a 1351 mouse? G.E.O.S. gives even the C=64 all this and more. Now you ARE playing with power. Or how about support for about 70 printers.

What all this boils down to is that when we see the 8 bit IBM G.E.O.S., the software developer will have a super large user base to work with. Instead of writing four versions of a package, they will write one, making minor changes between the different versions. What this means to the G.E.O.S. user is the possibility of some very polished sottware packages at reasonable prices.

Next month, we will cover what you get when you open that box labeled G.E.O.S. 2.0 for the Commodore 64 and 128. Until then, happy computing.

Amiga Software Reviews by Max Hagedorn Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Hello and welcome to the first of, hopefully, a regular article of game reviews and other game-related items. In these articles I shall not only give game reviews but also have game tips and secrets, game awards, and possibly maps and strategy guides. I can tell you that you will vote for the games in the game awards, and I want you to send me your tips and tricks for your favorite Amiga games. More info later.

The programmers of Beast are a group known as Reflections and the distributor is Psygnosis. In the manual the programmers state that they are working on a new, as yet unnamed, game with a totally unique new scrolling method. I can't wait to see how they top Beast.

First, I will explain my rating system. I judge the games on the following categories: Graphics - art work, animation, and speed; Sound - music and sound effects; Playability - are the controls easy to learn, and do you get better each time you play; Challenge - not too easy, not too hard; and Overal! - an average of all the ratings. Each category is rated with asterisks (*), from one to five.

In this article, I will be reviewing the following games: Shadow of the Beast, Blockout, and Hard Drivin'. Now on with the reviews.

## Shadow of the Beast

The place is Necropolis, the time is unknown. Many years ago a child was stolen from his parents by the Beast Lord and was changed into a being of incredible power. He was brainwashed and he forgot his past. He became the ultimate warrior of the Beast. One day all his memories returned when he saw his father sacrificed. The child swore revenge on the Beast; he would not stop until it was destroyed. You are that child.

This game is great! The graphics are superb, the music is fantastic, and the speed is unbelievable. As you can probably guess, I liked the game. This game pushes the Amiga to its limits. The game has a very realistic scrolling method that uses up to thirteen levels, each level scrolling at a speed slightly faster than the level behind it. The speed of the game is the same speed as most arcades. The music is fabulous and it fits the mood perfectly. I especially like the music in the final castle. The joystick controls work the best of any game I've played so far, although I wish it were possible to fall off the ladders when you were near the bottom.

There are a few problems with Beast though. When you die the game plays a death sequence that consists of a picture of your bones and a very dreary tune that lasts about a minute. This would be fine if there was some way to get out of it early! Also, each new area takes a long time to load, but I don't mind when I think of all the information the computer has to load. The biggest problem is figuring out where to go first. The manual makes it hard to tell what you actually have to do. Although there are a few problems, this game is still one of the very best games available on the Amiga in my opinion.

## Blockout

If you like Tetris (or any of the various public domain clones) you'll love Blockout. The manual says that the game is based on something called a "soma cube" but to me it looks like 3-D Tetris. The object of the game is simple. A wire frame image of a block is shown on the screen at the top of a well. Using keys on the keyboard and the mouse, you rotate the block and move it on the screen as it moves closer to the bottom of the well. When it hits the bottom, the block solidifies into colors representing the levels. When you fill a level, it disappears and the blocks above it drop a level.

The game is easy to learn and it even has a nice practice mode (the blocks stay at the top until you drop them). There are several sets of blocks from flat ones that are almost identical to the ones in Tetris to truly wacky ones that look like nothing I've ever seen before. Bonuses are awarded for filling more than one level at a time and clearing the well entirely. The animation of the blocks is amazingly smooth. There is no music during the game but it is unneeded because there are a lot of sound effects. Blockout is a truly addictive game. I highly recommend it.

Amiga Software Reviews by Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

## PageStream Version 1.8 by Soft-Logik

One really impressive feature about the upgrade that I need to mention right off the bat is that it came free without asking. Free upgrades are something that I have not seen before with any other software package. I like it. There is, of course, no guarantee that Soft-Logik will continue this policy, but for however long it continues, I will appreciate it. Now, on to the program itself.

Anyone who has been reading my columns for any length of time knows by now that I am sold on PageStream. It is the desktop publishing package used to produce this newsletter. I have yet to see another package with all the features that this one has. As happy as I have been until now, however, I am even happier now. So far as I have been able to determine, all the bugs have been corrected. When I say bugs, I am not talking about the screen melting variety that prompt mercy calls from the local GURU -- I have not had one of those since the last upgrade that Soft-Logik provided about 8 or 9 months ago. I am talking about the kind of bug where things just don't work quite right or as nicely as you might like. All of these bugs that I have run across have now been corrected. And in addition to bug fixes there are a number of new features.

First, let me cover the bug fixes. The on screen rulers until now have been almost useless. There are markers that appear on the rulers to show the exact x and y location of the pointer at all times. The problem used to be that each time the left mouse button was pressed, that position was marked on the ruler with a black line. The ruler soon became so cluttered so as to be unusable. That problem has been corrected -- permanent marks are no longer made. Another problem was with the "arc" and "ellipse" drawing tools. These were so unnatural and difficult to figure out that they, too, were almost useless. They have been fixed. There was one more small bug related to the separate window that allows the user to pick the tool to be used. With the last version, when you clicked on that window, it became the active window -- in standard Amiga fashion. The problem was that when you returned to your document window you had to click to activate it, sometimes triggering a long and unnecessary screen refresh. With the new version, after you click on the tool window, the document window becomes re-activated for you automatically (without the screen refresh).

Now that all those bugs are gone, how about some new features. The first, and probably the most important, is the ability to access multiple font directories. With previous versions of the program, only one font directory could be used at a time - and the only way to read a new font directory was to re-boot PageStream. For those like myself who have only floppies to work with, that became rather unhandy because a single floppy is far too small to handle all the fonts I need to have access to. Version 1.8 solves the problem completely. You may now specify as many font directories (or disks) as you like. Earlier versions scanned font directories at boot time to see what was available. With a single font disk this was an unnecessarily long process. With multiple disks, this would quickly become downright

jumping a bridge or doing the loop-the-loop? Would you joystick for the optional stick shift. The game is a little hard like to race through a speed course at top speed? Do you to control with the mouse at first but it's not too hard to want to do any or all of these but don't want to die in the learn. I would not recommend play with the joystick for process? If you answered yes to any or all of these steering. questions then Hard Drivin' is for you.

Overall, this game is great and with the new course disks that will be available soon and the fact that the arcade costs 50 to 75 cents a game to play, the Amiga version is better than the arcade.

I must apologize for the fact that the game I chose were some of the best games I have. I don't want to give the impression that I am easy on my ratings. That's it for this month but I'll be back next month (I hope) with more.

Tengin did a very good job on this conversion of the Atari arcade of the same name. The game has everything from the arcade including the instant replays, the breaking windshield, all the houses and buildings, and even the cow next to the barn that lets out a startled "moo" when you hit it. The graphics and speed had to be slightly downgraded from the arcade due to the fact that the arcade had two Amiga 500's and four more processors making six processors in all (or so I've been told). The sounds are even better than the arcade. I especially liked the cow because the moo actually sounds like a moo compared to the short honk on the arcade. The game can be set to be played driving on the right or left hand side of the road, and it can be set to use mouse or joystick for steering and keyboard or

annoying. To avoid the problem, PageStream now creates a file in the main font directory that contains the path and file names of all the available font files. At boot time, PageStream simply reads this file, quickly and painlessly, for all the necessary information. When a font is needed from an un-mounted disk, you are prompted to insert it. And any time you need to add a new font directory or when you have added or removed fonts, you can simply tell PageStream to re-read the changed or new directory. After doing so, the program automatically updates the master font list. This is the way programs should work. An excellent job.

Other changes or enhancements include better print quality, more PostScript options, and improved file requesters. I haven't really tested this, but it also seems that the program runs a little faster and that the display is a little crisper.

No surprise here, but once again I will recommend PageStream to anyone who needs or wants a powerful desktop publishing program. As far as I am concerned it is still the best around.

## Clown O' Mania by Starbyte Software

I bought this little game back in December. In standard fashion (for me) I just got around to opening it a week or so ago. I was very pleased. It's a maze game. The object is to guide your character, Beppo the clown, through a maze collecting crystals. The view is kind of a three-dimensional perspective view of the maze from a point to the side and above it. The maze itself is composed of flat plates but there are stairways, trampolines and funnels to get you from one level to the next within the maze. Each round crystal you collect is worth 1 point. The angular shaped crystals are worth 10 points each. When you collect all the crystals from a maze, you will move to the next maze to continue your search for crystals. There are 70 mazes in all.

Of course there is more to it than that. There are monsters. There are always monsters in this kind of a game. So you not only have to collect the crystals, but avoid or kill the monsters as you go. There are several tools at your disposal within the mazes to help you. The first type are those which are found on the floor of the maze. Beamers are blue rectangles. Stepping onto one will transport you to another beamer. Energy Boxes will increase your energy level by 10 units when collected. You will need lots of energy to move pyramids. Pyramids can be picked up and

then dropped if you have the energy) and placed in the path of a monster. A blue Pyramid will block a monster's path -a white one will destroy him. The other kind of tool to fight monsters are those that move through the mazes. Razors are worth 30 points when you collect them and they can then be thrown at monsters to destroy them. Jumps are worth 20 points each and can be used to jump (surprised?). Landing on a monster is worth still more points.

But there are still more surprises. There are holes at various points in the mazes. Avoid them -- they are filled with acid. There are power pills that will cause all the monsters to leave the screen for 12 seconds. There are areas filled with different colored plates. If you can set all the plates to one color (colors are changed by walking on them) you get a 10,000 point bonus. There are arrow plates that allow movement only in the direction of the arrow. There are blue plates that increase your speed. And there are even patterned plates which, when you step on them, will literally turn your world upside down. Not a good idea if you are being pursued by a monster -- control gets very confusing.

But that is really my only complaint. It's a minor one. Overall, I recommend the game highly. Give it a try.

The game has very good graphics, an entertaining soundtrack, and excellent game play. It will even store your name and last level attempted so that you can come back and start at that level later if you wish. There is one problem with the implementation of that feature, however. In many cases it is necessary to carry jumps and razors from one level to the next in order to have any chance at all. When the game starts, from whatever level you specify, you begin empty handed. This makes starting from any of the higher levels simply an exercise in futility. It would have been better to store the inventory which you had upon entering a level along with the last level attempted so it could be tried again with some hope of success.

## Xenon 2 - Megablast by Image Works

Another space shoot-em-up? Yep. A good sub-title for the game would be "Blood Money for Real People" Blood Money is what it reminds me most of. The general look and feel of the game is about the same. The music is just as good and the graphics are terrific. The game play is a little different in that the scrolling is vertical rather that horizontal, but other than that, the games are quite similar. There is one other basic difference however. Xenon 2 Megablast is not impossible to play. When Blood Money hit the market, everyone (myself included) raved about the

## SofTWARE TERMiNAl

new standard in graphics and sound. The problem is that no-one got to see those great graphics for more than a few seconds before being killed

There are probably two reasons for the difference in playablility. The first is the amount of control you are allowed. In Blood Money, the screen scrolled inexorably at a steady rate of speed. You were allowed to move the ship within the screen but there was no changing the overall rate of movement. In many cases this movement forced your ship into walls or other obstacles. In Xenon 2, you can slow the movement or even reverse it by pulling back on the joystick. The other main difference is that, in Xenon 2, the scenery is not lethal. You need only watch out for monsters - you need not concern yourself with inanimate objects.

The game comes on two disks. My only complaints are that the boot time is lengthy and that the two disks must be swapped in drive DFO:. The disks are also heavily copy protected -- so much so that the game sometimes has difficulty loading the Swap Shop portion on my drive. It has never failed but it sometimes has to try several times.

times in each level, you are taken to the Swap Shop where you can buy and sell weapons and other things in order to increase your capabilities. Among these are a side shot, rear shot, a zapper, a speed-up, a power-up, autofire capability and lots more.

If you like Blood Money but, like me, get frustrated by its extreme difficulty, try Xenon 2. I think you'll like it.

Don't worry, there are plenty of monsters. The game is not easy by any means -- at least, not from where I sit. There are all kinds and they come from all directions. Some, when destroyed, will leave bubbles of cash to be collected if you can. There are also capsules that will float across the screen from time to time. If these can be collected, you will be given special weapons. A couple of

## The Mystery of the Hidden Virus

An Amiga Horror Story by Johnny C. Kitchens Mid-Cities Commodore Club

This story starts in early December '89 when, for me, mysterious things began to happen to my computer. I had acquired Dev Ware's Anti-Virus much earlier in the year and I had installed it's anti-virus boot-block on my Workbench disk. This makes a colorful image appear on screen complete with Dev Ware's logo. The rule for this is, should it ever disappear or become distorted you probably have a virus of some sort. Well my screen disappeared. Both VirusX 4.0 and Dev Ware's virus checker showed the disk had a normal AmigaDOS boot-block. Viewing the boot-block showed just that. What I didn't know was that this was the start of a lot of problems and annoying delays for my computer.

As time went by I let the incident pass and didn't worry about it any more. I had purchased a new disk drive for my system since then and was really pleased with it. I was happy that is, until I began to get random read-write errors. I began to worry about the disk drive, after all Virus was monitoring things and giving me a good bill of health in that area. One read-write error popped up that really had me wondering. A read-write error on my RAD: and then one on my RAM:. My "info" file which was the only file in the RAM: directory. I couldn't open the window for the RAM:. I began to wonder if something else in the system was bad. In the meantime I was becoming more and more familiar with the operation of DiskSalv1.4. I was using it almost every other day. Sometimes several times a day. This takes the fun out of computers really quick.

One of my first moves was to get the Dev Ware software out. I tried to install the anti-virus boot-block back on to the disk. The program goes through all the moves, even confirming that the boot-block was installed. Only when I view it, it shows a normal installed boot-block. I began to think that the Dev Ware software couldn't work with my system anymore. I must have changed something. I pulled out another disk which I had installed the anti-virus boot-block and it was still there. I decided to take a chance and I turned off the write protect and pushed the disk in. Presto! The disk is now showing a normal boot-block instantly. I brought out VirusX3.2 thinking my 4.0 version wasn't working right. It showed no virus and viewing the boot-block showed it was normal. I don't understand this!!!

An unknown savior was about to come my way. While browsing the MCCC Club BBS file area I came across an interesting file. It was called ARTM.ZOO. This file contains the Amiga Real Time Monitor version 0.9. This is a very good file which monitors all phases of the Amiga. Hardware and software operations are all monitored. You can set priorities, stop operations, and much, much more. As I checked various operations I clicked on a box called "vectors". What I saw shocked me. On a line called KickTagPtr address 07f3e8 was this: "The Lamer

Exterminator!!!". What was the "Lamer Exterminator" virus and why was Virus saying nothing? I checked the boot-block -- nothing but a normal DOS boot-block. I dug out Virus with its docs and began to read. I thought that this Lamer may be the non boot-block kind described in the docs. I decided to use the kv program that came with Virus. I typed "kv -I" to make it look for the Lamer virus. This takes awhile as you have to go through each directory and look at each file. It reported nothing. I turned off my computer and rebooted. I decided to limit my computer to just two disks -- that way I would know that the virus would be limited to just the two disk. Amiga Real Time Monitor showed the virus was in the memory again. I read the Virus docs again. I noticed there was an option to make Virus check the KickTagPtr. It was -k. I typed Virus -k in my CLI. The now familiar Virus window popped up and immediately I got a message that something unusual was in the memory. It said it could be a virus or it could be a program using it, of course I knew what it was. I told Virus to fix it. I checked Amiga Real Time Monitor and sure enough it was gone. At least I was getting somewhere. The question is, where was this virus hiding?

I spent several hours clearing many disks of this virus. It had spread very efficiently, mainly because I have a habit of fixing disks using B.A.D. Every time I used B.A.D. the virus moved into the disk. I checked Dev Ware's anti-virus program and it now worked perfectly. What a relief.!! If don't have any read-write errors for awhile I'Il know everything is finally OK.

I decided to read the docs to Virus again, maybe I missed something. Lamer Exterminator virus is described as a really bad virus. Capable of causing random read-write errors - no kidding. As I read to the end of the docs I came across an extra bit on the Lamer Exterminator virus. It mentions that some versions of the Lamer can hide from Virus unless Virus is the first line on your Startup-Sequence. I sat there looking at this in shock. I quickly made a copy of Workbench and changed the Startup-Sequence. I put the line "Virus -K" as the first line, crossed my fingers and rebooted. As soon as Virus began to run it gave me the message that the disk in DFO: was infected with "Lamer II" virus. Subsequent tests revealed that if the line was was just three lines further down in the Startup-Sequence that it wouldn't detect the virus. This is one mean virus.

I had solved a mystery. Thanks Mr. Tibbett. Next time I'll read more carefully. I hope lightning strikes twice, directly onto the person or persons' computer from which this virus was created and.....

## Amiga By-The-Loop David Owens

Message from the President. Note!!! Make sure the Secretary shows up at the meetings from now on to write the Chapter news so I won't have to. Now, back to business.

Our first meeting of this year had a great turnout. I didn't do an official count but I recon there were around 40 people present. Our question and answer period is becoming more and more lively. We always encourage you to ask any questions you may have at the meetings. You never know, we might have someone who knows the answer. We had several news items of importance come up. Our library disks are now only one dollar each. I've heard that sales of our library disks have gone up because of this. Remember, this helps the club when you buy these disks. We have a great library, and the more we support it the better it will get. We also appreciate the donations that are given for the shareware of the month (or two (or three)). These donations encourage

Owens (me) gave some background information on some of the pros and cons of the package and then turned over the program to some Mac developers. The emulator was run on a one meg. Amiga 500 which limited the size of programs that could be run. After a few problems with trying to run programs too large for the setup, we did run several Mac programs. We were also able to read the Spectre format (Atari Mac emulator). We hope to see you at next month's meeting.

The presentation for the evening was given by our new Vice President, Ray Howard. He demonstrated two products. The first was Cross-DOS. It's a neat little utility that allows you to read and write MS-DOS disks using the Amiga drives. What sets this product apart from others that do the same thing is that you can have both file systems active at the same time. Either can be used at any time depending on what kind of disk is inserted. It is also possible with this software to access files and programs directly from an MS-DOS formatted disk via the Workbench. Pretty neat stuff.

simple uses. Thanks, Ray, for an interesting evening.

CHECk YOUR AddREss LAbEl programmers to continue to supply us with fantastic public domain software for our computers.

The meeting went well. Scott Lamb handled the News and Rumors portion of the meeting and fielded his share of questions. Best news of the evening was that Amiga sales are way up. And the new Amiga 2500/30 is selling very well -- in fact sales seem to be surpassing that of the 2000.

Our February meeting will feature DNet. This is a networking system that allows the Amiga to be linked to other computers. If you like to plan ahead, at our March meeting we will be getting down to Amiga fundamentals. We will cover the basic operations of the Amiga. Perfect opportunity for you beginners out there. I'll be seeing you at both meetings.

We have a permanent home! Come one, come all to the Richardson Civic Center at Arapaho &amp; Central (next to the library) at 7:30 p.m. every third Wednesday of the month. Besides the regular information swapping, problem sharing and New Stuff presentations, there are occasionally giveaways or special club-only offers to be had at the meetings.

## Arlington/GP Eddie Allen

The Saturday workshop and Tuesday night meeting had around the same number of attendees this month, one was upward, the other downward. Let's remember to check our calendar and be sure to attend the next meeting. We especially need your presence in the next few meetings, due to a possible change in where we congregate. Everyone's feelings and viewpoint is greatly desired.

This month's program concerned an excellent checkbook program that seems to cover just about feature you could request. It is intuitive and just detailed enough to prevent the "I

CHAPTER

wish" syndrome. It was written and donated by Bill Lamb from Forney, Texas.

Quantumlink made the second program, OmegaQ Il, available to bona-fide user groups for their members' usage. This is a powerful utility that combines the multitude of archival and compression packages together, along with extreme flexibility in the ability to specify your component configuration. This is a "must have" if you do any downloading over the telecommunication networks, with Qlink for the Commodore 64/128 being highly recommended. Viewing, printing, DOS commands, copying, converting formats, un-arcing, un-lynxing, un-libing, and other functions is contained under one umbrella.

The February meeting's agenda is to be a secret, so be there and be surprised. As always, we also look forward to good fellowship at the Saturday workshop. Until then, be careful and cheerful.

everybody does word-processing, some play games, some write programs, and a few even do computer-aided design.

John Sookma discussed data bases and how they can be used. He demonstrated SuperBase Starter, the package that each member received last year, and showed how it could be used to catalogue a compact disk collection.

Some of our members are having problems with their computers and peripherals, so our officers are planning a hands-on workshop. This will benefit those who are new to computing as well as those who may have grown a bit rusty. For more details about the workshop, come to our next meeting -- Saturday, February 10, 1:30 p.m., at the library on Hulen Street.

print it out, that is when you see the results of this feature. BB format and the BB customizer are two utilities to help you set up TWS for your configuration (Printer and drives(s)). This is just a small part of The Write Stuff. TWS has many, many more features that are fantastic to learn! As for the prices, it is approximately $22 for the C64 version and $26 for the 128 version. Add $4 for SAM to talk to you and read your documents to you (or a chid). Contact Brad Dumler at 483-2332 if you are interested or on the ASCII BBS. One more thing for TWS -- here is the "proof of the pudding". I typed up this article using TWS!

John Ware discussed some general facts about word processors. He mentioned about converting files from PETASCII to ASCII and back. He also mentioned about up- and down-loading files to bulletin boards. One of the most stressed subjects is that you need to try out different word processors before actually settling down on one particular WP. This can be done by renting the software or coming to our monthly meetings and learning about them.

The next meeting will be held on February 17th at the Hurst Recreation Center at 1:30 PM. There will be a demo on Superbase, A Database program.

Jesse Carden talked about a little word processor called "The Letter Writer. It is a real simple, public domain word processor that you can copy from Jesse at the next meeting. It does not have any spell-checking features or macros, but it is very easy to use.

The extra long newsletter this month is the result of two things. First, the numerous advertisments helped pay the bills. Second, you - the members - turned in lots of articles for me to print.

Thanks. And my aplogies to those whose articles still wouldn't fit. I'll be sure to get them in next month.
