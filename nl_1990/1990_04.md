## The GVP A3001

Impressions of Great Amiga Product by Bill Raecke

I recently became the proud owner of a new Amiga 2000. Inside this wonderful new beast sits the GVP A3001 Upgrade Kit. You have probably seen it advertised recently in the major magazines. The basic unit consists of a 68030 CPU running at 28 Mhz and a 68882 math coprocessor also running at 28 Mhz. It can be purchased with three RAM configurations: 0, 4, or 8 megabytes. The RAM is 32 bit, 80 nanosecond SIMM configuration. It also comes with a hard drive controller for an IBM AT style drive. The drive itself comes in 40 or 80 megabyte flavors and can be purchased as part of the package.

The unit I bought was a 4 megabyte version with no hard drive. I decided against the drive because I felt I would be better off with the more standard SCSI configuration which provides the ability to add other devices easily later on. I figured the 4 megabytes of RAM would do for now (the 5 meg total will be twice as much RAM as I am used to) and the additional 4 meg can be added later simply by plugging it in.

I chose the GVP over the Commodore product for a several reasons: The GVP A3001 is faster. The GVP is expandable to 8 megabytes rather than just 4. The RAM and chips are plug-in rather than soldered which will make future expansions and upgrades easier for klutzes like me.

The board (actually two boards sandwiched together) fits into the CPU slot inside the Amiga 2000. The CPU slot is the one just to the left of the drives and fan. This configuration leaves all the normal Amiga and IBM slots available for future expansion. Installation was no problem at all. A minute or so to remove the Amiga cover, a few seconds to plug in the board, and then another minute or so to put it back together. What wasn't quite so easy was the installation of the switch. What switch, you ask? Commodore's 68030 accelerator board provides a software switch to allow you to boot with either the 68030 or the standard 68000. By holding both mouse buttons at boot time, you cause a menu to appear on the screen from which you can select the CPU you desire. The GVP board is not quite that friendly. With GVP, you must connect a jumper on the board itself. The instruction manual gives you two ways to do this: You can open the case and connect the jumper to select the 68000 (and of course open it again to reverse the procedure when you want your 68030 back) or you can install a switch. Obviously the switch is the only reasonable solution. That being the case, I wonder why GVP didn't supply the switch. At any rate, I gave Roger Hoggard of Sof-Tex a call and he fixed me up with a switch which I was able to mount to the back of the Amiga by drilling a hole through the removable plate just to the rear of the GVP board. It works fine, but it's still nowhere near as simple and elegant as Commodore's solution. So much for my only complaint.

At boot time I am running the SetCPU program by Dave Haynie. This program (among other things) allows control over the instruction and data caches that are built into the 68030 processor. It also allows the standard Amiga 256K ROM to be relocated into 32 bit Fast RAM for a big speed increase. My Startup-Sequence turns on both caches, enables BURST mode, and relocates ROM. This gives me the fastest possible configuration. And fast hardly describes it. What I was expecting was a big increase in processing capabilities. I figured that things like spreadsheets, Mandelbrot programs, and desktop publishing packages would run a lot faster. What surprised me was the general speedup of everything. It's kind of like the first time you add fast RAM to your system and everything is so much snappier - only this is much more so. The first time I loaded TxEd Plus from RAD I felt as though the monitor had reached out and slapped me. The speed increase is phenomenal. Everything is instantaneous.

How does it work? Much better than I expected. I expected all my productivity software to work just fine, only faster, and it did. I have had no problems running word processors, spreadsheets, data bases or anything of that sort. What I expected was problems with games. I thought that they would either not run at all or that would run so fast as to be unplayable. That has proven to be true in some instances (hence the need for the switch mentioned above), but most things seem to run just as they always have. Quite a surprise. That means that a lot of programmers out there have been doing what they should and timing their actions rather than just going full speed.

## QIX by TAITO

## A C=64/128 Software Review by Eldor Luedtke Jr. Mid-Cities Commodore Club

You hear a lot about computer viruses these days, but how many play games with them? QI (pronounced kicks) Will give you the chance to do just this. Well; you really fight the virus in QIX. Some may remember the 1981 classic for the C=64. Well, it's not just back, it's improved and has on the same disk a 128 version. Say what? Did he say there was a 128 version of this game? That's right, on the flip side of the disk is a 128 version.

anywhere with this one. Scoring is based on the size of the area you mark off and the speed you do it at. (An area worth 250 points drawn fast would be worth 500 points if drawn slow.)

The things most notable about the 128 version are: (1) It's all in RAM at once (the C=64 version goes to disk for each level and tune) and (2) it keeps the high scores on disk (The C=64 version does not).

Now let's look at what they did to QIX to make it better. The game is for the most part the same as the old version but it now sports fill patterns (and not just solid fill) and it has some really good tunes if you like rock -- and I do. To play the game you must draw lines to block off areas of computer RAM to immunize them against the QIX (each area is filled with a pattern when protected). To do this you must avoid the QIX, Sparx and Spritz. If they can, they will destroy you. Now, drawing lines to fill in a big rectangle may not sound like a challenging game to you, but it is. You will need to stay on the move and think fast to make it

This game is colorful and fast paced, and comes with a warning on the box, "Video General's Warning: Oix may impair your ability to enjoy ordinary home video games" -and it just might be true. If you have tried the old Qix and liked it, you'll love the new one.

As for rating this one, it's very good. If you have a 128 and play games, you need to get this one. If you use a C=64 it won't keep your high scores and it goes to the drive now and then but game play is the same -- great. Oh yeah, the price is right too. I paid $14.99 + tax = $16.11

## The GVP A3001 (Continued From Page 1)

There is a little program on the BBS called Speed that provides you with the actual Mhz rating of your machine. It then performs a benchmark test to compare the actual system performance of your machine to that of a standard Amiga and to an Amiga equipped with a Commodore 68020 board. According to Speed I am running at 28.46 Mhz. The benchmark showed performance that was 8.35 times that of a normal Amiga and 2.78 times that of an Amiga with the A2620 board. Not bad. Of course what really matters is the performance of real programs, not benchmarks. Keeping that in mind, I ran a bunch of tests on my old Amiga 1000 and then on my new Amiga 2000. You already know what my 2000 is like. The 1000 is a 2.5 meg machine with the Microbotics memory expansion. In both tests, the same background tasks were running so what we are seeing is a true comparison. Check it out.

PixelScript is the commercial program that I use to print the newsletter. It takes PostScript output and converts it to a bit-mapped image for output to a dot matrix printer. For the test I printed page 1 of the March newsletter. Amiga 1000: 13 min larch new before printing start

12 min. 05 sec. to print page

Amiga 2000:

02 min. 25 sec. before printing start

09 min. 13 sec. to print page

MandelMountains is a Mandelbrot generating program available in the library and on the BBS. For the test I rendered Example1.pic.

Amiga 1000:

59 min.

Amiga 2000: 09 min. 2 sec.

MandFXP-D3 is another Mandelbrot generating program available from the library or the BBS. It's the fastest available in the public domain. For the test, I rendered the basic Mandelbrot set. The screen was set to hi-res interlaced at 16 colors. Iterations were set at 120 and the Mandelbrot image was full screen.

Amiga 1000: 01 min. 42 sec.

Amiga 2000: 00 min. 13 sec.

Turbo Silver is a commercial ray trace program. For the test I created a view of the Robot Hand provided on the disk. The default system settings were used. I used the standard version of the program in both cases. A special version is available which will take advantage of the math co-processor but, to my dismay, I discovered that my copy is bad.

Amiga 1000: 12 min. 55 sec.

Amiga 2000: 03 min. 50 sec.

Lhare is the current favorite file archive utility. It packs well but is remarkably slow. For the test I unarc'd a file called TRAIN.LZH. I unarc'd from DFO to RAM. The original (arc'd) file size is 99285 bytes.

Amiga 1000: 01 min. 33 sec.

Amiga 2000: 00 min. 21 sec.

As you can see, the speedup differs greatly but it is never less than amazing. If you haven't guessed by now, I really love my new setup. I would not hesitate to recommend the GVP A3001 to anyone.

## A Comparison Of Amiga File Archivers

## Information from Harold Williams Mid-Cities Commodore Club

A file archive is a group of files that are stored in a single compressed file. Archives are primarily used to facilitate the transfer of files on telecommunication networks. There are currently five file archive formats used on the Amiga. Arc is the oldest format. PAK and ZOO formats have also been used for a long time. LZH (LHArc) and ZIP are the newest archiving formats. This article is an attempt to measure the efficiency of the various utilities that are used to work with archives and the efficiency of the

## "...Pak and Zoo are the speed demons for creating and unpacking archives. The best compression is produced by the newer LZH and ZIP formats."

different archive formats. I selected two groups of files for testing (see the chart below) and ran the tests with the latest version of each archive utility (see the list). I ran the tests with the archive utilities in RAM: and the test files in VDO:. The archives were created in RAM:. After creating the archive I then unpacked the archive into RAM:. Each archive utility was used with the default settings. The results of my tests are in the following three tables. Each table shows the time in seconds required to create and unpack the test files (the time was measured with a hand held stop watch). The resulting archive byte size is listed along with the percentage of the sum of the original file sizes. The third table simply combines the results of the first two tables.

Arc, LHArc, Pak, PKAX and Zoo are run directly from the CLI (consequently they can be run from a directory utility like Timm Martin's SID). LHArcA and PKAZip have Intuition style interfaces. Pak is unique in that no utility program is required to unpack an archive. The PAK archive is an executable and unpacks itself when run.

The data in the tables shows that Pak and Zoo are the speed demons for creating and upacking archives. PKAX only unpacks ARC files but it is five times as fast as the Arc utility. The best compression is produced by the newer LZH and ZIP formats. The picture file did not compress well in any of the formats. Almost all of the compression in Test#1 was in the program and text file. PKAZip did not compress the picture at all.

Please note that all the programs tested here are available at the meetings from the library or on the Super Disks and they are also available on the MCCC BBS.

## GEOS - Part 3

## C-64 and C-128 Software Information by Eldor Luedtke, Jr. Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Last month we looked at what you get with the GEOS 2.0 package. This month we will take a look at some extras you can get to add to your GEOS Arsenal.

First let's look at a package called DESKPACK Plus. This package replaces an earlier one called DESKPACK 1. There is more in this package and, unlike the earlier version, everything works in 40/80 columns. Now let's take a look at what it has to offer.

GRAPHICS GRABBER: The Graphics Grabber is used to import clip art from The Print Shop, PrintMaster and the Newsroom. These graphics are placed in photo albums for use in GeoPaint/Geo Write documents. I find that using the Graphics Grabber is very easy. I have all my Print Shop graphics (three disks full) added to my GEOS Clip art.

THE CALENDAR: The Calendar is one of those programs that can be a lot of help to some. This one is a desk accessory so you can call it up from within any application. What it does is let you put reminders for appointments, birthdays etc. for any day from now to the year 9999. To use it is easy; just open the Calendar from the Geos menu. It will come up on the current month (if you set the Clock/Calendar on the desk top). If you have any notes for that month you will see an asterisk on the date(s) you have entered info on. To see these notes just point and click on the day you want. A note pad will be displayed that may be one or more pages long. It does not print a calendar, but it does what it was meant to do well.

THE ICON EDITOR: The Icon Editor is not something I would call really important, but it's really nice. It's for just what you would think -- it's for editing or creating your own icons. A good example is a GeoPaint file called USS ENTERPRISE. The icon for this file is the Federation Logo, this adds a nice touch to the file and can be fun to use.

GEODEX: GeoDex is a file card data base for names addresses and phone numbers. It has a total of 12 fields labeled last name, first, middle, addr, city, state, zip, misc and groups 1, 2, and 3. The groups and misc fields let you search and print just the ones you need. An example: use group 1 for chapter, 2 for BBS (Y/N) and 3 for active (Y/N). This way you can look up all non-active members to try to get them back, all BBS users etc. Printing can be to a phone list, 1 inch/1 1/2 inch address labels or list all field data. This program is a desk accessory so may be called from within any application.

GEOMERGE: We looked at GeoMerge last month. GeoMerge was placed into DeskPack plus before the release of GEOS 2.0.

PRINTER DRIVERS: There are printer drivers and a desk top on the back of the disk, if you still use the 1.3 C=64 GEOS. This desk top is better than the one you now have and the printer drivers are faster and better. If you have any 128 Version of GEOS or version 2.0 for the C=64, you should not need anything from the back as the version 2.0 stuff is newer.

THE MANUAL: The manual is well written and easy to use. Even I understood it. It's also punched for a 3 ring binder.

## GEOCALC 128:

GeoCal gives you 28,672 cells to work with, so size should be no problem for most of us. Cell width and alignment may be adjusted to your liking. The screen can be split to look at two portions of your worksheet at once. You can scroll either screen for quick comparisons. You can name cells for fast recall. Most commands may be from keyboard or mouse/joystick as you wish.

There is a C=64 version of GeoCal and it works much the same as the 128 version. For this review we will look at the 128 version and, where I can, I will point out anything different with the C=64 version. Note: data from GeoCalc 64 may be used with GeoCale 128. I don't think it works the other way.

You can add, subtract, multiply, divide and figure percentages with accuracy to 12 places, take on complex trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic and financial calculations to 9 place accuracy. GeoCal also performs sum and average calculations. Scrolling through your worksheet can be done with the cursor keys (one column/row at a time), the cell reference box (to go directly to a cell) or the turbo scroll icon (Geocale 128 only, to quickly scroll in any direction). Holding the pointer against any of the four borders will also scroll in that border's direction. Selecting a cell or group of cells is as easy as point and click. To select a group just point at the upper left cell you wish to select and while holding the button move to the lower right cell in the group to select and release the button. Movement though the selected cells may be from left to right or top to bottom as you wish, you can also select an entire row/column by clicking on its row/column number/letter.

The command bar contains the following pull down menus. Menu items followed by a C=* may be used by pressing the Commodore logo key and the letter following at the same time without going to the pull down menu.

GEOS: GeoCale info and any desk accessory class programs on the same disk as GeoCalc.

EDIT: cut C=X, copy C=C, paste C=T, clear C=D.

FILE: close C=S, update C=U, rename C=N, print C=V and quit C=Q.

OPTIONS: paste function, paste name, define name, copy text scrap and names off.

DISPLAY: format, style, alignment and width.

The following is straight from the manual and true: Unlike some other spreadsheet programs you may have used, GeoCalc does not require that you learn a lot of complicated, or illogical commands in order to create and start working with your worksheet. Once you start up GeoCale you can immediately begin to type data into a worksheet that looks like a worksheet. In addition, you will be able to print out all or part of your worksheet just the way it appears on the screen.

To keep a short story short, GeoCale is very good spreadsheet program that is easy to use and the manual is well written and easy to follow.

## GEOFILE 128:

GeoFile 128 is a general use database program for GEOS 128. There is a GeoFile for the C=64 and I will point out differences where I can.

Running this one is the same as all GEOS based programs; from pull down menus using the point and click interface and keyboard short cuts in some parts. GeoFile 128 works in 80 column only. Data may be passed between 64/128 versions. You can set up a search form to print forms that match your search pattern or just find records that match to update them. Printing your database can be done one record per page or you can pack the forms to make the most use of your paper (if your form is not 1/2 page or larger in size). You may print only selected forms or all as you wish.

The first thing you will need to do when using GeoFile (after installing it) is to set up the file you wish to keep. First you set up your fields (this is as easy as drawing a box/rectangle in GeoPaint and giving them a name, if needed). Next you set the sort field. There are four types of fields in GeoFile: sort, comment, text and number. You may have up to 64 fields in a form, the form may be as large as one full page and you may have as many as 15 sub-layouts for your form. Your data base can have up to 30,000 records. You may put graphics in your database from the photo manager.

This one I will keep very short, GeoFile is very easy to use and makes a good data base program for anyone who just needs a program to keep track of a simple database. It will not do any number crunching and the only printing options are to print all, selected and the layout (prints current layout). It prints slow and uses only one font (no draft or nlq options). If you print only one form per page it slowly line feeds its way to the bottom as it seems not to know there is no more to print for that page until it gets to the bottom. OK, so you may think that I'm less that pleased with GeoFile. I am. I paid $60.00 for it and I really don't feel I got my money's worth. I think the price is down nowadays. I hope so as I would not recommend paying that much for it.

## WRONGISWRITE 6.2:

Wrong is write is one of those programs I use a lot. It's a universal text conversion utility that will convert from/to any version of GeoWrite, PET ASCI/ASCII. I use it to convert my 2.1 Geo Write files to true ASCII for my N.L. articles -- like this one (hey what do you know, I really do use GEOS). The version I have (6.2) works in 40 col only. Version 8 will work in 40/80 col and comes on Storm Systems disk 1. This disk also contains Font Monster (for creating fonts using GeoPaint), REU ZAP II (to load your REU with the files you need without manually selecting them each time), and more. The price is only $20.00. Make checks payable to Joseph Buckley. His address follows.

## PRINTIT:

Print It is a GEOS based screen dump program that will work with all versions and modes. It's a desk accessory so you can use it from within any application. It's compatible with the paint drivers making it easy to place an image of any screen on a GeoPaint page. This program was written by Mike Craig and can be found in the GEOS section of the C=64 file transfer area on the MCCC ASCI BBS.

## TEXT PRINT / CUSTOM PRINT:

Text print is a desk accessory that prints GeoWrite 2.1 files using your printer's resident fonts and allows you to use underlining with NLQ. GeoWrite does not support printing using underline in NLQ mode itself, so if you want to print a business letter that needs underlining, this one is for you. Custom print is the program that customizes Text Print for your printer. Have your printer's manual ready for this one. You'll need it for all the codes.

There are many P.D./Shareware files on the MCCC ASCII BBS for the GEOS user. There are fonts, GeoPaint pics, utilities, input drivers, etc. The list goes on. If you're not a BBS member, you might try to get someone you know to download some for you, or look in the club library. Some are there too, but not all.

If you're a GEOS user there is one more thing I want to point out, and that is a GEOS based magazine. It's produced using GEOS 128 and GeoPublish, and printed on an Apple Laserwriter II (postscript). The cover is produced using GeoPaint using color separation, sent by modem to a typesetting company for output at 1270 dots per inch on a Linotronic L-100 to film negative for offset printing. Seeing is believing, and then you may ask if an 8 bit Commodore really did it. What I'm talking about is GeoWorld. It's known as the definitive magazine about GEOS and as far as I'm concerned it is nothing short of great. To subscribe to GeoWorld send $20.00 (for 12 issues) to:

## Putty's Saga

## Amiga Software Review by Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Puffy's Saga by UBI Soft is basically a Pacman game. I should probably say that Puffy's Saga has its roots in Pacman because it goes far beyond it -- yet the similarities are there. It is a maze game. In this case the mazes are of the large, scrolling variety. Your character (Puffy or Puffyn) has to negotiate the maze, collecting Pad Goms and avoiding monsters (of course). When you have successfully completed a level by collecting all the Pad Goms, you are transported to the next.

The game can be played by one or two players. In two player mode you play cooperatively and two joysticks are

"Dragons themselves are harmless but watch out for that fiery breath -- it can even pass through walls. "

required. To start, each player has his choice of character: Puffy or Puffyn. There is more than just a gender difference. Puffy is stronger and his shots are more powerful. Puffyn will keep the objects that she picks up longer. It is possible to change characters during game play if you have a Magic Gom.

First the monsters. As I have noted before, there are always monsters. The most common monster is the Ghost. harmless but watch out for that fiery breath -- it can even pass through walls. They are invincible. They are also my personal tavorite -- they look great. Snakes, Eyes, Grrs and Hurricanes are some of the other beasties you will face. Each has its own strengths. There are precious few weaknesses. That's why you will need some of the bonus items.

As you negotiate the maze your energy constantly diminishes. Additional energy is used when you are attacked by some monster. To replenish your energy, you will find drumsticks scattered around the maze. Also scattered around the maze will be various items to help you repel or kill monsters better than your standard, wimpy, "normal" weapon. There are also keys to unlock doors and chests. Inside the chests you might find keys, drumsticks, Pad Goms, in fact just about anything.

There are many types of bonus items. Extra Speed and

Invisibility do the obvious. Transportability opens secret passages or lets you open chests or doors without using a key. Fire Power lets you breathe fire, just like a dragon, for a few seconds. But if you don't use it soon after collecting it, it goes away. Use it or loose it. Super Shot gives you six powerful shots that can destroy an entire formation of ghosts or chests. Repellency lets you frighten all the monsters except the dragons and hurricanes. Insensibility makes you untouchable for an entire level. Unfortunately, I have yet to encounter one of these.

Then, of course, there are the Magic Goms. I mentioned them earlier. With one Magic Gom you can get the Fire Power bonus, 100 points, Extra Speed, or a quick gender change. You make your choice with the function keys.

To make things even more interesting there are Doors, Trap Doors and Stun Tiles. Stun Tiles slow you down. Bad idea -- but you can counteract the effect by using an Extra Speed option.

There is more to this game than meets the eye -enough to keep you occupied for a long time. The graphics are cartoon like and quite nice. The sound is entertaining. The game play is a lot of fun -- not too hard and certainly lot too easy. Give it a try.

And I have to mention the high score table. Scores are saved to disk if you have your write protect off. But the impressive thing is the way that the program displays the scores on the screen. Rather than just displaying the scores all at once, the letters appear from the edges of the screen individually and then rapidly move into their proper positions. The entire sequence only takes about four seconds but it is very impressive. At the click of a joystick button, the scores are removed in the reverse manner. The letters scatter in all directions and disappear off the edges of the screen. I don't think I've ever found it necessary to mention a high score table before.

## Stairway To Heaven scored by Don Mortenson

For those who don't realize it, all Sonix music can be played even if you don't own Sonix. All you really need is Mark Riley's PLAY program. It is a shareware offering which is available on the BBS or on the library Super Disks. For your convenience, I have also included it on the disk with Stairway to Heaven so all you need to do is point and click. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_179.

Stairway to Heaven is, of course, the classic rock tune by Led Zepplin. This version is scored for Sonix by Don Mortenson. All the necessary instruments are supplied. This is one of the best examples of music I have seen for the Amiga. According to the doc file that comes with the score, Don spent a year on it. It shows. It is beautifully done and plays for a full eight minutes. As with all Sonix scores, it multitasks beautifully so that you can listen to it while you do other things. Actually I am listening to it as I write this article.

## MessyDOS by Olaf Seibert

It is implemented much the same as is CrossDOS. You mount a device (MSH) which then becomes your IBM drive. You can access it just as you would any Amiga device. If you put an IBM disk in the drive then access it device name ie. "dir: put an

MessyDOS doesn't sound appealing does it? MessyDOS does basically the same thing as CrossDOS does; it allows you to read and write information directly from and to IBM format disks. The big difference is that CrossDOS is a commercial product (although a rather inexpensive one) and MessyDOS is freeware.

with the new MSH:". If you Amiga disk in the drive you access it with the standard Amiga name i.e. "dir DFO:". The neat thing is that both devices are active at the same time.

If you have a need to transfer files to and from an IBM or clone and you haven't yet sprung for CrossDOS, you may want to take a look at this. Check out MCCC-A\_180.

## QED by Darren M. Greenwald

If you are looking for a powerful text editor to replace ED or MicroEmacs (both of which are very difficult to use in my estimation) check out QED. I am a regular user of TxEd Plus. I like it because it is very simple and natural to operate. You don't need to spend hours pouring over manuals to make it work. From what I have seen of QED it is much the same as TxEd -- easy to use, but with all the bells and whistles most of us will ever want.

OED is released as shareware. In order to get a fully functioning version of the program, you must register with a fee of $20 -- the version in the library will not save files greater than 10K. I'm not sure that I like the practice of releasing disabled programs and then delivering a fully functioning version only when the ransom has been paid, but on the other hand QED is a VERY NICE text editor and $20 is a very good price. I paid somewhere around $60 or $70 for TxEd. At any rate, trying it won't cost anything and it is worth the trouble. Look for it on MCCC-A\_182.

If you want simplicity, simply run it and use it. The standard amiga menus will tell you all you need to know. The program allows multiple documents to be open at once in separate windows (ala TxEd), and text can be copied from one document to another. For users desiring more power there is a built in command line language, an ARexx port, a macro capability, a custom keyboard configuration capability, and custom menu design.

## China Challenge by Dirk Hoffmann

each of which appears four times. You must locate two matching pieces which are "free" on either the left or right side -that is, there must not be another tile in the way. When you locate two such pieces, you click on each to remove the pair.

Most of you know either the Amiga game of Shanghai or the old game of Mahjong. China Challenge is similar to those. You are given a pile of tiles (called a dragon) which consists of 120 pieces. There are 30 different patterns,

There is another game in the library called Tiles that is much the same. The

It's an easy game to get hooked on. You'll probably find yourself spending far too much time with it. It's freeware. Check it out on MCCC-A\_183.

big difference here is in the way the game looks. Tiles is played on a simple blue screen. China Challenge is in full color and looks much better.

## The Rs-232 Standard - Part 1

## General Information from John Ware Mid-Cities Commodore Club

There are many ways used to connect a computer to printers, terminals, modems, and many other devices. One of the most common uses an industry standard known as RS-232. If you are using a serial printer or a modem, you are already using it! Have you ever wanted to transfer a file from one computer to another that did not have a common floppy format? If you understand RS-232 this is easy to do.

While almost all computer equipment makers had a part in defining RS-232, it should be no great surprise that the major force was none other than Ma Bell! It stands to reason because the phone system was already connected to almost every place in the world. A good part of the pins were to be used by phone company equipment. In those days if you wanted to connect a computer to the phone system, you HAD to rent either a modem or a box called a Direct Access Arrangement, better known as a DAA. Nothing could be connected to the phone system UNLESS it was furnished by Ma Bell. Some time later a company called Carterphone made phone answering equipment and they sued the phone company to force Ma Bell to allow connections WITHOUT phone company furnished equipment, among other things. The major result was to allow anything to be connected to the phone system.

The formal definition includes such things as what type of connectors are used, the sex of the connector, the number of pins, what each pin is used for, and the voltages used. Back in the dark ages of computer history every computer maker used a different method to connect terminals and other equipment to their computers. In most cases a printer from one maker could not be connected to a different make of computer. There was also the problem of how to connect terminals that were located a long way from the computer. It was not long before the need of a standard for connections was recognized.

Another standard called ASCII was also defined about the same time. If you look at your keyboard you will see many keys. Most have as many as three functions. As an example take the "G" key. You have a lower case G. With the shift key and the G key you get an upper case G. Also with the CTRL key and G you get a beep on most computers. That is three functions. The control key changes the function of a letter key into a control key. ASCII defined 32 control functions such as a bell, a line feed, a carriage return, along with others. In most cases these control characters will not "print" on the screen. They are for device control only. This results in 128 possible commands from a keyboard if you look at the letters and numbers as a command.

If you convert 128 decimal into binary you will have a 7 bit number. Almost every computer made uses either 8 bits, or some multiple of it, as the basic memory location length. Therefore the number representing a letter or control function can be stored in a single memory location.

ASCII even used the eighth bit as a check bit for the character. This provided a simple means to detect errors in the data. If you do much programming, a good ASCIll table is very helpful. You can almost always find one in a printer or terminal manual. Even today there is still one computer maker that does not comply with the ASCII standard for internal use. That maker is IBM in their main frames, but they do convert to ASCII to communicate with the rest of the world.

There were also other things such as Teletypes in use when the ASCII standard was defined. A Teletype used

'..BAUD rate comes from the old BAUDIT terminals. If you divide the baud rate by 10 the result is close to the number of characters per second being sent."

only 5 bits to encode the keys. Other devices used as few as 4 bits or as many as 6 bits Even the same bit length and pattern could mean sometiting different to two different machines. A 5 bit code device was often referred to as a 5 level device. Even though there were many bit lengths in use, all of these devices sent the code only ONE bit at a time, one after the other. As a result, it was possible to make a chip to convert the serial bit stream to parallel and back. Other things such as a bit that was used to signal the start of a character, a bit to signal the end of the character, and one called a parity bit along with functions such as timing and error detection was needed. All of these WERE provided in a chip called a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter or UART for short. This chip was actually the first chip made that was a COMPLETE function in a single package. This chip and varieties of it are STILL in common use! The only other thing needed was a standard timing pulse. This was, and still is, derived from the system clock.

If you measure the voltage in the transmitted data pin of a UART you will see a series of pulses going from 0 volts to 5 volts. It is the timing and location in the bit stream that determines what any single bit means. How fast the pulses are being transmitted does not change the meaning of any bit. Both the transmitting and receiving devices MUST use the same speed or else the bits will loose any meaning. This usually results in all kinds of strange characters showing on your computer screen. This timing is commonly called the BAUD rate: Why this is called BAUD

817-577-3470 Metro 1-800-526-5548 Toll Free rate comes from the old BAUDIT terminals. If you divide the baud rate by 10 the result is close to the number of characters per second being sent. If you have a printer that can only print 120 characters per second then any baud rate above 1200 baud does not decrease the printing time any.

There are three options available on most UART chips. The first is the number of data bits, usually from 5 to 8. Second is the parity bit that can be used to detect single bit errors in a character. Here you can choose even parity, odd parity, none, always 1 or always 0. If you count the number of 1's in the character you will get either an odd or even number. If you choose odd parity, the parity bit will be a 1 if there is an even number of 1's in the character. In an odd number this bit will be a 0. As a result there will always be an odd number of 1's transmitted. Even parity is just the exact opposite of this. The third choice is the number of stop bits. Here you can choose 1, 1.5, or 2 bits. Anything above 300 baud will almost always use only 1 stop bit. The BAUD rate is not normally a function of a UART chip. It is set by some other method.

Bit Number (or period)

The ASCIl code for an upper case A is 65 in decimal or 1000001 in HEX. Therefore when an upper case letter A is being sent, the data will look like the figure below. The bits are sent out least significant bit first. You will notice that there are actually 10 bits being sent. If you look at bits 2 through 8 you will find three of them high. This "A" is actually being sent with 7 data bits, odd parity, and 1 stop bit for a total of 10 bits.

In the above example, bit 1 will ALWAYS be a 0. Bit 10, the stop bit, will ALWAYS be A 1, but it can be 1, 1.5, or 2 periods long. The time period is a function of the BAUD rate selected. For 300 BAUD the bit time will be 3.33ms. The total time required to send the "A" will be 33.3ms. As the BAUD rate goes up the bit period decreases. At 9600 BAUD the bit period is extremely short. Most noise pulses are actually a string of extremely short pulses. A UART has logic that gets around most noise as long as the pulse is less than 1/16 the bit period. This is why lowering the BAUD rate will sometimes clear up noise problems.

I think that's a really healthy total. Every year we lose membership in January and February (because that's when most memberships expire) and gradually build back during the year. February 1989 and February 1990 were identical at 285 members, but we didn't reach 300 in 1989 until November. Of course, a major factor in our growth this year is the rapid expansion of our newest chapter - Amiga North Dallas. Congratulations to Craig Bird and his crew!

Of our 320 memberships, 173 are also members of the MCCC BBS. Here are some interesting stats for the month of February on the two bulletin boards we operate:

Exact information on downloads, uploads, and messages for the Graphics board is not available, but Okley says they are very low.

With 37 calls per day, it's no wonder that it often takes several attempts to get through to the ASCII Board, especially during the popular evening hours.

The trend toward 2400 BAUD modems is helping users limit the time needed to download the terrific PD and Shareware software that is available. (60% of the calls are at 2400 BAUD, 35% at 1200 BAUD, and 5% at 300 BAUD.) Okley says that if more people would limit their time during the peak hours and try to use more of the off-peak hours, it would be better for everybody.

It's saddening for those of us who "grew up" with it to see usage of the graphics board slowly dwindle. After watching the trends for about a year, the BBS committee has concluded that we need to provide some relief to users of the ASCII Board, and reported to the Board of Directors their plans to move the phone line which now supports the Graphics Board to the ASCII Board as soon as suitable hardware and software become available to provide multiple phone line capability. The time frame for this is unknown perhaps several months. In the meantime, enjoy the BBS's for their unique capabilities, and be courteous to your fellow users.

Actually we overwhelmingly ratified the name change proposed by the Board of Directors. If you weren't present, and you haven't seen last month's newsletter, we voted to change from the "Mid-Cities" to the "MetroPlex Commodore Computer Club" . With over 40 club members present the count was 30 for and 1 against. Those that didn't vote will probably vote at their "home" chapter. (The 1 against was me, just for color.)

Rumors flying around include the imminent release of the long awaited Video Toaster from NewTek. Workbench 1.4 someday. And some unprintable information that you had to be there to hear. Kinda' sorry you didn't go now, 'eh?

Our demo this time was about digitizing using the Cannon Xapshot still video camera, SunRise Industries' Color Splitter and NewTek's DigiView 3.0. Brett Hester provided the expertise and equipment and showed us some of the fantastic results you can expect from this combination of hardware and software. S u r - prisingly you can get into this setup for quite a bit less than retail if you shop around.

Our vice-president, William Dockendorf, presented a demo of "Tax Break" from Oxxi, Inc., which handles 6 or 7 schedules and can produce IRS-approved output forms. It has an on-line help disk (which makes a 2-floppy system almost mandatory) which contains all those irritating "see page 35" instructions tied neatly to the line in question. Any field which comes from a supporting schedule, or might have a CHAPTER calculation involved (i.e. multiple W2 forms) has a separate screen to key in the pieces, and the system Hard Warehouse keeps furnished us with a copy of Lucas Films Maniac Mansion for a door prize. Congratulations to Jay Johnsgard, the lucky winner.

We meet next time on Tuesday, April 10. Same time (7:30). Same place (North Richland Hills Church of Christ. Room 208).

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

We had a short but interesting March meeting, with a good-sized crowd. Thanks for coming! (to those of you who were there.) We missed you! (to those of you who reren't.) In general announcements, we heard about Amazing Computing's new store opening in Fort Worth around May 1, which will be celebrated at the Dallas location as well around April 21. We voted on the proposed name change for the club (from MCCC to MCCC), and tossed around a few individual problems with SONIX files, disk formats, etc. That's one of the best things about the club: Just holler "Help! My @#$% doesn't work!" and there's bound to be somebody who has just tried "@#$% version 1.4" and can help you out! Speaking of hollering HELP!, we were warned to AVOID "VIRUSX 4.4". ". It is not from the author of the original VIRUSX program, which is currently at version 4.0 and is available both on our BBS and through our library.

track of the totals. There is a constant "net result/change" displayed at the bottom of the screen, so you can see the effect of different options or entries. Although able to run in 512K, the Workbench must be disabled and you can't have colors, so more memory is desirable. Updates are available each January for $29.95, which includes software and a new manual. Also included is a good tax guide. Although William had some printing problems and several software crashes, of course the program would not fail while we were looking. Sounds like a good program for those who wear out several erasers around April 14th!

Next month we'll meet again on April 18th, 7:30 p.m., at the Richardson Civic Center at Arapaho and Central. Our librarian, Brett Hester, will present a demo of the Cannon Zap-Shot, a still video camera that stores pictures on a floppy. The shots can then be read and edited by various video and painting programs. Sounds like fun! Don't forget the upcoming picnic in May, too... see you there!

## Arlington/GP Eddie Allen

I was unable to attend the workshop, but reports are that it was well attended. The workshop does not have a formal format, so do not feel obligated to dress up for attendance.

Hank Costello (of Budget Computer fame) graciously presented the VHS recording of the GEOS Publishing demonstration that he originally unveiled at the spring thing in 1989. It's amazing how much of the little inuendos you can perceive in a subsequent viewing. This is an excellent video to watch, and would be worthwhile to watch if you have not already done so.

We voted on the MCCC name modification, with the results being 7 yes, 2 no, and 3 abstentions.

The April meeting will be highlighted by a presentation of the Vizastar spreadsheet for the 128. This should be a meeting you will not want

to miss.

And talking about not missing the meeting, please note that, effective for the April meeting, we will no longer be meeting in the Arlington Community Center on Tuesday night. We are moving to the Stoneridge Home Owners Association Club House, which is situated about four (4) or five (5) blocks north of the Arlington Community Center, off of Center Street. At the Center Street entrance to the Community Center, go North to Grants Parkway and turn east (right). Go down the street and the Club House is on the right side of the road, with Teakwood St. running into it from the north. There is plenty of parking around the side. This is quite a nice place, and we should really enjoy this new location, and of course, we are highly grateful to the association for their community support.

Until next month, be careful.

Mary Louise Hagemeyer

Yes, our meeting date has been changing back and forth, but we had a good turnout in March and welcomed some new and returning members. The chapter unanimously approved changing the club's name to the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club CHA

(MCCC).

Donald

Tate, our librarian, presented some new disks and passed around a writeup he had prepared describing some of the programs and their output. One of them, #741, is for the C128; but Donald found two budget programs on the disk that would run on a C64. The other disks, #539 - 542, may be considered a SID set (music), and 539 is needed in order to use the others.

I showed a BASIC program that lists all possible arrangements of four letters, as an example of nested FOR Next loops. In honor of St. Patrick's Day, we had an "Irish Jig" program with shamrock sprites.

Hank Castello discussed the usefulness of GeoPublish and said that it was very good for small business newsletters and advertising fliers. Hank introduced Bill Jordan, who showed how to use GeoPublish to design a newsletter page complete with headline, graphics, and different type sizes. He pointed out that the job is easier and faster with a RAM expander and said that Berkeley Softworks now sells the expanders.

Our April meeting will be about word processors. If you use one, bring it with you and tell us about its good and bad features. As of this writing we think the meeting will be on the second Saturday, April 14, 1:30 p.m., in the Hulen Library

At the March meeting, several topics were discussed. They were about the DOS Wedge and JiffyDOS. Both were discussed by Jesse Cardin. DOS refers to the Disk Operating System that runs your computer. The C64 DOS Wedge version is located on your demonstration diskette that you got with your disk drive, whether it was for your 1541 or 1571 drive.

To load the C64 version (1541), type the usual "load ' 8" and type "run". This will enable the DOS Wedge system. To load the 128 version, have the demo disk in the drive and let th e program autoboot. The Wedge gives you the capabilities of typing in short commands that would normally take a long time to type. An example is that to get a directory you type, "load "$",8" and type "list". With the Wedge just type '@$' (the @ symbol and dollar sign). To load and run a BASIC program with the Wedge type the up arrow and the name of the program. To load a machine language program just type the percent (%) sign and the name of the program. To save a BASIC program type the back arrow and the name of the program. There are many more symbols for shortening command words such as renaming and scratching files, formatting and validating disks.

JiffyDOS is built into the computer by installing a chip. It has twice the commands as the DOS Wedge, but otherwise it is the same.

The vote was unanimous by the members present at our meeting on the subject of changing the club name from Mid-Cities Commodore Club to the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club. The name change is meant to include all areas of the Fort Worth/Dallas area.

The next meeting will be held on April 21st at the Hurst Recreation Center at 1:30 pm.
