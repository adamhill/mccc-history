## PageStream 2.0

The Best Gets Even Better Amiga Software Review by Bill Raecke

I hardly know where to begin. I've been using PageStream now since March of 1989. I have been a staunch supporter of the software throughout that period. It is true that when first released, the program had several bugs in it that caused the Amiga to crash unexpectedly. Unfortunately the word quickly spread that this was an unreliable piece of software that could not be counted upon even though a free upgrade was furnished about a month after the initial release. At any rate, those days are long gone. PageStream has been a highly reliable product now for quite some time. And now it's gotten even better.

Rather than just concentrate on the new features in this upgrade, I'm going to start back at the beginning and cover some of the basics of desktop publishing for those who may be new to the subject. A desktop publishing program is a program which allows the user to place text and graphics anywhere on a page and then print them out. Controls are provided with which to size the graphics and the text to any proportions desired. This entire newsletter is printed using PageStream. Each page is printed just as it appears here. There is no cutting and pasting except to insert the ads which are provided by our advertisers. With that out of the way, let's talk about a few specifics.

## Text Handling

With any desktop publishing program, the primary consideration is the handling of text. Within that topic there are several sub-topics. We need to know what tools are provided to enter, edit, size and place text on the page; we need to know something about support for typefaces and how they are handled; and we need to know something about the appearance of the typefaces, both on the screen and on the printed page. One at a time, please.

How do you get text into PageStream? There are three basic ways. The first way is to simply select the text tool, pick a typeface and size, click on the spot where you want to start typing, and start typing. The second way is really just a modification of the first. Instead of clicking on a spot and typing, you first open a text block. This is merely a sizable rectangle designed to hold text. Once you have a text block, simply type into it whatever you like. These first two methods are fine for titles and a word here and there, but if you are interested in large amounts of text it is better to do word processing in a program designed for that purpose. You may then IMPORT the text into a text block. PageStream will import text from a standard ASCII file, ProWrite, Scribble, Excellence, or WordPerfect.

Once you have your text in place, you have to be able to edit it. Although the editing tools provided in any desktop publishing program are never as extensive as those found in a good word processor, they aren't bad. Other than the ability to enter and delete text directly, there are tools with which to CUT, COPY, PASTE, DELETE, SEARCH, and REPLACE. What if it's the wrong size? Well, if you entered your text by simply typing onto the page you can simply grab a corner of the text with the mouse pointer and stretch it or shrink it to whatever size looks right. If, on the other hand, you entered text into a text block, pulling a corner will cause the text to flow into the new shape. In this case, in order to size the text itself, you must use a special size requester to pick the size you want. To move it around you simply select the object tool, pick up the block and move it wherever you like. Of course things like snapping to a grid position and entering precise coordinates are provided if desired.

Naturally, text may be right justified, left justified or centered. And if you want justification on both sides, there are three methods provided. Character justification spreads each character on the line apart in order to fill the

Word justification puts the extra space between words. Auto justification puts extra space between each character, but puts most of it between words so that characters don't become too widely spaced. If you want to make text look different you can choose BACKSLANT, BOLD, UNDERLINE, DOUBLE UNDERLINE, ITALICIZE, LIGHT, MIRROR, OUTLINE, REVERSE, SHADOW, STRIKE THROUGH, or UPSIDE DOWN. Or you can choose any combination of those styles.

Text kerning is supported. Kerning is the process of making characters overlap when normal proportional spacing would make them appear too far apart. The AV combination for example must be brought somewhat closer together.

## ont Handling

The handling of typefaces is one of the major improvements in PageStream 2.0 over earlier releases. Notice that I referred to "typefaces" rather than "fonts". That is because PageStream, like other desktop publishing programs, uses scalable fonts which are properly called typefaces. The normal Amiga fonts and

## ...when a program such as PageStream sends its output to a printer it can take advantage of the full resolution that the printer has to offer."

those used by such programs as Excellence are bitmapped fonts. The come in set sizes and a well suited for screen display because every dot in a bitmapped will be displayed as a single pixel on the display screen. This is as good as it gets. When going to a printer, the story changes. A printer - almost any printer - is capable of printing a much higher resolution than can be displayed on a screen. This is what causes the sloppy appearance of the printed word when programs such as Excellence or PenPal are used to print a document. Scalable typefaces such as those used by PageStream or Professional Page do not have preset sizes. They are merely objects which can be mathematically adjusted to whatever size is required. That means that when a program such as PageStream sends its output to a printer it can take advantage of the full resolution that the printer has to offer.

None of this is new. PageStream has used scalable fonts since its inception. What is new is the kind of typefaces which can now be used. Until release 2.0, PageStream used its own proprietary fonts. There were three major pieces to each font. One was a bitmapped display font which was used for screen display, one was a mathematical object which was used when printing to a standard dot-matrix printer, and the third was a postscript definition which was used when a document was to be sent to a postscript device. The same fonts can be used in version 2.0 although the postscript definition is no longer required because PageStream generates it automatically when required. But now, in addition to the PageStream fonts, it is also possible to use AFGA Compugraphic fonts, PostScript Type 1, and PostScript Type 3 fonts. This basically opens up the world because that just about covers all the font types that exist. No other Amiga desktop publishing program can use as many fonts as can the new PageStream.

## Print and Display Quality

Of course it's nice to be able to use every font in the universe, but how do they look? Up 'til now, one of PageStream's big problems was the clarity of the screen display. Because the PageStream proprietary fonts used a bitmapped image and bitmap images did not exist for every possible screen display size, the fonts were rather sloppy when displayed on the screen. That situation has not improved much for those fonts. But now we can use Compugraphic and PostScript fonts as well. When those fonts are displayed on the screen, each character is treated as an object. The resulting image is as close to the printed page as the monitor resolution will allow - just as good as that provided by Professional Page and other programs.

And then there's the print quality. It's no secret that I have been using PixelScript to print the newsletter. It has been set up with PageStream but the output provided by PixelScript has far exceeded that provided by PageStream directly. That is no longer the case. Check out this newsletter. It was produced directly from PageStream. And PageStream has managed this in just a fraction of the processing time which used to be required by PixelScript.

## Graphic Handling

Enough about text already! Let's talk about graphics. There are two types. Line art is object oriented art. We're talking vector graphics and mathematical representations again just as with the scalable fonts. If you have a file created with Aegis' Draw 2000, you can IMPORT it. (There are a couple of other file formats supported but they are not Amiga formats.) There are also a number of built in drawing tools. There are tools provided with which to draw boxes, boxes with rounded corners, horizontal or vertical lines, free-directional lines, circles, ellipses, ares, elliptical arcs, polygons, polylines, bezier curves, and freehand drawing. In short, just about all you could want. Of course, once drawn, an object can be filled with one of forty built-in fill patterns, or you can design your own fill pattern, or you can fill it with any gray scale percentage or color desired. The lines with which the object is drawn can likewise be modified. The thickness can vary - you name it. The line pattern can be solid, invisible, or anything in between (5 patterns are built in or you can design your own). The ends of the lines can be straight, rounded, or arrowhead - and each end of the line may be separately defined. If anything has been left out I can't think of what it might be.

The other type of graphics is bitmapped graphics. These are the standard images that you see on your screen. There are no tools for creating or modifying these in PageStream but you may import them. Lots of bitmapped file formats are recognized. For most of us the only one that matters is the IFF format since that is the Amiga standard - but it is also possible to import graphics from other machines. When importing a bitmapped picture you have two options. Importing it as an object will give you the entire image on the page where it can be sized as desired. Importing it to a picture window will allow you to cut a piece from the picture and place only that piece on the page. It, too, can be sized as desired. The IFF images which can be imported can be any number of bitplanes. If you have a 23 bitplane image from the Sharp scanner, it can be brought in as is and made part of the document. If you are working in black and white this does nothing but absorb large quantities of RAM, but if you are going to do a color separation it will be invaluable. Yes - PageStream does the standard four color separations. It also allows you to specify the screen angle and screen frequency to be used for the printed halftone image.

## Other Neat Stuff

Anything you place in your document becomes an object. These may be bitmapped graphics, text blocks, line objects, or even text that was typed directly into the document without benefit of a text block. There are a number of tools with which to manipulate those objects. They may be repositioned anywhere, of course. But they may also be sized. Or a number of different objects can be grouped together to form a single object. Or you can align them - either one with another or aligned on the page. They may also be rotated. Actually there are three rotation directions called ROTATE, SLANT or TWIST. You can force text to run around any object - even a text block - and you can specify the vertical and horizontal offsets of the runaround. You may also duplicate any object, any number of times, and at any specified horizontal and vertical offset.

When it comes to working on the document there are a multitude of features as well. You can view your document in ANY magnification - from a full page to a variable zoom that's as close as you want it to be. Rulers can be turned on or off - as can the Grid, the Guides, the Tab locations, the Text Routing, Column Outlines and Picture displays. And, of course, you have full control over such things as Measuring System, Grid Size, and just about everything else.

## Summary

I want to do three things to sum up. First I need to briefly review the new features in Pagestream 2.0, particularly since some of them didn't even get mentioned in the review. (That's right. For reasons of space and because if I covered it all this article might have been hailed as a new cure for insomnia, I didn't cover anywhere near all the features.) Second, I need to give some of the bad news. Third, you get to hear my opinion.

First, to the new features. First and foremost are the new font formats that are supported. Associated with that are the improved screen displays and printed output quality. There is a new "bleed area" associated with a document page which allows you to "bleed" text or graphics off the edge of the page. The same area may also be used as a clipboard to hold things as you are working with the page. You may now save Templates and load or append Style Sheets so that you can have a library of forms to make work easier. (This could be done with the old PageStream but the danger existed that you could accidentally save a modified document under the Template name. That can no longer happen.) You can load and save groups of macros which are associated with specific tasks. You can load and save groups of TAGs (text characteristic settings) which are associated with specific tasks. There is a new Bezier Curve tool. There is improved color support. And there are lots of other smaller changes and improvements.

Now for the bad news. The only really bad news is related to some of the good news. All those wonderful new Compugraphic and PostScript fonts are wonderful to look at and improve the display immeasurably. The problem is, all the extra processing slows the program down. This is to be expected. Professional Page has always been slower than PageStream and this is why. Even more important is the way the fonts are handled. With the old PageStream fonts, a font definition was read off the disk and was thereafter kept in memory. With the new fonts, a character at a time is read in from disk. Once in memory, the character does not need to be read in again unless it has been flushed from memory - still, it slows things down somewhat. Again, this is nothing against PageStream - this is how the font technology works. What it means is that if you are going to try to run PageStream on a floppy based system with a standard 68000 processor, you are going to be putting your patience to a good test. I would recommend AT LEAST a harddrive. A faster processor would be nice.

I have only encountered one problem with the program thus far. One of the things that has changed is the file format. There have also been some changes made to the available fonts. When loading a document which was created with PageStream 1.8 and subsequently working with it, the system sometimes crashes. I am not sure which of the changes is causing it but it appears that if I can change the font callouts on the document on the page I am viewing before changing pages that the problem goes away. The moral is to upgrade your documents as soon as possible. I have experienced no problems whatsoever when working with documents created directly in PageStream 2.0.

At last - my recommendation. There are three major desktop publishing contenders in the Amiga market: PageStream, Professional Page, and Saxon Publisher. I don't own either Professional Page or Saxon Publisher, so I am no expert, but I have looked at them at local dealers. I have seen no reason to prefer them over PageStream. In fact PageStream still has many features that the competition doesn't have. And since PageStream costs about half, that should settle things. At least it does for me. I recommend it wholeheartedly.

## Wings

A Terrific New Action Game From Cinemaware Amiga Software Review by Harold Williams

Cinemaware's newest release, Wings, is not a flight simulator. Wings is a game! No pilot's license required. The game begins in 1916 and continues through the end of World War I. Wings features 2D and 3D arcade action mixed with a role playing experience.

Wings comes on two disks and requires 1 meg of memory. The manual provides complete instructions for playing the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive. Instructions for hard disk installation are included on the disk along with a utility to perform the installation. (The installation script attempts to create a directory named RAM:T and then ASSIGN T: to the directory. This will fail on most Amigas because T: will already exist as RAM:T. There are two solutions: 1) edit the script, or 2) remove T: by using the commands "ASSIGN T:" and "DELETE RAM:T".) Wings uses word lookup copy protection.

The game begins in flight school. Enter flight school by selecting a name for your pilot. Wings will then require you to set your pilots abilities in four areas - flying ability, shooting ability, mechanical aptitude, and stamina. These abilities will change throughout the game. Good performance in combat will increase your characteristics. Failures will cause your characteristics to decrease. Flight school provides a brief preview of the types of missions that will occur once you join a squadron.

Once you complete flight school (this is very easy to do) you join a squadron and begin flying combat missions. There are three basic types of missions with many variations within each type. Aerial combat missions consist mainly of the classic dogfight. Usually several other members of the squadron fly with you. These missions may also require you to shoot down enemy surveillance balloons, escort an Allied bomber, protect an Allied base from attack or protect Allied surveillance balloons. You may encounter as many as 10 enemy aircraft on one of these missions. If the mission takes place over enemy territory there will also be anti-aircraft guns to contend with. The perspective for the aerial combat missions is from directly behind the pilot. You really get the feel of flying the plane. Strafing missions use a different perspective. You look down on the plane from above and fly diagonally across the screen (something like the old Zaxxon concept). You fly alone on these missions. Strafing targets consist of convoys, infantry, trains, etc. The primary danger in this type of mission is the groundfire from infantry and anti-aircraft guns. A third mission type is the bombing run. Again the perspective changes. The bombing run is a 2D sequence. The view is from directly above the plane. Bombing targets consist of bases, aerodromes, trains, and submarines. Anti-aircraft fire is the primary danger for these missions. All missions increase in difficulty level as the war continues. Playing the game to the completion of WWI involves over 230 missions.

Wings maintains data for only one active pilot. If your pilot dies, you go back to flight school and select another pilot. When he completes flight school he joins the squadron. Many pilots will be required to complete all the missions. Pilots can be promoted as high as Lt. Colonel (you join the squadron as a 2nd Lieutenant). Pilots also may be awarded as many as five different medals. Your pilot will always be given the job of maintaining the squadron journal. Through this journal (it is really written by the computer) you are given a unique perspective of WWI.

Because Wings maintains only one set of pilot data, it is a little tricky if more than one person wants to play the game.

pilot.dat.keith. When I play I copy the "harold" file to "REEL 2/pilot.dat", and when my son plays he copies the "keith" file. At the end of playing we then have to be sure to save our progress by copying pilot. dat back to our personal data file.

If you play from floppies it is really no problem, just keep separate copies of the game for each player. But if you install Wings on a hard drive you will have to do a little work to allow for multiple players. You can find the pilot data in a directory named "REEL 2". The file is named "pilot.dat". All you have to do is keep a copy of the file for each player. I currently have two files named pilot.dat.harold and

Wings is a terrific game. I highly recommend it. The action, graphics, music, sound and gameplay are far better than I can describe in this article. So, don't just sit there reading this article. Sprint down to your nearest Amiga dealer and buy Wings!

## The A2232 Serial Card

One Card - Seven Ports - From Commodore Amiga Review by Ned Kelly

I recently acquired Commodore's A2232 multiport serial card for my Amiga 2000. The product consists of one board with seven mini-DIN plugs on the back, seven miniDIN to DB25 serial cables, one disk of installation software, and manual.

The hardware installation was very straightforward. There are seven jumpers on the board, one for each port, which allow for the swapping of the transmit and receive signals which normally appear on pins 2 and 3 respectively. After deciding on the jumper configuration, which I left alone, it was just a matter of plugging it in to an empty slot in the 2000. The instructions said to secure the A2232 card to the back of the Amiga using the screw that held the slot cover in place. This seems to be a standard practice which I like, but unfortunately the A2232 card does not have the necessary bracket with which to do this.

The software installation was equally straightforward. The manual describes both an icon driven and a Cuil approach to the software installation. On the disk is an updated AmigaTerm communications package, and several pieces of system software. The 7 serial ports on the card are referenced as SER2 through SER8 allowing for the built in serial port, SERO, and for one internal serial port, SER1. There is a new Preferences which will allow you to manipulate the settings for the 7 ports. There is a new Mount command for the C directory and a new serial. device for the DEVS directory. There is also an example of a new Mountlist because the extra ports must be included in your Mountlist to use them from AmigaDOS. And finally there is a new Port-Handler and Aux-Handler for the L directory.

My first use for the multiple port capability was to eliminate the A/B switch I had been using for the two serial devices I currently have. I use a communications package other than AmigaTerm and it was not clear how to make my communications package use anything other than SERO. So I left it on SERO. The other device I have is an X-10 PowerHouse home controller for turning lights on and off around the house. The software I was using was some I had written myself in C so I decided to connect this device to port SER2. The manual has examples of programming multiple ports in C so I had confidence that I could modify this to work on port SER2. I originally wrote the software in C because the X-10 device communicates at a speed of 600 baud which was not supported by Preferences and I needed access to the serial device routines to communicate at that rate. However, a ReadMe file on the installation disk talked about how the new Mount command allowed for overriding the default settings on the serial ports when the device was opened. For example a reference to "SER4:2400/7E2" specifies that serial port 4 is to be opened for communication at 2400 baud, 7 bits, even parity, and 2 stop bits. With this in mind I rewrote the software in Fortran with no problems.

The manual states that MIDI devices must be connected to the built in serial port since the A2232 does not support the MIDI baud rate. However, the ReadMe file on the installation disk states that it supports baud rates of 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, and 115200. I seem to recall that MIDI lies somewhere between 19200 and 115200 so I am not sure why the manual says that it will not support MIDI. I am very pleased with the multiport serial card and would recommend it to anyone who is tired of having to switch the serial port between multiple devices. I have some other uses in mind for the remaining 6 ports on the A2232 board so be on the lookout for another article in this series.

## DJHelper

Getting Your DeskJet To Do What You Want Amiga Software Review by Bill Raecke

## Why DoHelper?

First a brief explanation of why those of us with Hewlett Packard DeskJet printers are looking for new tools. The DeskJet is a wonderful machine. It has the capability to add different fonts which you may purchase in cartridge form and plug in to the DeskJet. If you purchase a RAIM expansion cartridge you may download fonts to the DeskJet and use those. Unfortunately, Preferences does not allow any way to access those capabilities directly from the Amiga. If you are using a font cartridge you may select the desired font from the DeskJet's panel, but when the printer device is loaded and activated from disk, the first thing that happens is that the printer is reset. If you are working with downloaded fonts, there is no direct support provided either for the download activity or for selection of the desired font. Frustration.

On the other side of the coin, the DeskJet has one problem. When printing graphics, the pictures turn out very dark and muddy. The reason for this is that, although the DeskJet is able to address 300 dpi (dots per inch) in graphics mode, when the ink hits the paper the dots spread slightly so that they run together a little. The result is that for all practical purposes the darkest gray shades are black and the entire picture is darker than it should be. This can be corrected, of course, by taking a picture into a paint program or an image processing program such as the Art Department and adjusting the color map to lighten it for printing. This is the method I use when preparing something for printing in the newsletter and it is quite effective and very quick once you've done it a few times. Still, it leaves me with the feeling that for some purposes there should be a simpler way.

## What You Get

So what is DJHelper? It is a new product produced by Creative Focus to allow you to overcome all the problems I just mentioned - and more. It really consists of a couple of parts. First you get a new print driver called DJH\_Driver. Second you get the program DJHelper itself. DJHelper can be thought of as a second Preferences program. (It is really more than that but just think of it like that for now.) When you access a print function the printer. device is activated, the DJH Driver is called, and the Preference settings are checked. Then the DJHelper settings are checked to make final adjustments before sending the output to the printer. It is this tie-in to normal print functions that makes the program as powerful and easy to use as it is.

When you buy DJHelper, the first thing you get to do is exercise your DeskJet a little. There is no printed manual. Instead there is a file on the disk that is designed to be sent directly to the PAR: device. The manual is forty-six pages long. This is not a major problem unless you happen to run out of ink while the print is in process. There is no easy way to start in the middle of the file since many of the control codes to initialize the printer are at the beginning. I mention it because it happened to me.

The DJHelper program consists of four major sections. When you start the program it comes up on the PAGE screen. Across the top of the screen are four buttons - one for each major function of the program: PAGE, FONT, GRFX, and XMIT. By clicking on the desired button it appears depressed and you are taken to the appropriate screen. Those same four buttons appear in each of DJHelper's four screens. Also constant on each screen are the SAVE, USE, and EXIT buttons. They correspond to the Preferences buttons which can SAVE the settings as a default for future printer actions or simply USE them for the current session.

The PAGE screen corresponds roughly to the text printer setting screen of Preferences. It should also be noted that all the settings on this screen supersede those made in Preferences. The reason for this is that DJHelper allows you much more control than Preferences can over such things as page length because it was designed specifically for use with the DeskJet. There are a lot more things you can now control. For example, Preferences allows you to specify LENGTH. With DJHelper you may specify TOP MARGIN, TEXT LENGTH, and PAGE LENGTH for much better control of your output. The DeskJet also has a special TEXT SCALE function. It is necessary because the DeskJet is incapable of printing within 1/2 inch of the edges of the paper. That means that it cannot print the normal 66 lines on a standard page unless, of course, you turn on TEXT SCALE. This scrunches everything down just enough so that 66 lines will print in the accessible areas of the page. DJHelper allows you to turn this feature on or off at will. LINE WRAP can be turned on or off. PERF SKIP and AUTO FF (Form Feed) and be turned on or off. ORIENTATION can be set to either Portrait or Landscape. (The DeskJet Plus has built in landscape fonts which can now be accessed directly.) The DIRECTION of print can be set to either Left, Right, or Both. (Left or Right settings are slower but more accurate, as with most other printers.)

The FONT screen allows selection of the desired font. The built in font on the DeskJet is Courier. Everyone has it. With this font you may control the PITCH (number of characters per inch) and Point (height in 72nds of an inch). Of course you must work within the constraints of the font you are using. You may also tell DJHelper about any font cartridges you have installed by simply clicking on INSTALL, clicking on the TYPEFACE button and

scanning though the list of available cartridges until you see yours. Then simply click on the name of the cartridge, click on TYPEFACE and click on INSTALL once more and you are set. Click on SAVE and DJHelper will remember it the next time. And then all you will need to do to use that font is to select it from the TYPEFACE section. The FONT screen also provides a way to download fonts to the DeskJet. Enter the name of the device and drawer containing the font, click on the file name of the font to be downloaded and then click on the DOWNLOAD button. The font will be sent to the DeskJet along with all the appropriate commands to set it up, and at the same time it is added to the TYPEFACE selection box. The other major function that the FONT screen provides is the conversion of LaserJet fonts to DeskJet fonts. Enter a

## "Across the top of the screen are four buttons - one for each major function of the program: PAGE, FONT, GRFX, and XMIT."

drawer and file name to convert, enter a drawer and filename for the converted font, and click on the CONVERT button. It doesn't get too much easier.

The XMIT screen is very technical in nature and will probably seldom be used by most people. First, it allows binary editing of files. In other words you can manipulate a print file before sending it to the printer - perhaps to add some necessary printer setup commands. Second, you can write your own printer driver so that certain codes will result in certain different codes being sent to the printer. The uses for this are, at best, obscure.

The GRFX screen is where control is provided over graphic dumps. The functions provided on this screen work with those in Preferences rather than superseding them as was the case on the PAGE screen. The major function of the GRFX screen is to control the darkness or lightness of the printed image. Each of the sixteen possible gray tones is individually adjustable. And there are buttons for a LINEAR map (same as the standard DeskJet driver provided by Commodore), a TEMPER map (recommended settings), an INVERT map (a negative image), and a USER'S map which can be set and stored with the other program defaults. This is not the only function provided however. You may also indicate whether to use compressed graphic information (greatly speeds printing) and you may accurately locate an image anywhere on the page in terms of Dots (300 per inch), Decipoints (720 per inch), or Row and Column position.

## What You Don't Get

program. It allows access to functions that simply have not been available before through the standard Preferences settings. It is not without its flaws, however and now it is time to explore them.

just the way you want it. Nothing is left out. Or is there? If you think of the program as you do Preferences everything is fine. You make changes to your settings, save them as defaults, and from then on everything works as expected. The problem is, a program this powerful is inviting you to change settings on the fly and use whatever settings are appropriate for the particular file you are currently working with. That being the case, why didn't Creative Focus provide a simple file requester and a means to send that file to the printer. Making the changes in DJHelper and then switching over to the CLI to type the command "Copy filename to PRT:" is clumsy and unnecessary. A few lines of code would have made it a lot easier to live with. Or at least provide an ARexx port so the feature could be provided by the user of the product.

The FONT screen has its share of problems as well. The file requester used to select fonts to be downloaded or converted is extremely primitive. There is no way to bring up a list of available devices from which to make a selection - the device name must be typed in. To select a file, you must first click in a box to put the file name in an unnecessary and annoying step. This is not the way Amiga programs are normally written. As for the font conversion process, I gave it a try with about 8 different public domain fonts that I downloaded from one of the major networks. They were all proportional fonts but all of the converted fonts were incorrectly spaced when printed which rendered them ugly and unusable. In all fairness I must say that I have not seen any of these printed on a LaserJet so I cannot say for sure that the problem was in the conversion process - they may have been ugly to start with.

That brings us to the GRFX screen. I have no complaint with what it does - just an observation. I have found it much more effective to adjust the color palette with an image processing program (The Art Department) than to allow corrections to be done with DJHelper. It helps me to be able to see the image and the effects my changes are making before I commit to print. This may be just personal preference and certainly is not a complaint.

## The Verdict

You decide. If you have a DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, or the new DeskJet 500 and have found yourself frustrated by some of the things you cannot do, by all means buy this product. I find myself more frustrated by the things DJHelper cannot do rather than what it does. The omission of a file print capability is a major annoyance. The inclusion of that capability OR and ARexx port so I could solve the problem myself would make the program a lot better. Alternately, and probably even better, would be a way to control DJHelper without using the Intuition interface at all. In other words I would like to be able to call DJHelper with a set of parameters and have it change the settings on the fly without having to look at it. In this way I could make it part of my own print utility.

The PAGE screen allows you to set up the text page

As I said, you decide. It is a terrific product. My complaints are mostly personal preferences and may even be fixed in future releases. Maybe I need to send a copy of this review to Creative Focus.?

## The SuperDisks

Library Information From Harold Williams

This is the third article in a series of articles describing the MCCC SuperDisk Collection. This month I will describe the second of the three WorkBench/CLI utility collections. SD-WBUtil2 contains 12 utilities that will i sited that wit enhance your Amiga WorkBench and CLI. Bach program comes with complete instructions.

ARTM (Amiga Real Time Monitor) displays all sorts of information about the current activity in your Amiga. Tasks, windows, libraries, devices, resources, ports, residents, interrupts, and vectors can be monitored. ARTM also provides information about available memory, devices, assigns, fonts, and installed hardware.

DMouse is a bundle of useful utilities. It provides screen blanking, pointer blanking, auto-window activation, window to front, window to back, mouse acceleration, and pop-cli all in one program. All of DMouse's features are configurable.

Mackie is simply the slickest screen blanker available. After a period of inactivity (the time is adjustable), Mackie blanks the screen and begins an incredibly beautiful display of line art. You just have to see Mackie - it can't be described. Mackie also includes configurable hot keys.

MakeFastMem solves a strange problem that occurred when Commodore upgraded the Agnes chip to allow for one megabyte of chip RAM. Some software had been written with the built-in assumption that any RAM beyond 512K would not be chip memory. These software packages just don't understand machines with one megabyte of memory but no fast memory. This utility will "convert" some chip RAM to fast RAM and allow these programs to run.

MuchMore is a replacement for the WorkBench More utility. MuchMore will read a text file and smooth scroll the text up and down depending on mouse movement.

RunBack will run a program in the background, thus freeing the CLI from which it was spawned. RunBack includes the NULL: device. The NULL: device is similar to NIL:, but behaves like a real device. Both of these, RunBack and NULL:, are "must have" utilities.

Setfont will let you select different system fonts. The fonts used in screen titles, window titles, and menus can be individually selected.

SID is a "directory utility". SID will simplify the process of copying, moving, creating, and deleting files and directories. SID also can be used to create and dissolve archives in the ARC, ZOO, LZH, PAK and WARP formats. SID will automatically display pictures and play sounds using your favorite display and sound programs. Text files (and Word Perfect) files can be read with a simple mouse click. SID has dozens of other terrific features but a complete description is beyond the scope of this article. SID is probably the best piece of freely distributable (shareware) software you will ever lay your hands on. This utility is absolutely indispensable.

SimGen displays a 2 or 4 color picture "behind" your WorkBench. This can produce some remarkable effects. If you've grown tired of a plain single color background this program will really change the look of your Amiga. Several pictures are included, but any IFF picture can be used.

Snap is a cut and paste utility. Using Snap you can capture text from any screen. The captured text can then be pasted into any document. Snap can also cut and paste graphics.

Time displays the time in a tiny window. This is an incredibly small program, using only 484 bytes. The window does have a drag bar and close gadget.

With allows a command to be executed on multiple files. This can really simplify some CLI tasks. The command "WITH DFO:* DOC TYPE TO AlIDocs" will type all files found on DFO: that end with doc to a file named AllDocs. If you are a CLI user, With can become addicting.

Okay, that concludes our tour of SD-WBUtil2. There is still a third WorkBench/CLI utility SuperDisk. SDWBUtil3 will be discussed in next month's installment of the SuperDisk articles.

## Amiga Library News

Public Domain and Shareware Picks From Bill Raecke

CLASSIX2, and AMIGADEUS.

Fastlet by Charles Tyson

"FastJet is a graphics compressor for the Hewlett Packard DeskJet and DeskJet Plus." Those words are from the doc file that accompanies the program. What's it mean? Most programs send a pixel-by-pixel representation of the graphic image to the DeskJet. This means that a page of data will take over 800,000 bytes to be sent. Transferring this large amount of data through the parallel port is where most of the time is taken up when printing an image. But the DeskJet also has a compressed graphics mode that can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be provided to the Desket. Using Fastet can have a tremendous impact on printing times, particularly when large the page contains significant white space. Even on a normal page the results are impressive. As a test, I took the first page from the September MCCC News. Printing the page directly to the printer to 7 minutes and 10 seconds. By redirecting the output through fastiet, the printing time was reduced to 6 minutes and 43 seconds.

So how do you use it? You must be able to redirect your printed output to a file. With PageStream this is easy since it is part of the Printer Configuration setup. Then you simply execute the command "FastJet filename".

## Lusic from Rob Baxter

If you are interested in seeing just how good music generated on the Amiga can be, here is your opportunity. Rob Baxter has obviously spent many hours designing special instruments and scoring these pieces with great care. All the scores have been done in Sonix. This is great news because Sonix has a public domain player (included with the music) that multitasks beautifully so that you can have the music going in the background while you do other things. (Just as the music is playing right now as I write this article.) The instruments were designed with Sonix and with Synthia. The results of Rob's work are astounding. There are four of Rob's disks being added to the library this month. Each is full of music and each is set up so that it may be booted (if you are not worried about multitasking) or you can click on an icon to start it up.

PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION was composed by Mussorgsky in 1874 in memory of his friend, painter and architect Victor Hartmann. Each piece within the work represents an impression of one of Hartmann's works. The entire work takes up two full disks and you should be sure to get them both to enjoy it all.

Queen of Sheba", "Badinerie" and "Air" by J. S. Bach, "Allegro Deciso" from Handel's "Water Music", the "Gavotte" by Bach, Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto no. 5" , and finally Pachelbel's "Canon and Gigue"

CLASSIX2 is a collection of some of the more popular Baroque pieces. If you select the "play all" option on the disk, this is what you will hear. Handel's "Arrival of the

AMIGADEUS is a sample two pieces selected from the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Included are "A Little Night Music" and the Rondo from the Fourth Horn Concerto.

By now some of you may be put off by the fact that this is all "Classical Stuff". Don't let that stop you. This is all very listenable and it is simply some of the best sounding music you will find for the Amiga. If you run it through a stereo as I do, visitors will have a difficult time believing that it is being generated on a computer. These will not be on MCCC disks, but can be found on disks named by Rob Baxter. Ask for PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION Disks 1 and 2,

The problem with doing it this way of course

![Image](1990_10_artifacts/image_000007_21831decd374adefd00948fd414d70f5f990ff9939fa9214872862110d90b80c.png)

is that you are taking up time to write the file to disk. There is an even better way. Ever wonder what the PIPE: device was for? First mount PIPE:. Then execute the command "Run FastJet PIPE:a -c". The filename here is PIPE:a. The "-c" qualifier means print this file continuously. Then redirect your printer output to the file "PIPE:a". The FastJet program will process the file on the fly without it ever having to be stored on disk. When the print is complete, fastjet will stop but it will remain in memory waiting for the next file called "PIPE:a" to appear. Neat.

This is the method I used to generate the timing test above.

If you have a Deskiet you need this program. It has been released as freely distributable copyrighted software. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_215.

## A Light In The Dark

New Research Results From the A.B.A.C.U.S. Script, Bakersfield, CA

I or years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted light. However, recent information from Bell Labs has proven otherwise. Electric bulbs don't emit light, they suck dark. Thus they now call these bulbs dark suckers. The dark sucker theory, according to a Bell Labs spokesperson, proves the existence of dark, that dark has mass heavier than that of light, and that dark is faster than light.

The basis of the dark sucker theory is that electric bulbs suck dark. Take, for example, the dark suckers in because the heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake or ocean and the lighter light floats to the top.

The immense power of dark can be utilized to man's advantage. We can collect the dark that has settled to the bottom of the lakes and push it through turbines which generates electricity and helps push dark to the ocean, where it is safely stored.

In conclusion, Bell Labs stated that dark suckers make all our lives much easier. So the next time you look at an electric bulb, remember that it is indeed a dark sucker.

the room where you are. There is less dark right next to them than there is elsewhere. The larger the dark sucker the greater its capacity to suck dark. Dark suckers in a parking lot have a much greater capacity than the ones in this room. As with all things, dark suckers don't last forever. Once they are full of dark, they can no longer suck. This is proven by the black spot on a full dark sucker. A candle is a primitive dark sucker. A new candle has a white wick. You will notice after the first use the wick turns black, representing all the dark which has been sucked into it. If you hold a pencil next to the wick of an operating candle, the tip will turn black because it got in the way of the dark flowing into the candle.

Unfortunately, these primitive dark suckers have a very limited range. There are also portable dark suckers. The bulbs in these can't handle all of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by a dark storage unit. When the dark storage unit is full, it must either be emptied or replaced before the portable dark sucker can operate again.

Dark has mass. When dark goes into a dark sucker, friction from this mass generates heat. Thus, it is not wise to touch an operating dark sucker. Candles present a special problem, as the dark must travel in the solid wick instead of through glass. Thus, it can be very dangerous to touch an operating candle.

Dark is also heavier than light. If you swim deeper and deeper and deeper, you notice it gets darker and darker. When you reach a depth of approximately fifty feet, you are in the total darkness. This is

We had a pretty quick retirement of our last shareware program. The money was mailed and we now have a new program to support. Console Buffer is a user configurable buffer for your CLI that allows you to review those things that seem to scroll so quickly off your screen. A handy scroll gadget is attached to your CLI allowing you to see any part of the buffer using the mouse or keyboard. Very nice. Bring a buck to the next meeting and help us support this handy product.

Our presentation was made by Ray Howard, vice president of the Amiga Central chapter. Ray showed us some of the basic uses for A Rexx, a language se d in mainly the A mig a environment for sending commands to other processes but that stands alone as a

Fall Has Fell! Our September meeting began simultaneously with a sudden downpour. Did a little thunder keep some of you home, or was it just the first meeting after the start of school? Anyhow, there were almost as many folks as usual, but we were spread out more... same room as before, just extended back into the next meeting area. Very comfortable, room for all... y'all come back, now!

Bits and bytes: We shared an article about how Virginia Tech has dropped all of its Macintoshes for A3000's, and is testing UNIX. Each incoming freshman Computer Science major has to buy a system (with a 100mb hard disk, 5mb RAM), and no other manufacturer came close to their requirements for capabilities and price. Wow!

Our ShareWare spotlight this month was Console Buffer ("CB"), a utility that simulates a 400inch monitor by capturing whatever rolls by for you to scroll through later. (Ours is set for 10,000 lines... thus the 400"-high window, heehee.) How often has

Contributions to the author are invited, just stuff 'em in the labeled jar at the meeting. By the way, you might spend a few minutes browsing through the library listings next month... amazing stuff we have available, all for the price of a blank disk!

Our Software Demo was the Disney Animation Studio, presented by Forrest McKinney. This package was created by Disney Software, which has a few other items out (like "Ducktales"), but is a young company which seems to still have a few bugs. On the positive side, their unique 3stage design helps you do good animation the "old-fashioned way", one frame at a time. First you "pencil in" your basic character to be animated. Then you can use their amazing "onion skin" feature to see the previous 3 frames of the sequence in various gray-scale shades, to guide you in your next frame. Next step is

to add color, and the Studio contains a system with many (but not all) of the features of Deluxe Paint to fill in your design. You can then lock in the animation colors and create/add backgrounds with a separate palette. For finishing touches, there is a library of sounds you can link with the frames (it supports Sonix files!). The package includes some classic

Disney characters and images which you can practice with and learn from but NOT save, print, etc., as the y a r e copyrighted. The manual, which we were told had lots of errors and even missing pages, teaches not only the use of the software but the art of animation... professional tricks and terms of the trade, shortcuts, how to make inanimate objects come of its new animation products, but THEIR software sells for $50,000. If that's out of your budget, the Disney Animation Studio lists for $175, and bugs or not, that's a good deal!

Our next meeting will be after METCOM, on Wednesday October 17th, 7:30 p.m. in our new, expanded room at the Richardson Civic Center. We'll see a demo of "Sketchmaster"

As our September meeting fell very early in the month this time, most of us had not received our copy of last month's newsletter, and I still have not. Hope we don't have a goof up and fail to get them at all.

We had planned to have a program centered around the modem this time, but discovered to our regret that we had a dead line on the

phone, and being Saturday, we had no way of working it out. John Sookma had the Quantum Link demo loaded and we were able to view and comment on it.

Okley Moss was visiting with us and gave us information about our own BBS for the benefit of new members who were not subscribers. We had one man from Glenrose (John Gore) meeting with us for the first time. It seems we are the closest Commodore Club available to him. We were recommended to him by a computer retail source.

We had a brief discussion about METCOM and the Flea Market coming 10/13/90. Good time to get rid of excess hardware and/or software - or to pick up same if you can use it.

Donald Tate, our chapter librarian, brought to our attention 4 more disk numbers - #550 &amp; #551 containing, among other programs, several terminals and a check table; also #552 &amp; #553 - game disks with a version of Monopoly, Rush Hour, etc.

It was decided to begin again our previous custom of having various volunteers take a library disk to review and make a report on. Response was good - this seems to be the best way to become familiar with our library contents without having to spend so much time searching.

Herschel Gibbs talked about SID music he had written a n d recommended - for those interested in doing their - a combination disk and book called Enhanced SID player.

At the September 9th meeting, METCOM 90 was discussed. This will be held at the Arlington Convention Center on October 13th. Anyone looking for certain software or hardware can have a good chance of finding it at METCOM.

Brad Dumler from the Arlington/Grand Prairie Chapter came to our meeting and did a very informative review of Big Blue Reader (BBR) 64/128. BBR translates text from an IBM PC (or equivalent) to a Commodore 64 or 128 and back. This does not mean, however, that BBR can emulate a PC. Text (or data) in ASCII format can transfer easily. The program runs better with two 5 1/4" drives (preferably 1571 or 1581). If you have a RAM drive it can be used as an extra buffer. There is a file utility program that is included in the package. BBR can be purchased for $28 at Software Support. This is a company in Washington (state) and you need to contact Brad or me for more information.

It was decided by the members present that there will not be an October meeting. The November meeting will be held on the 17th and elections for the new year will be taking place at that time.

The METCOM 90 show will be October 13th, all day and has no admission charge.

CHAPTER

and still not bore the videophiles. Over at the club booth, MCCC VidSIG member Darrell Simmonds will make available video digitizing and great color hardcopy.

What Dewayne and Jack plan to show at METCOM 90 is the process of preparing a multimedia video production that results in a fast moving, interesting video program live. The program is in two parts: The first segment will feature multimedia S-Video tape editing and the second part will feature multimedia presentation. Quality is what were aiming for. Not only from an interest standpoint but from the ability to create video master tapes which can be used for third generation copies with good results.

Just how they proceed and how the equipment is being used is what we will be learning. The key to integrating the multimedia editing and presentation will be the Amiga used as the main system controllers. So, instead of expensive editing controller hardware being wired to the various video sources (Hi-8 and Super VHS cameras, VCR's, special effects generators (SEGs), computer graphics, scrolling credits via genlock, audio, SIGGRAPH tape, etc.) the Amiga will act as assembly editor using an infra-red beacon to cue the equipment. The specialized Amiga software to be used is called Media Processor by Interactive Microsystems of Haverhill, Massachusetts. The presentation part of the program will show the tape just made and get into the discussion of equipment and software used. Another feature that I will be on the lookout for is making hardcopy from the video frames. We will be able to grab and save images from cameras, tapes or computer for subsequent integration into a page like this one. If you like what you see going on at VidSIG find out about joining in the VidSIG workshop.
