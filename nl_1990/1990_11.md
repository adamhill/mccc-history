## A Mouse With No Tail

Hardware Review by Johnny C. Kitchens

Lt you haven't noticed, the mouse has become such a part of the computer it's hard to imagine certain computer operations without it. Their connection with each other has become the way to think of computers. There have been several devices which have attempted to make inroads on the mouse's monopoly. Trackballs, light pens, and touch screens are a few that come to mind. None of these have the convenience of the mouse, though there are arguments in favor of each.

If the mouse has a fault it is the free space needed for the mouse to move about. It is this space that causes the problem. The mouse must move about in order to perform its intended function. To further complicate this problem is the cord which connects the the mouse and computer. The cord not only gets in the way, but provides a measure of drag for the mouse. These features are only a problem to a few or may only make themselves noticeable at some inconvenient moment. Have you ever had the cord become wound up? It's like the phone cord. You eventually have to do an unwind. Cordless phones don't have the problem, and neither does the cordless mouse. Yes, there is a mouse with no tail, and here is a look at it.

A cordless mouse cannot be considered a radical departure from what you are familiar with. The shape and operation are very similar to the mouse we know already. The difference lies in the lack of a cord on the mouse. There is a cord in the box with the mouse, but it's connected to a box that looks like half a mouse. This half mouse is the receiver for the infrared signals that the mouse uses to communicate with. Infrared signals are very common in a lot of homes in this day and time. Remote controls for most electronic equipment use infrared signals to get the message across. I have four such controllers and now a mouse sending infrared signals about the room. What's amazing about this is that not one single one of these interfere with the others' intended target.

The creator of the cordless mouse, Practical Solutions, has definitely given us something different while still offering something familiar. Does it work? Read on and decide.

My first surprise came when I opened the box. There were three buttons on top. Pictures and the one I had previously examined had only two on top. Getting something extra is always great. Rumor has it that the third button will be needed in the future, but as of now it's useless. The second thing to catch my attention was no batteries. It was late at night before I could try out this new mouse, and no batteries. Yes, it does say "Batteries Not Included" on the box. Yes, there is a reason for all night convenience stores. It takes two AAA batteries, which I found on my first try. Strangely enough the boxes still say the same thing about batteries on the latest cordless wonders arriving in the stores, but strangely enough the batteries are right there in the box. Oh well, I rarely win anyway.

Set-up was the next thing to tackle. A new problem to tackle with this new mouse is where to put the receiver. The further the receiver sits from the mouse the less critical the accuracy needed for the mouse to point at the receiver. There is a piece of two sided tape for the purpose of affixing the receiver in a convenient location. I decided on a different set-up. I decided that the main advantage of this mouse was ease of location. Need to put the mouse in a more accessible location - just move it. The problem is that the receiver may be in the location, and if anything gets in between the mouse and receiver it won't work. So I decided to put velcro on the receiver, then I scrounged up some angled piece of aluminum. I attached velcro to two parts of the angle and another piece to the wall. I can now attach the angle to the wall behind my computer, and attach the receiver to the angle. Although I have yet to

## The New Skyline

Bill Raecke

I have been asked by a number of people how the new skyline on the cover of the newsletter was done. So, in case there are others still wondering, here it is. The first and most difficult step was getting the pictures of the skylines. I went out one Sunday afternoon to shoot the pictures. Fort Worth was easy - there's a big hill off Interstate 30 just east of the city that makes a perfect vantage point. Dallas wasn't so easy. I tried to get a shot comparable to the one of Fort Worth but there was no place to stand to take the picture. The only good shots I could find were from highways where there was not even a shoulder to pull off on. I took a few shots of parts of the city that I figured could be pasted together later but they were far from optimum. On my way home I kept looking for something better. I finally found the vantage point I needed several miles west of Dallas - again on Interstate

need to, I can, whenever I want, move the receiver for a new position of the mouse. Now with everything set up as I wanted, let's see how well it works.

This mouse has a new feel. It truly moves more freely. The teflon pads it rides on are truly smoother than other materials used. I used the program ClockDJ to adjust mouse speed to compensate for the difference. Any operation of the mouse causes a LED to blink in the receiver. It is not distracting for me - you have to look right at it to notice the blinking. Another thing to get used to is the hidden button on the side. This is the power button. It falls naturally for either left or right handed use. This button is important as the mouse turns itself off after 10 minutes of disuse to conserve battery power. Moving the mouse and not getting a response can be shocking at first, but after a few times, clicking the button becomes natural. Battery life for me was five weeks for the first set and 4 weeks for the second. When battery failure comes the mouse becomes difficult to use - taking forever to move across the screen or refusing to select menus. After the second set it occurred to me that rechargable batteries are a natural. Buying a set of fast charging nicads that recharge in a hour would be the way. Five months later the nicads are still going strong. They can go up to three weeks without a charge. I usually

30. I had to shoot using a telephoto lens but at least I got the city in a single picture.

The next step was digitizing the pictures. For that I have to thank Amazing Computer Systems. I drove over to the Amazing store in Fort Worth one evening and they were kind enough to let me use the Sharp JX-100 scanner that was on display. For those who have not been introduced to this piece of equipment yet, check it out. It scans an image at 200 dpi, it is easy to use, and the resulting digitized pictures are of an excellent quality. It will scan in either eight bit gray scale or 23 bit color. I scanned the photographs with the 23 bit option so I could have as much detail as possible to work with.

The last step was manipulating the images to get the brightness and contrast correct for printing and to bring out as much detail as I could. You see, when I took the pictures it was an overcast day - in fact there was even a very light rain in Dallas. As you remember, the picture I took of Dallas was from several miles away. That means that the picture was a very poor quality. Sounds like a job for The Art Department. I pulled the 23 bit color images into The Art Department and brought out as much detail as I could. Then I converted them to an eight bit gray scale (just the push of a button with The Art Department) and played with the brightness and contrast some more until it appeared to be what I wanted. Of course the acid test is what it looks like printed out. To test that I had to pull the pictures into PageStream and give them a try.

→ Page 7

charge them overnight on the weekend just to be sure.

I've noticed just one problem in operation. Apparently the left button signal stays on just a little too long. Pushing the button to make a selection of a file on SID, for instance, and then quickly moving the mouse may get you two selections. This happens so rarely that it is only an annoyance.

All I can say is that once you've become used to the feeling of the cordless mouse you will never go back. I had a 1000 when I began using the cordless and now it resides next to my 2500. The mouse that came with the 2500 has never been taken out of the package.

I have just two suggestions for Practical Solutions in the future. Make rechargable batteries standard and user replaceable - I hate rechargable batteries that the user can't replace - and make a holder that the mouse can be placed into that will recharge the batteries, just like cordless phones.

Well, if your mouse is getting a little sick and you are considering a replacement, take a look at the cordless mouse. It's not a gimmick. It does work. It costs roughly about twice the price of a regular mouse, but what the heck. You get twice as many buttons to push, but you do lose the cord. Win some, lose some.

## Evolution Of A SIG

Jack DeTore

M Lembers of the MCCC are fortunate to have a club organization capable of providing for their interests in many ways. Our six chapters are aimed at providing for interest in a particular computer technology (C64, C128, or Amiga), for being the "right" size for meetings (from about 20 to about 80), and for being reasonably considerate of members driving time between their homes and the meeting locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. This arrangement also serves to provide experience for our members in organization leadership.

Given a large enough club membership, other centers of interest develop that can cut across all of the chapters. A good example is our club BBS (like 50% to 60% of the membership). But additional interests may represent only a relatively small segment of the club membership and this is the basis for a SIG (Special Interest Group). In 1990, a SIG was formed of MCCC members interested in Computer-Video. We called it VidSIG. This article tells about some of the decisions that took place and some of the "why" behind our actions. Maybe other future SIGs can improve on the experience.

## SigIncentive

Several (this means at least three) individuals find they have common interests in a specialty activity that involves their computers. They decide to meet and trade ideas in more depth to augment the more general information picked up at club chapter meetings. Some have Amigas, some have 128s, or 64's. They are now a SIG. Simple as that. That's how VidSIG was formed in January 1990. Other examples might include computers and HAM radio, cellular phones, programming in APL, etc. But wait...

## SigFriends

One of the MCCC members in the SIG is also associated with another circle of people (read this, nonmembers of MCCC) having similar interests. It would be great to meet jointly "at their place". It is courteous to share resources some way... through time, talent, or donations. Both groups gain. But wait...

## SigBigger

where interested circles of non-members of MCCC have been encountered. They don't have horns.) The answer is: "Of course." But wait...

## SigBucks

It is not nice to call people after you've been working too late at the office to tell them where and when the meeting is. So, written meeting notices on how to get there, etc. are required. The wife's stamp supply can be raided only until she finds out that there's not enough to do the bills. Then that's it! "Small" cash is needed by the SIG for stamps, notices, letters, etc. A member's home is fine for a small group but not for large joint meetings or those with a lot of equipment. If room rentals are required, then "big" cash is needed. It may be too much of a burden on SIG members to support major fees as well as the normal club dues and groceries. The MCCC treasury cannot and should not be expected, however, to subsidize a SIG. The nature of the SIG is that it is a "small" portion of the club membership. MCCC members should not be expected to support an activity in which they are not interested. So the SIG should pay its own way... keep its own piggy bank and tailor its expenses to what it can cover. In VidSIG's case, we have met as a group only when we could afford an expense from the group's piggy bank or by trading knowledge with our host in return for a meeting place. The fact that meetings are NOT regular has advantages in that hosts may accept meetings on a case-by-case basis rather than being obliged to "schedule" them. Schedules lead to "contract" details that otherwise may not be required. Currently, SIG members cover the cost of mailing bulletins and other meeting expenses. But

## SigSteer

As you can see, there are chores to do to make the SIG go. We evolved a steering committee. The leadership of the MCCC SIG is entirely from members of MCCC. While non-members of MCCC have been welcomed there is always the possibility that they may join the club and so they would be eligible to participate in leadership. Another reason for not having "regular" meetings is that SIG people are busy people and meetings should be "good ones" when they are held. Typical steering committee functions include: membership, meetings, consulting and chairing. The chairman represents the SIG at the club executive board meetings and is responsible for the articles on SIG activity submitted to the club newsletter editor. So now the special interest group can function. But wait...

## SigEnd

Friend or acquaintance: "I use a XXX (read nonCommodore) computer but I'm interested in how you're using the video cameras and other editing equipment for computer-video presentations, can I join your SIG and come to the meeting?" (At this point, we can see two cases

If the interest in the SIG subsides and the group is no longer viable, any residuals in the piggy bank may revert to the club treasury and be available to the follow-on SIG should it resume. On the other hand, if interest balloons into a "significant" portion of the club's membership, then it may expect to be treated like our club BBS with the club treasury managing the activity's account in which case the SIG ends and it becomes a full-fledged Club Action Group.

## My Hardware Project

Ned Kelly

I told you last month of my recent acquisition of the A2232 multiport serial card and how I used it to eliminate the A/B switch I had for my modem and X10 home controller. I would now like to describe a project which is using three more ports on the serial card

I have always had an interest in using my Amiga to monitor things happening around my home such as the opening and closing of doors, and I really wanted to do this via my "extra" serial ports. I considered some kind of circuitry which would take eight events, wrap parity and start/stop bits around it, and then send a byte of data to the serial port on a regular basis. That seemed to be a little more than I felt like undertaking, and it finally dawned on me that the RS232 standard provided a way to communicate information both to and from the computer without ever having to send bytes of data.

The "handshaking" that goes on between the computer and a modem is a good example of this. Before the Amiga can begin sending out bytes of data to your favorite BBS, it needs to know that the modem is powered on and that the modem has detected a carrier signal. The way this is done is not by sending bytes of information between the modem and the Amiga but by the more straight-forward method of sampling the on/off status of several of the signal lines going between the modem and the Amiga.

The A2232 card provides three such signal lines that go into the machine. These lines are pin 5 which is known as Clear To Send or CTS, pin 6 which is known as Data Set Ready or DSR, and pin 8 which is known as Carrier Detect or CD. I first wrote a piece of software which

## Evolution of a SIG Continued From Page 5

This last item (SigEnd) has not been addressed by our club's board yet and is just the author's speculation of how things might evolve.

## VidSIG's First Year

So far, VidSIG has been interesting, fun, and also viable. The year is closing with more in the "piggy bank" than it had at the start... at least enough for two more batches of stamps. It has taken a lot of effort by the steering committee to get the SIG ball rolling and to participate in our club's main event METCOM 90. The 1990 steering committee is: Betty Clay (Members), Darrell Simmonds (Meetings), Dewayne Fletcher and Jack Smith (VidSIG Consultants) and myself as chairman.

simply checked every second the status of these three input lines on serial port zero. I ran this program while powering my modem off and on and saw the status of these lines changing. I modified the program to work with any of my serial ports and ran it again on one of my A2232 ports. I eventually determined that these three lines reacted such that they were in one state with the line open (nothing connected to it) and in the opposite state when the line was grounded to pin number 7. This is exactly what I was looking for since all I need to do is to insert a switch between one of the signal lines and ground and a change in the switch would be reflected in a change in the state of the appropriate signal line.

To put the finishing touches on this, I sabotaged my A/B switch which I was no longer using and placed three RCA phono jacks on it for each of the three DB25 connectors on it. For each of the three DB25 connectors I connected pin 7 (GND) to the outside or shielded portion of the corresponding three RCA phono jacks and connected pins 5, 6, and 8 to the center wire of the three RCA phono jacks. ' This resulted in an arrangement which allows three serial lines to monitor a total of nine switches connected by an RCA phono plug. The software was polished so that it can monitor multiple serial lines and when the status of any line changes it will issue an ARexx message indicating which line (CD, CTS, or DSR), on which serial port (unit 0-8), changed to what state (0 or 1). Finally, I wrote an ARexx script which waits around for one of these messages and takes some action appropriate to the current state and the specific switch. For those interested in the specifics, look for this software on one of our November club disks.

We've had meetings in February, April and September with at least thirty people each time. The presentations by talented people have shown amateurs and professionals how to "do it better". Any thoughts for other MCCC SIG's out there?

## Anarchy Another Great One From Psygnosis

Software Review by Bill Raecke

I there anyone reading this that is not familiar with the game Defender? I ask that question because Anarchy is a Defender style game. If you know what Defender is, then you can probably skip down to the recommendation and save some time. But for those who have not been involved with computers as long as some of us have and who may not know the game, I will attempt to explain.

Anarchy is a relatively simple shoot-em-up. The screen has a large central play screen. The spaceship that you pilot always is in the center of the screen horizontally and the passing landscape scrolls behind it. You may move up and down as you like and you may travel in either direction. At the top of the screen is a long-range scanner. It shows your position and the position of all the other objects on or off the screen. The object of the game is twofold. First you must kill aliens. No big surprise there. Each level starts with a certain number of aliens. If you kill them all you move to the next level. And, naturally, if you touch them your energy level is depleted. When you are out of energy the game is over. But it's not quite that simple. The second goal is to protect the canisters at the bottom of the screen. These appear as small barrel-like objects. From time to time one of the . aliens (a Stealer to be specific) will pick up one of the canisters and try to carry it off the top of the screen. You must shoot the alien to stop it. If it manages to make off with a canister it will mutate into another (worse) kind of alien - a Homer or a Bouncer. This is not a good thing. If the alien is close to the top of the screen when you shoot him, the canister he was carrying will smash when it falls to the bottom. Again, not a good thing. You must catch it and place it on the ground gently. Or a sometimes simpler alternative is to keep the canister from being taken at all. Some aliens, when shot, will release a miniature force field. You can grab this force field and

## The New Skyline Continued From Page 3

After about six or eight tries, modifying the pictures between each try with The Art Department, I was finally happy with the results. Then began the problem of the layout itself. How big should it be? Where does the MCCC News title go? What font should I use. But that's another story.

The result of all that effort is what you saw in the place it on one of your canisters to protect it. This will keep it safe from everything but your own shots. If you manage to loose all the canisters on the level (you start with ten on the first level), you are immediately transported to hyperspace. You'll know right away that something is wrong when the screen turns red and an incredible number of really nasty aliens attack all at once. According to the instructions it is possible to survive hyperspace. I'll never know.

When you start the game you have a single laser as your weapon. You can increase your firepower by collecting tokens from the aliens that you shoot. You can pick up tokens that give you double laser power, automatic fire, a canon that will shoot right through aliens but will not harm canisters, a straeker that gives you six side shots, a devastator (smart bomb), a refill for your energy level, a force field to protect your ship from energy depletion on impact with aliens, and nackem

## "There's nothing particularly new here - the only real question is how well it has been done."

power that gives you everything.

There are a bunch of different aliens to be killed. I'm not going to list them all but there are fifteen different types, and each presents its own special challenge.

So now it's time for the recommendation. Those of you who were skimming ahead can slow down now. There's nothing particularly new here - the only real question is how well it has been done. The answer is, very well indeed. This game differs from the typical Psygnosis game in a couple of ways. The first is that the sound and graphics are only excellent. I have to say "only excellent" because several Psygnosis releases have gone far beyond that superlative, notably Blood Money and Shadow of the Beast. But there's nothing wrong with excellent. And the game makes up for it in another way. Unlike Blood Money which is beautifully done but almost totally unplayable, this one can be played by mortals. It is true that you will die rather quickly the first time around, but the second time you will get better, and the third time you will get better again. This one gets a big thumbs-up.

October issue of the MCCC News. But the story doesn't really end there. I was not totally satisfied with the results of the final printed output. Although the original that came off the HP Deskjet was just what I wanted, the print shop was unable to duplicate it accurately and the newsletter itself left a little to be desired. So it was back to The Art Department for me to do some more adjusting. If you look closely you should see a difference in this month's skyline. I hope it's better. I won't really know until you do. The saga continues.

This year METCOM was attended by several people kind enough th share their impressions of the show. Their comments follow.

... Bill Raecke

What a great day for Amiga users! We had a grand time rummaging about the flea market, giggling over Software Etc.'s fun computer gifts, admiring the art of Jean Riley and Marilyn Coughran, waiting eagerly for the several door prize drawings, and visiting with the many other dealers represented. At our chapter meeting I heard someone mention the "howitzers of video equipment", and complain about too MANY things to see and do to get it all in. My favorite thing about the presentations in the theatres was the big screen display... at last I could really see all the intriguing little icons, read the text, etc. as the programs were presented. I was somewhat overwhelmed by all the hardware they had linked together, with all the different peripherals and add-ons and cables running everywhere... and the amazing thing was, it all worked! That took a LOT of planning and designing and preparation on someone's part: Thanks, someone! If you didn't make it to the convention, try harder next year... it's an opportunity beyond compare for learning, exploring, sharing, shopping, and socializing with others with a common interest!

Bill Raecke's excellent demonstration of PageStream and Desktop Publishing was enhanced by the fact that it was our own newsletter he was creating. We saw a line of text arranged on a page selected from an wide choice of layouts (from business card to legal size to do-it-yourself, then watched Bill make that phrase jump through hoops, slanting, rotating, changing fonts, growing shadows, stretching, even turning upside down (although the underline stayed UNDER the words!). Then he fed text into a predefined shape (his favorite newsletter page format), fancied up the title, made the text carry over into the next column, and last but not least had it dance neatly around a handy IFF image of an airplane that happened to be flying by on the disk. Impressive and easily

understood, Bill's demo made me want to dive right in and try PageStream myself.

We also got to enjoy Vernon Graner's presentation of AmigaVision. He put it succinctly: skip the programming step, just run your flowchart! He used some handy sounds (Star Trek sound effects) and images (computer parts) to design before our wondering eyes an audio-visual "quiz". The Amiga spoke "Please click the mouse on the keyboard", then waited for the click. If the mouse click wasn't inside the invisible box around the keyboard (i.e. you clicked the disk, screen, or other part of the picture), you got the "He's dead, Jim!" music, and a gentle no-no message and another chance. Success brought the theme music and congratulations, and the finale: Amiga Vision kicked in a laser disk and began to play a part of a demo presentation about the Amiga's multimedia excellence. The presentation (under development) will entice onlookers to interact with the system with a mouse click, etc., then offer choices for more info. AmigaVision can jump to the requested spot on the laserdisk, then on with the show! Seeing it all on a Big Screen was wonderful, as we could see the clever, detailed icons and follow clearly every step Vernon used to create the "program". Boy, he knows his stuff! Anybody want to give me a copy of Amiga Vision?

Don Dusky, Commodore's District Sales Educational Director, gave an interesting talk to a good-sized crowd eager for news from Commodore. He saluted us, the users, as the ones who have accomplished the miracle of Commodore's growth by sticking by them, forgiving their (admitted) failings, and telling our friends about the new products that are really worthy of praise. He explained that the thrust now is towards the education market, with a lot of tough competition and reputation to overcome. The business market will have to wait until really good business software is created. Mr. Dusky says he and Commodore are truly interested in any ideas, suggestions, sales opportunities, etc. that we, the user groups and Amiga supporters, have to contribute. He also thanked the team at Amazing for their support. We can reach him through them and other local dealers.

This was the first METCOM for me and I can say it was very impressive. I joined the MCCC in order to learn how the

Amiga could be used in video production. METCOM this year was aimed right in my direction. Amiga artist Marilyn Coughran shared her fantastic art and showed us what a talented person can do with Deluxe Paint III. Marilyn also showed how to make slides of Amiga art and how she transfers the art to video tape. Bill Raecke, master of PageStream 2.0, gave a great presentation on how to get around in Pagestream as well as short cuts and tips about desk top publishing. There were dealers showing some of the latest releases including Aegis AudioM aster II.

If I could pick just one highlight it would be Dewayne Fletcher and Jack Smith and their VidSIG workshop. Jack demonstrated S-Video tape editing using an infra-red system to cue the editing system. Jack also showed the video he shot of the Video Toaster which gave me my first view of the elusive Toaster. Dewayne showed how to use a frame buffer to capture a video image then save that image to disk. He also showed how to display a 24 bit image through the frame buffer. The networking system Dewayne demonstrated was also quite impressive. For those of you who need a system of this type you want be disappointed. METCOM was very informative and I am looking forward to METCOM 91.

The first demonstration in METCOM's south theater featured Amiga artwork by Marilyn Coughran. Marilyn showed a wide range of her Amiga art that she has spent considerable time and talent to produce and transfer to 35mm slides. The audience was treated to several different styles of art mostly created in low resolution with popular commercial drawing programs. From still-life flowers to abstract vases, landscapes to computer "doilies" perfect exposures to "mistakes" that turned out to be very appealing to the audience she commented us through a collection of her work.

After seeing the final product, Marilyn took us on a quick run-thru of the handouts she provided that explain in detail the procedure for transferring artwork to slide or print

## The SuperDisks

Library Information From Harold Williams

This month we will bok at the third of the WorkBench/CLI utility disks in the SuperDisk collection. SD-WBUtil3 contains sixteen utilities that will enhance your Amiga WorkBench and CLI. Each of these programs comes with complete instructions.

AutoDiskChange will allow the use of the FastFilesystem on floppy disks. Using the FastFilesystem speeds up disk access and also will increase disk storage by about 5%.

There are three calculators included on this SuperDisk. CalcKey provides a memory resident pop-up calculator. CalcKey can automatically insert numbers into any project. This is really handy when working with a spreadsheet, database or word processor. HP-II is the second calculator on this disk. This calculator emulates a HP11C calculator. It is even programmable. The third calculator is PCale. This calculator is designed for programmers. It works with bases 2, 8, 10, and 16. It also includes Boolean logic.

CB is a console buffer to be used in conjunction with the CLI. CB creates a buffer (the size is user defined) for all the data that is sent to the CLI. CB also adds a proportional gadget on the right of the CLI window. Grabbing this gadget allows you to review the contents of the CLI buffer. The contents of the buffer can also be sent to the printer.

Clock DJ is a "mouse accelerator" utility. ClockDJ includes not only mouse acceleration, but also screen and pointer blanking, window to front/back, screen shuffling, macro keys, and of course a clock. Included with ClockDJ is another utility to fix the WorkBench Window ToFront

EW changes the way windows open and close. EW stands for Exploding Windows. If you're tired of windows that just pop onto the screen, then EW is just the thing to brighten up your WorkBench.

IconJ is a replacement for IconX. IconJ is compatible with IconX but includes a terrific enhancement. IconJ allows the required script file to be entered into the ToolTypes of the icon. If you use IconX this neat little utility is worth checking out.

There are two utilities on this superDisk for manipulating the palette of a screen. Palette and *Colour vill allow you to modify the palette for any screen. XColour will also allow you to manipulate the number of bit planes.

PPMore is a replacement for More. PPMore will browse any text file. PPMore will also browse text files that have been packed using PowerPacker. PPMore is simple to use because it displays labeled buttons. It also has built-in print capability.

PRFont displays and prints fonts. All fonts in the font directory are displayed. This is a simple way to see all those fonts that you have forgotten about.

StarBlank is a screen blanker. Instead of just a dull blank screen, StarBlank creates a moving field of "stars."

Sort is a replacement for the AmigaDOS sort command. This version of sort will handle 65535 records. Record length can be as long as 254 characters. Eight sort fields in either ascending or descending sequence can be specified. The Shell sort algorithm is used.

Textra is a user friendly text editor. All of the normal text editing features are included. Textra allows editing of multiple documents.

Well, that concludes the fourth SuperDisk review. A second Disk/File utility disk was added last month. That makes a total of fourteen disks in the SuperDisk collection. The SuperDisks are constantly growing and changing. Check the updated list at the monthly meetings.

## Amiga Library News

Public Domain and Shareware Picks From Bill Raecke

## 'The A64 Package by Questronix

This package will be of interest to anyone who has recently upgraded to an Amiga from a C64 or to anyone who is considering such an upgrade. The A64 Package is a C64 emulator for the Amiga. The entire package consists of the software included in the library and a hardware interface available when you become a registered user. The software provides full C64 emulation. It is easily installed and when run will bring up a screen that looks and acts exactly like a C64 screen. You can then type commands, write BASIC programs, or load and run programs off disk. By pressing both Alt keys simultaneously, the C64 emulator is frozen and you are taken to the A64 Prefs mode. This is where you tell the A64 system things such as whether the C64 or the Amiga should control the parallel port, which game ports are in use and what kind of devices are plugged in, and what drives are being used as Amiga drives and which are C64 drives. While the A64 Package is frozen, all activity stops and you can perforn all normal functions with the Amiga (memory permitting). When you exit the A64 Prefs you are returned to the A64 just where you left it. Any program in progress will continue where it left off.

This is pretty neat stuff. I tried a couple of programs and they seem to run just fine. The only problems I noticed were the speed (it appears to be slower than the (64) and the and the sprite handling (on the games I tried the sprites blinked on and off annoyingly).

The package also has a couple of shortcomings by design. The first one is that the version available in the library will only run on a 68000 processor. 68020's and 68030's are not supported. The second shortcoming is, if you are going to run most C64 programs, you will have to use C64 drives. There is no way to plug a C64 drive into the Amiga. Both these shortcomings can be remedied by sending in your $25 donation. In return you will receive an upgraded software package and a hardware interface that will allow you to plug a 1541 into the Amiga parallel port.

It's worth taking a look at. It's on disk MCCC-A\_221 this month.

## -ntuitracker Music

There has been a lot of music in the IntuiTracker format added to the library lately. This seems to be a format that is growing in popularity. There were some selections on last month's club disks and this month there are even more. Many of the selections have been nondescript modern compositions with little character and less imagination, but with some of the later additions that seems to be changing. I even found myself adding some of the more recent ones to my hard drive so that I could get to them and play them more easily. That being the case, 1 thought I'd better let you know so you could pick up some of them if you are so inclined. A few of my favorites are Bridge and Chicago Song on MCCC-A\_222, Rainy Night on MCCC-A\_223, Imaginary Woman and Daisy Chain on MCCC-A\_228. But there are lots more worth hearing. By the way, the IntuiTracker player is on the disks with the music. Check a few of them out.

## T. · erminal Programs

This is a good month for those of you who are into Telecommunications with some of our excellent library offerings. This month there are three upgrades available. VIl' is a program designed primarily for connecting with large systems. It has such niceties as Tektronix emulation for graphic processing. Version 4p846 is on disk MCCC-A \_222. The companion program, VLTir, can be found on MCCC-A\_226. It is virtually the same program but without the Tektronix emulation. Version 1.01 of the popular JRComm can also be found on disk MCCC-A \_226. It, too, will allow connection to a mainframe and offers such things as VT-100 and VT-102 emulation.

## Amiga Mysteries

by Johnny C. Kitchens don't. These color screens appear at boot-up and will or may stop boot-up completely. This is the Amiga's way of trying to tell you that something is wrong and what it is. But what do they mean? Commodore decided not to include this info in the manual. After searching, I've found the answer, sort of. After searching and thinking that I had found the answer I found a second answer. Although similar, they are a little different. I decided to include them here and let you decide. Which is right is your choice.

Mysteries have fascinated many people throughout time and they continue to pop up from time to time. Mysteries have even gained their own TV series. For the Amiga, mysteries have been abundant since its inception. Some have been well documented - others that I've seen haven't even been mentioned. Ill touch on the well known ones and share some of the ones I've found. If you already know these yourself, welcome to the mysteries of the Amiga.

Color

First explanation

Green

Chip Ram Failure

Yellow

68000 Trapped before Guru installed.

Second explanation

Problem has occurred while local memory is being configured. Note: The green symptom is present on units with socket Fat Agnus contact problems.

Unexpected exception has occurred.

Blue

Error in PAD (Custom Chips)

Problem has occurred during custom IC register check.

Red

ROM failure

Kickstart ROM has bad checksum.

If you see the Dark Gray screen everything is OK and the Light Gray means the software is OK. These came with the second group, leading me to lean their way. Also with the second group came an answer to another mystery - the flashing shift key light. One flash means that the ROM internal to the keyboard processor has failed. Two flashes means the RAM to the same processor has failed. Three flashes means failure of the watchdog timer or IC 74LS123 or associated circuitry. At least the Amiga tries to take the mystery out of system failure.

Guru has been the big mystery of the Amiga since day one. The most common question people ask when they see this evil looking red box with the red writing in it is "What's that?" or "What does that mean?". You can ignore this suddenly appearing menace or search for a meaning. There is help for you. Look for the PD program called "Guru". Just give Guru the first 8 digits of the "guru meditation number" and it will give you something, although most of the time it still doesn't make any sense. Another form of help is in the program called Alert. You simply run this from the startup-sequence. Then when your Amiga gurus Alert intercepts it and adds a much better description of what happened. It tells you what program caused the problem and why. The problem is that it only works about 50% of the time. It's still worth the trouble though just for the occasional info. Another form of help is in the form of GOMF, which is short for "Get Out of My Face". GOMF lets you stop the guru as well as stop the program that caused the problem. It runs in the background waiting to jump on the guru before it can cause the problem. GOMF is now in version 3 and is a commercial piece of software. The mystery of guru is why they did it. It was put there to help developers with their software development. They could look up the numbers and know what changes were needed to make it work. A ground-breaking computer like the Amiga has got to have problems and this was their way to help figure out what is wrong. Trouble is that it is so different that it caused the Amiga to get a reputation as a crash prone machine simply because it was so noticeable. I've noticed that the word guru now pops up → Page 16

One well documented mystery of the Amiga, are the secret messages that appear on the WorkBench screen and in Preferences. Even more significant to me were the signatures that appear inside the 1000's case. There is even a dog's footprint in there. The developers of the Amiga knew they had something special and they wanted to be remembered for their work. Just because the Amiga was better than anything else in the field doesn't mean it would succeed. During the 80's video games and home computers were failing very fast. Seeing this probably was a little discouraging to the developers. If the Amiga had failed, sometime in the future someone could have looked inside and seen who was behind this machine.

My 1000 had an additional mystery which I've heard no one else mention. The manual for the 1000 came in the style of a notebook style binder, which was to allow you to add updates as they came out. Near the back of mine was the partial cover of a softbound book. It was perfectly cut to match the size of the Amiga manual pages complete with the proper holes to fit. It was cut strangely so that only a section of the front and back of the book cover could be seen. The title seemed appropriate in some way to me. It was "How to Kazoo". Think about it.

One mystery that has been with the Amiga since the beginning are the colorful flashing screen some people get and others may never see - at least let's hope you

## New C64 Scanner

Downloaded From Quantum Link

H -andyscanner is a unique product and the only one of its kind for the C-64. I consider it worth the money and if you have a need for this kind of DeskTop Publishing tool then it is a great buy. This scanner is imported from overseas and a few things (such as the manual) do have to be changed to make it a more viable product for sale in the U.S. Handyscanner comes with an interface for the scanner that plugs into the RS232 port, excellent Desk Top Publishing software, a 400 dpi hand-held scanner that has an effective scan width between 2.75 and 3.00 inches, and a power supply for the scanner.

To test Handyscanner I used one 1581, a flat C128, a 40 column monochrome monitor, a C1351 mouse, JIFFYDOS (v6.0), an Epson RX80 printer (9 pin) and a Panasonic KXP 1524 (wide carriage 24 pin) printer. Handyscanner allows commands to be sent over the disk drive channel so you can switch partitions on drives, scratch files, etc. I believe it should work with any disk drive including a Hard Drive. One of the reasons I consider this package a good value is not just because someone has found a way to hook up a scanner to the C-64 but because the software that drives the scanner is excellent. It is full featured and very easy to use. It comes with the disk version of Pagefox and it supports a virtual bitmap of 640 x 400 pixels with tools to move around the bitmap easily either by gradual scrolling or jumping to a particular 320 x 200 pixel area.

Handyscanner also supports bitmaps up to 640 x 800 pixels with the addition of the Pagefox cartridge. The Pagefox cartridge is a plug in ROM/REU for the cartridge port that has a 100k RAM buffer and comes with the Pagefox software resident on the cartridge. To capture images you specify what percentage of the screen you want filled with the image you are going to capture. The horizontal width can be set from 33% to 300% of the screen. You can also set the vertical height of the capture to lengthen or shorten a scanned-in picture. The vertical bitmap area is divided into either four or eight 320 x 200 areas you can jump to, or you can define your own 320 x 200 area in which to do closeup work.

You can draw using solid lines or with patterns using the following tools: small pen, large pen, lines, squares, or circles.

SCANNER: The scanner comes with four controls, three of which you can adjust. (1) Contrast switch (2) Brightness switch (3) Capture settings switch. Black and white, 3 levels of dithering for color scans. the scanner appears to be a regular PC hand-held scanner so you should be able to take it along if you ever upgrade to another computer. You should also be able to plug different PC scanners into the interface.

FUNCTIONS: Various functions can be picked that

will be affected by the selection of previous commands. This is very useful for filling in areas or deleting them.

CLIP: As soon as you clip an area it automatically puts you into Brush (stamp) mode. It is a very handy feature for pasting pieces together on the screen without having to go back to the menu and activate brush mode like so many programs force you to do.

SPONGE: (A sprite eraser) Pattern fills only affect the current 320 x 200 pixels area. Plus, you can lay one pattern on top of another for some really good effects. You can capture and save patterns to disk for later use.

DIRECTORY: Everything can be picked by the mouse. Usually there is no need to touch the keyboard for commands unless you are saving a file.

MERGE: You can save sections and strips of the screen to disk for later recall. This is a very handy way of splicing a screen together that is wider than what can be scanned into the computer at one time. Also you can save clips to disk to build your own clip area package.

TEXT: First, type the sentence. Then using the cursor you can position it anywhere on the screen. You can rotate it, flip it, etc. Suppose you find the phrase is too long and doesn't fit? No problem - just backspace and cursor around again to fit the sentence into its space. It's very easy and very neat!

ZOOM: You can zoom into an area and edit it using the mouse very easily. You can click on and off individual pixels or if you hold down the active button to enter into an on or off mode that isn't exited until you click the button again.

REDUCE: You can reduce the bitmap screen by 1/2 very quickly transforming a big scan into a clearer, condensed image.

PREVIEW: You can preview the whole 640 x 400 or 640 x 800 area on screen at one time. This is accomplished by reducing the bitmap to a fair approximation of what the virtual bitmap will look like printed out. Of course, you lose the finer details but is good enough for viewing the general layout and for placing graphics recalled from the disk.

PRINTOUTS: EXCELLENT!! What is the sense of using a DTP program if it does not give the user a good printout? This is where the program really shines since it gives an EXCELLENT full page printout. You can also print out any of the predefined 320 x 200 areas, half a page or any 320 x 200 area you define. I found both the 9 pin and 24 pin printouts to be both good to excellent with the 24 pin printouts having no gaps between the pin strikes. Both were printed to fill a whole page from side to side and from top to bottom.

Various speed and printout qualities are available. If you have a printer buffer you can dump a low resolution printout to the buffer for a test printout and go back to work a minute or so later. There is no need to stop working while the printer does its stuff. This program is fast. It also is blessed with a stop printing feature. Press the RUNSTOP button and it exits the print-out mode. It also appears to support every dot matrix printer that a C64 owner may have hooked up to his machine.

SHORTCOMINGS: A way to exchange graphics with GEOS, BASIC 8, IPAINT, AAS, and other graphic programs is a must so the captured images and screens can be colorized and used with our own (QUANTUM) DTP graphic programs and tools. As of this writing I am trying to get more details on the graphic formats.

WARRANTY: Six months.

MANUAL: Since I have a beta test manual that was translated from the German language, I can not really make a judgement. It is extensive and the editing is adequate. The manual needs a better indexing system and a clearer, more precise English translation would be helpful. These faults certainly would not keep me from buying the product as the software can easily be used without even reading the manual. A good manual is needed though to get the most from any software, so an improvement is in order.

RATING: Using a rating system of 1-10 with ten being the highest and best I give it a 9 for productivity value.

## Amiga Mysteries Continued From Page 14

regularly in the computer industry as a term describing problems. Must be a lot of people noticing the Amiga and not admitting it.

One thing to look forward to in the future will be the discovery of other hidden mysteries about the Amiga. It's always great to hear that someone has figured out how to do something that was previously unknown or thought impossible to do. Now that's a discovery.

I decided to save this one mystery for the last. I've recently noticed these strange messages in the 2000 manual. There are 12 in all. Have you seen them? What are their significance? Do they have an unknown, to us, meaning? I decided to give you two of the best and let you find the other 10. They are:

"He never could adjust to land, although he tried so hard."

"This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no foolin' around."

As 1 look at these two 1 ask myself if there is a reason for their being. I can't answer that question - maybe you can. A mystery for sure.

## Amiga By-The-Loop Brent Wood

We welcomed David Owens back from a two month absence with about 40 people at our last meeting. And the meeting was packed with information. David first presented the current proposed slate of club officers for the coming year.

Our presentation was made by John Reagan who represents Celtic Systems, distributors of the GICO SketchMaster graphics tablet. This high-resolution drawing tablet sports 1000 dots per inch with absolute cursor positioning, a four button mouse; a stylus, and software driver that makes it compatible with all programs that use a mouse. The tablets (two sizes - 12 X 12 and 12 X

Everyone i s encouraged to attend their chapter meetings this month to elect new club officers and to nominate chapter officers to be elected in December. Our chapter is looking for a new vice president and a new secretary. Nominations will be closed before the December meeting.

After the club business and final announcements about METCOM (for this year) Harold pose everyone was suffering from METCOM burnout. But, I'll say it once again - You shoulda been there. We had two demonstrations. The first was courtesy of Scott Lamb. He brought in a demo version of the new CDTV software he is developing. It is a Chess/Checkers/Backgammon game and it features the same kind of terrific graphics we are used to seeing on our Amigas PLUS a fantastic array of digitized sound that we are unable to have because of

For the second demo, Aaron Hightower demonstrated AmigaDOS 2.0 on his Amiga 3000. This was the first really in depth look I have had, and I

A special thanks to Amazing Computers Fort Worth and David Johnson for providing the demonstration machine and door prizes for the meeting. And congratulations to Baylor Peak and Carolyn Dunn, our prize winners. Be sure and be at the next meeting, November 13, at 7:30 at the NRH Community Center and vote.

We had a very light turnout last month. Since the meeting was the week following METCOM, I sup- must say I was impressed. This new WorkBench interface is everything you could want - and then some. One more time, you shoulda been there. Neither demo was available at METCOM.

Be sure to attend the meeting this month. Not only will we have another excellent demonstration but we will be voting on club officers. See you there.

My, how time flies... I dug out last years post-METCOM 89 newsletter to compare last year's event with METCOM 90, and there, in fine print, it announced a new chapter trying to form... it was us, guys! I hadn't realized it, but our next gathering will be our "birthday"!

CHAPTER NEWS those tiny pictures do what you want. Thanks go to Harold and his expertise. (Harold also produces the

SuperDisk collection available at all Amiga chapter meetings.)

It has been a great year, hasn't it? We did have a smaller than usual turnout last month... METCOM burnout? Just forgot? Go get your pencil Right Now and put the next meeting on your calendar, unless you have one of them thar hi-tek things on your system to remind you. Our president Craig Bird was out flying around somewhere, so V.P. Bob Shary stepped in to direct things. Among the comments and observations: the program UnWarp 1.4 apparently contains a virus, which VIRUSX 4.01 can kill. Note: the program "VIRUSX 5.0" is NOT from the same author, and is not recommended. Our library is VERY carefully monitored to prevent "infections", by the way. There was lots of info-swapping among those there... reports on new software, problems with hardware, recommendations, warnings, good news, bad news, rumors... that's why it's so important to come to the meetings! If you don't have any questions, you just might have the answers a fellow member needs.

We were anticipating eagerly a demo of "Sketchmaster" from Celtic

Systems, but the demo-person never showed.

He's promised Next Month.

Harold Williams saved the day, however, by presenting a fascinating

and educational talk on icons.

For those even more iggerant than me, these are the little

programs, icons, etc.), tools (like DPAINT, BASIC, backup utilities), and projects (output from a tool, like a picture built in DPAINT, a music score from SONIX, etc.). "Project" icons bring up their related tool and load in the "project" file, while "tool" icons merely execute the tool. Harold explained how a "disorganized" disk could cause a delay as the icons representing each file are displayed on the screen. (File copy each file to a clean disk to neaten it up). He also explained the tricky steps to getting the "snapshot" function to properly record your chosen relocation of icons and resizing of windows on a disk or drawer display. Want to design or modify your own icons? ICONED comes with the operating system, and is a bit editor that lets you build an image one bit at a time in 4 colors. ICONMASTER is a PD program that can use a brush as an icon picture, change an icon type and a lot more. (ICONMASTER is on our Misc Utilities SuperDisk.) There was lots more... you shoulda been there. Sometimes the UNscheduled demos or talks are better than the planned ones!

Next month: the 3rd Wednesday is the day before Thanksgiving, and as a lot of us will be out chasing turkeys that day, we've moved our meeting back one week, to November 14th, 7:30, same place (Richardson Civic Center). Perhaps there will be Birthday Surprises for our chapter! If you don't make it (shame on you!), then have a happy Thanksgiving!

dition seemed to keep us down at 300 bps, so we learned why 1200 bps, or faster, is desirable. We downloaded a program which worked perfectly later. We browsed the message base also. After getting the general feel, Glen cranked up Qlink, which can be described as a commercial BBS. You can find just about any area that might interest you, including real time interaction with many other signoners at the same time. About half of the service is non-plus time (connect time fees covered by the monthly minimum charge), with the plus time costing around 8 cents per minute, and the basic fee contains one hour of plus time built in. Being logged on in the privacy of your own home lends itself to forgetting how much plus time you have accumulated, but you quickly learn to pace yourself.

In November we will have a drive alignment checking program. If you can bring your disk drive, or just a disk that you formatted on it, we should be able to give you a fairly good assessment of its alignment status. We will also have a comparison of BASIC and C, and the relative merits of each.

Until then, be cool or be square.
