## Deluxe Video III

Amiga Software Review by Craig Bird

Deluxe Video III is Electronic Arts' latest release of Mike Posehn's refined and much improved multimedia program. Thanks to the courtesy of Clark Smith, Territory Sales Manager of Electronic Arts for the state of Texas, I have been able to spend a good deal of time becoming acquainted with Deluxe Video III's numerous and powerful features.

Deluxe Video IIl is a set of four programs that give you the power to build multimedia presentations combining music, sound, pictures, and animations created on the Amiga. You can store these presentations on videotape or on disk. Although DeluxeVideo III maintains the same visually oriented interface as it predecessor, the program has essentially been rewritten from the ground up. DVideo III (as I'll refer to it) no longer works with the concept of "dual playfields". Instead it supports all Amiga graphic modes including HAM, Extra Halfbrite, overscan, hi-res, interlace and SuperBitMap. The former version of DVideo saved video files that included all of the data in the video file. DVideo III saves "unbundled" video files. That is, it saves the video file as a script and the data remains completely separate. This gives the user the flexibility of creating multiple videos using the same data files.

The components of DVideo III are:

1. DVMaker, which controls what's in the video and how it is presented. DVMaker lets you introduce sounds, images, and animations (all referred to as parts) that have been created with other Amiga programs, and combines them into a coordinated presentation.
2. DVMover, which moves DVideo III files among the program's components and to other disks.
3. DVPlayer, which plays the videos you create.
4. InstantSlideShow, which creates a video that displays a series of pictures.

There are many new features included in DVideo III. First, you can use the anim and animbrush files you create with DeluxePaint III in your videos. You can manipulate animations just as you would a picture and animbrushes just as you would any other brush. You can also convert a section of your video into an animation file by using the Make Anim effect. Second, the number and types of Tracks and Effects in DVideo III is much increased over its predecessor. For example there are six types of tracks available in the video script and eleven available in the scene script (author's note: there can be many scenes in each video you create) including; anim, backdrop, background, brush, device, picture, and sound. More than forty effects (used to refine your video) are possible, such as; color cycle, fade in, fade pattern, hide, movepath, pickup, position, scroll, slideout, and unload. To keep the program as straight-forward and unintimidating as possible for new users, DVideo III includes an Expert mode in DVMaker. With Expert mode turned off, you have access to all of the essential features, and the program protects you from yourself a bit (by ignoring meaningless settings.) When you turn on Expert mode, you have access to additional Tracks and Effects, and the program gives you more flexibility in some of the settings. There is a small price to pay, however, as the program doesn't protect you from yourself; after all, you're an expert!

DVideo III includes a Control track and effects such as Wait, GoTo, and Label, which make it possible to construct interactive videos. You can make your video branch based on joystick movements using the joystick effect, or you can make your video branch when the user clicks on an object (such as a brush.) Also, DVMaker includes a MovePath effect that lets you define the movement of a brush by dragging it across a preview screen. Better yet, you can edit the path after you've created it. In addition, you can now achieve true relative motion by attaching one moving object to another moving object. For example, you can create a satellite brush that orbits a planet brush. Then you can set the planet brush on a path across the screen, Your satellite brush will move across the screen with the planet brush because that is the object to which it is attached. Included in this four disk DVideo III set are two examples disks titled DVExamples1 and DVExamples2 that include various parts

## Battle Chess

## A C64 Software Review by Eldor Luedtke Jr. Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Do you play Chess? Do you think you would like to learn the game? Well if you're even remotely interested in the game of Chess, I think you're going to like Battle Chess by Interplay.

true, you don't need your trusty parameter copier to back this one up.

The game may be played in a variety of ways, you can play on a 2D or 3D board, with or without sound or animation; but the real fun is the 3D as this is where the animation and sound are, and this is where Battle Chess shines. The game is played with a joystick or the keyboard and has pop down menus to set the options (sound, battle, walk, etc.). You can play against another player or the computer with 10 skill levels, or you can watch the computer play both sides (this can be both entertaining and instructive). There is also an option to set up the board to play classic Chess problems.

On the negative side, the game goes to the disk for the animations and this takes some time, slowing game play, but then Chess is really not a hurry up kind of game.

Let's start with the manual. It's well written with all the info you will need to play the game, even if you don't now play Chess. It starts out with the basics of the game and board, then covers the individual importance of each piece, castling, check/checkmate and Chess notation. Is it soup yet? No, now we go on to what the three phases of a chess game are and some pointers for doing well in each (The opening, middle and end), and let's not forget the drawn games, it covers this as well. You will find 20 complete Chess games in the back of the manual. If you're already a chess player, you will find most of what you need on the reference card, it covers loading, the menus and player interface.

When you boot up the game, the first thing you will see (after the title screen) is a screen giving you the options of 1) Make a Backup Copy or 2) Play the game. Yes, it's

In closing, I'm not one to set down to a board to play Chess and until now have found no other computer Chess game that grabs me. I like this one. It's just plain fun to play and I think Interplay did an outstanding job on it.

## Deluxe Video III (Continued From Page 1)

such as animbrushes, brushes, pictures, sounds, and tunes. When reading through the tutorial in the D Video III manual, it takes you through setting up a shuttle launch complete with flames and smoke trailing the ascending shuttle!

With DVideo IIl you can use a picture as a pattern behind another picture to create smooth wipe effects and other special effects, such a breaking windows. Or you can use a brush as a tiled pattern. If you want a pattern background for your video, you can create a complex pattern from a small brush by tiling it and thus save a lot of disk space. Now you can also append one video onto another with one simple menu command.

Other new features include the Text Line requester, which allows you the ability to access fonts from any drawer. If you have fancy fonts or perhaps a hard drive with a large fonts directory you'll like this one. The Cut and Paste features in DVideo Ill are much more powerful, too. You can now cut and paste tracks, effects and even scenes in your video. You can also cut and paste from one video to another. Once you create a scene, you'll never have to create it again, just paste it into a new video. A note of caution here; save your work frequently when creating scenes, especially large ones. It is possible to spend a considerable amount of time creating a scene, particularly in light of the fact that this program is highly addictive!

The DVExamples disks contain two extra modules that you can use with InstantSlideShow which makes it easy to create a slide show that displays pictures and animations with random wipe effects. Once you've put together a slide show you can open it in DVMaker to embellish it.

DVMover helps you move your videos from one disk to another. Since the video needs to keep track of the location of all your data for the video, this module is essential to moving your videos.

DVPlayer is a program that plays one or more videos. It comes complete with its own control panel (like the one used in DVMaker) and has keyboard equivalents for all its commands. The control panel is very similar to that of a VCR and most useful. DVPlayer is also freely distributable in its entirety, so that non-owners of DVideo III can view what you've created!

Deluxe Video III is a very well thought out multimedia program with a well documented manual, including easy-to-follow tutorials and an excellent reference chapter. This one belongs in your graphics collection if it's not already there!

DVideo III also has a ARexx port through which you can connect a genlock device and midi device. There is a sample program included to run the SuperGen genlock and other files for C programmers to create their own programs to communicate through the ARexx port. Electronic Arts will not be giving technical support along these lines however as they would have to add a considerable support staff. Instead, they refer programmers to contact the manufacturers of these devices and/or the compiler makers.

## SOFTWARE

## New Stuff I Just Got

Amiga Software Reviews by Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

It's been a busy month. So busy that I haven't had a lot of time to open new software to review. This month I'll be brief. Please hold the applause.

## Shufflepuck Cafe by Broderbund

Here's the deal. You're a Krypton-3 salesman who finds himself stranded in a seedy bar on the wrong side of town -- for that matter, on the wrong side of the galaxy. You need to make a phone call to get a repair sled to come

"The sound effects, visuals and, above all, the fast reaction of the paddle give the game a very realistic feel."

and pick you up, but the only phone is on the other side of the bar and in order to get there you'll have to win a few games of Shufflepuck. The premise is actually rather unimportant except for the fact that your opponents seem to have come from all corners of the galaxy. They lend a refreshing taste of humor to the proceedings.

Shufflepuck is a game much like air hockey. You face your opponent across a table and try to shoot the puck into your opponent's goal with a paddle which you control with the mouse. The sound effects, visuals and, above all, the fast reaction of the paddle give the game a very realistic feel. There is virtually no delay between the movements of the mouse on your desk and the movement of the paddle on the screen.

As you begin the game, you are shown a picture of the possible opponents. You can select any of them by pointing and clicking with the mouse on his, her, or its picture. Alternately you can begin the tournament mode by pointing at and clicking on the scoreboard. In tournament mode you must face all the opponents in the bar, one at a time, until you beat them all or you are beaten by one of them. Picking them individually gets you lots of practice but won't get you on the scoreboard. There's one other big difference -- when facing players individually you can adjust the difficulty of the game by adjusting the paddle characteristics. Making your paddle as wide as the table gives you great defense but it is rather difficult to place a shot with no side to side movement. You can also adjust the bounce settings for the paddle - how hard you can hit the puck and how fast it will travel as a result. For more difficult games you can even add a block in the center of the table.

Here is a brief rundown on the bar's residents.

Skip Feeney is a wimpy little kid. He might give you some trouble if you close your eyes.

Visine Orb is a native of Squalor III. He's a short little rascal with big eyes -- and not a very good player. If he hits the puck, it's strictly by accident.

Vinnie the Dweeb is a grad student. He's pretty good at shooting but is still not difficult to beat.

Lexan Smythe-Worthington is a lizard from one of the finest families on Saurus Vill. When you first face Lexan, he is really tough. Lexan's problem is that he drinks a little. During the game, he takes little sips from a glass of champagne and his play gets steadily worse and worse. At the end of the game he passes out.

The General is the first real challenge. As a matter of fact, I have yet to beat him. He is good. He has just one weak spot as far as I can determine and if you can place your shots accurately, you can get them by him. Not easy.

Nerual Ttoille is a strange creature with no face. But don't let that fool you. He's rough. (Actually, he does have a face - it's just not where you expect it to be.)

Princess Bejin has a serve that won't quit. If you find the secret to beating it, please let me know.

Biff Raunch is the reigning champion. He's also president of the local chapter of Heaven's Devils, so don't cross him.

There is one other opponent as well. DC3-ALSO is a training robot developed by Tons-O-Fun industries. The advantage here is that you can program him however you want him.

The opponents, as I said before, lend a bit a humor. What makes the game habit-forming however, is the exceptional game play. It's so quick and realistic that you'll find yourself spending a lot more time playing than you originally intended to. It comes highly recommended.

## GEos - Part 2

## C-64 and C-128 Software Information by Eldor Luedtke, Jr. Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Last month, we covered what G.E.O.S. is and what it can do for the 8 bit Commodore as well as other 8 bit computers. This month, we will take a look at what comes with G.E.O.S. 2.0 for the Commodore 64 and the Commodore 128. We will also look at where the 64 and 128 versions differ.

## DESK TOP:

The Desk Top is the first thing you will see when you boot up G.E.O.S. This is the application you will use to manage your files. From here you may copy, duplicate, rearrange, lock, unlock, rename, delete, view or enter info and even print your files. Starting from the top left of the screen across are seven pull down menus.

- (1) GEOS. From this menu you select your printer driver, input driver joy stick, mouse or koala pad (this need only be done once as the desk top will rearrange the files to make you're selection the default)) and call up any desk accessories you have on the disk. 128 note: You need not have a printer driver on any disk except the boot disk as it's placed in ram on boot up, the 64 version must have the printer driver on all work disks you print from.
- (2) Files. From here you may open, rename, print, duplicate, call up info on (a brief note may be placed here about the file, this is where you lock/unlock files) or delete selected files. You may also undelete the last deleted file if you do it before you change disks.
- (3) View. From here you select the way you wish to view your files (icon, by name, by date, by size or by type). 128 note: On the 128 version you may work with your files in any of these, but on the 64 version you can only work with your files in icon mode; text modes are for viewing only.
- (4) Disk. From here you may open, close, validate, copy, rename or formate a disk.
- (5) Select. From here you may select all files on a page, the border or the whole disk for batch processing. Note: You may also select files for batch processing by pressing the C= key and the number of the file, flipping through the pages to select only the ones you want.
- (6) Page. From here you may append or delete a page.
- (7) Options. From here you may set clock, reset (to redraw screen and reread drive/drives), go to basic or boot a selected non-GEOS file.

On the top right you will find a 24 hour calendar clock that may be set by clicking on it or going to options and clicking on set clock. This clock is important as setting it will make it easy to determine which is the latest version of a file by its time and date (called up from info in the file menu).

At the bottom left you will find the printer icon. It will have the name of the selected printer driver under it. You may print a file by dragging the file's icon and placing it on the printer icon. Another way to print a file is to select the file and than press the C= key + P or print from the file

At the bottom right you will find the waste basket. It works just like the printer icon, but this one deletes selected file or files. The name of the last file deleted is displayed under the waste basket.

## GEOPAINT:

Geopaint is a full featured high-res graphics editor. Unlike most graphics programs for the 64/128 this one is based on an 8.5 x 11 page, not just one screen. The screen is used as a window to view the portion of the page you are working on. Geopaint also uses pull down menus to call up desk accessories, close, update, preview (to look at what the page will look like), recover (to read the latest version back from disk), rename, print, quit to Desk Top, cut, copy paste, draw/erase grid lines and select a font for text. The name of the file is displayed in the title bar at the top right. On the left is the tool box containing 16 icons to scroll, select and edit, fill (with current pattern), air brush, a ruler, lines (connected), paint (with current pattern), pencil (for free hand drawing), squares/rectangles, filled squares/rectangles, circle/ellipse, filled circle/ellipse (filled square/rectangle and filled circle/ellipse use the current pattern), color (select from 16 colors to set the background and foreground color and undo (to undo any changes made since last update to disk). Under these icons you will find one more icon - the fill pattern icon. Click here to select from 32 fill patterns. 128 note: In the 128 version of Geopaint you can work in 40/80 col (color in 40 col only) and you can turn off the tool box in 40/80 to use the full width of the screen. In 80 col you are working the entire width of the page and may edit, copy, cut or past larger area than the 128 40 col or the 64 version of Geopaint.

## GEOWRITE 2.1:

Geowrite 2.1 is a "what you see is what you get" word processor. What this means is you see the fonts and page format on the screen as it will look on paper. Geowrite 2.1 supports headers, footers, date/time stamping, search and replace. It supports the following type styles: underline, bold face, super/sub script, italics and outline. You may also mix type styles and fonts on the same line. Formatting is done with the ruler at the top of the document and may be changed from line to line. With this ruler you can set the

left/right margins, paragraph, and up to eight tabs. You can paste text using the text manager (a desk accessory) or paste the last text cut (for moving text from one location to another or past a graphic from the photo manager (a desk accessory). Geowrite 2.1 has six pull down menus.

- (1) GEOS. As with other applications, this is where you will find your desk accessories (Photo Manager, Text Manager, Preference Manager etc.).
- (2) File. This is where you close, update, preview, recover, rename, print or quit to Desk Top. To the right of this you will find rectangle with a smaller rectangle within it, this is the turbo scroll icon for quickly moving to another part of your document. The page number is also displayed here. 128 Note: The 128 ver. of Geowrite 2.1 works in 80 col. only so scrolling is up/down only. C=64 Note: Geowrite 2.1 for the C=64 is 40 col. so to see the page you must set the margins for 40 col. or scroll right and left.
- (3) Edit. This is where you select cut, copy or paste for both text and graphics.
- (4) Options. Here you will find search, find next, change, hide pictures, open header, open footer and select page.
- (5) Page. Here you will find previous page, next page, go to page, page break, set first page, title page and NLQ spacing.
- (6) Font. This is where you select your fonts.
- (7) Style. This is where you select your type style.

When you're ready to print your document you are given the options of page range to print, single sheet/tractor feed paper and high (graphics mode), draft (no formatting or graphics, but fast) or NLQ (uses your printer's NLQ character set with formatting, no graphics).

I find Geowrite 2.1 to be very easy to use, yet as flexible and powerful as I will ever need it to be.

## GEOSPELL:

You guessed it, it's a spell checker. Geospell has a 96K dictionary and supports personal dictionaries. It operates with the same point and click interface as the other GEOS based applications. It gives a count of unique words as well as a total words count. Slick and easy to use.

## GEOMERGE:

Use Geomerge to merge data to a Geowrite file from other GEOS based applications like Geofile, Geocalc, Geodex or a second Geowrite document.

## GEOLASER:

Use Geolaser to print with the Apple Laserwriter II. Laserwriter fonts are supplied. 128 Note: To print using the Laserwriter II works in 40/80 col.

## PAINT DRIVERS:

The Paint Drivers creates two files called Paint

Overlay and Paint Pages. These allow you to print your documents to disk as Geopaint files so that you can use Geopaint to add special effects like columns and color to your document.

## TEXT GRABBER:

The Text Grabber allows you you import text files from other text editors.

Last but not least are the desk accessories. These files may be called from any GEOS based application without leaving the application or the document you are working with.

## THE CALCULATOR:

The Calculator is a full featured calculator that will use standard numbers or scientific notation using the following keys + (add), - (subtract), / (divide), * (multiply),. (decimal), E (exponential), C (clear), Inst/Del (clear entry, Shitt &amp; (close), and C= C (copy to text scrap to paste into your document).

## THE PREFERENCE MANAGER:

Use the Preference Manager to set your border, background and foreground colors, and mouse speed. And you can set the time/date here if you forgot to do it from the Desk Top.

## THE ALARM CLOCK:

Use the Alarm Clock to let you know when it's time to quit playing with your computer and do other things. Good for staying out of the dog house.

## THE NOTE PAD:

Use the Note Pad to leave yourself short notes and reminders.

## THE PAD COLOR MANAGER:

Use the Pad Color Manager to colorize your Desk Top, making it easier to identify file types by giving each file type it's own color. 128 Note: This is for 40 col only.

## THE PHOTO MANAGER:

Use the Photo Manager to create and use Photo Albums for pasting graphics in your documents.

## THE TEXT MANAGER:

Use the Text Manager to create and use Text Albums for pasting text to your documents. Good for phrases and paragraphs you use a lot.

Looking at what you get with G.E.O.S. 2.0 I think it would be very hard to get the power and flexibility in any other package or packages for near the money. For those who like command driven software, most of the options in G.E.O.S. 2.0 have keyboard equivalents.

"Till next month, happy computing.

Next month we will look at some extras that you can add to your G.E.O.S. system from both commercial and P.D./ShareWare.

## A View From The Gaming World

Amiga Software Reviews by Max Hagedorn Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Hello, I'm back with my second article. I am sorry but I do not have more information on the game awards, or tips but watch for some strategy guides soon.

The following is my rating system. I judge the games on the following categories: Graphics- artwork, animation, and speed; Sound- music and sound effects; Playability- are the controls easy to learn, and do you get better each time you play; Challenge- not too easy, not too hard; and Overall- an average of all the ratings. Each category is rated with bullets (·), from one to five.

- •. + almost bearable

- ... bearable

• ••+ shows a few bugs

- .... close to the best

- •e•+ very close to the best

- . . . • truly fabulous, the best possible

This month I am rating the following games: "Fiendish Freddy's Big Top 'O' Fun", "Superman - The Man of Steel", and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles". Now on with the reviews.

## Superman

This game is pretty good but not great. The graphics during the game are nice and the animation is smooth but the graphics on the comic book pages that introduce each section aren't as good. There are a few music sequences during the demo and the comic pages but no music during the game. The sound effects are alright and there are quite a few. The biggest problem in the game is a lack of challenge. Each time I played the game I made it 2 to 3 stages beyond where I ended the last time and the fact that the manual tells you how to get through each stage doesn't help the challenge much. The game itself is fun to play and easy to learn. The game uses the mouse instead of the joystick so you don't need to buy anything extra to play.

Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! No, its a game! Yes, it's Superman, the man of steel, now on your home computer, and it's your job to guide him in saving the world. But be warned, Superman's job is not easy. Lex Luthor and Darkseid have joined into a deadly alliance and their target is you. You must stop Darkseid's parademons and Luthor's robots, save Lois, and journey into space to protect the Starlabs satellite and destroy Luthor's Lexicorps satellite.

This game is quite good and very humorous. The graphics are nice and cartoonish but they look as though they could use a little work and the animation needs some work. The music fits the game very well with the nice circus-like tunes and the sound effects are nice. The game is controlled by a joystick. The controls for the events are easy to learn. The game itself is very tough to master and takes a lot of practice. If you like the circus or you just like a lot of humor you'll probably like this game.

Ladies and gentlemen, kids of all ages, come one come all to the greatest show in the galaxy! The thrill of the circus now on your own computer only it's you controlling the circus. But, you'll find this is no piece of cake. The Big Greedy Bank Inc. has loaned the Big Top 'O' Fun $10,000 and it's due tonite. How will you get the money? That's the hard part. You must compete in six different events: high diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throw, tight rope, and cannonball. If you do well the judges award you money to pay back the loan. Meanwhile Fiendish Freddy, a small clown with big ideas, is ready to do anything and everything to stop you and make the circus grounds his own.

## Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

The original adjective animals make their home computer debut. The outlook is not good for our four green friends. Their friend April O'Neill has been kidnapped by the Shredder, the arch-enemy supreme of the turtles. After you save her you return home to find your teacher, Splinter, has been kidnapped by, you guessed it, Shredder. After you save Splinter you must track down Shredder's fortress, The Technodrome, and face Shredder inside for the final showdown.

This game was adapted from the Nintendo game and I think Ultragames did a good job. Most of the graphics are very good with the exception of April who has no color to her face whatsoever which makes her look like a ceramic statue. The music is great but it could use some better instruments. The game controls are not too hard to master although from the instructions they sound almost impossible. The home computer version replaced the continue feature on the Nintendo with a save feature which makes the game much too easy. The game is copyable but the manual-based protection is not too good. I liked this game and I would recommend it.

## PLT by Rich Champeaux and Jim Miller

PLT is relatively easy to install. There is a handler which you must put in your I: directory. You must assign a PLTDATA: device somewhere in your system. (This directory will hold font information.) Then you must MOUNT the PLT: device. Having done that, you can then use PLT: as you would any Amiga device. You can set your CAD program to output a file if you like and then use the command "COPY filename to PLT:" to produce your plotter output. It also works just fine if you just tell your CAD program to output directly to the PLT: device.

If you are the proud owner of a CAD package but you don't have a plotter, you need this program. Most CAD packages are designed to produce a very high quality output when the drawing is sent to a plotter, but when it comes to dot-matrix printer output, they fall amazingly short. All that most can manage is a screen dump. PLT to the rescue. PLT takes HP-GL plotter commands, translates them to a bit-mapped image, and then sends that to your printer. In real terms, what this means is that you can now produce an image which is the highest resolution that your printer can produce - not just what your screen can display.

PLT uses your Preferences settings to determine what printer resolution to use. On the Hewlett Packard DeskJet with Preferences set to 300 by 300 dots per inch, the output is indistinguishable to the naked eye from that produced on a plotter. I think these guys may have messed up by releasing this as public domain. It works like a commercial product. Pick up library disk MCCC-A\_176.

## MandelMountains by Mathias Ortmann

These words are from the doc file that accompanies the program. For the most part, the picture that accompanies this article speaks for itself. It's better in color.

"MandelMountains gives you the ability to render wonderful three-dimensional images of blow-ups of the Mandelbrot Set. The well-known color strips of the usual Mandelbrot images become at once mountainsides that smoothly climb to high plateaus, leaving deep valleys between them."

The program has its good points and its bad points. On the minus side is a user interface that is marginal at best. It is also rather slow as Mandelbrot programs go. According to the doc file, rendering times range from 20 minutes to 4 hours. When other programs are able to generate a simple Mandelbrot in seconds, that seems like an awfully long

If you like to fool around with this kind of thing as I do, give it a try. It's Shareware, with a requested donation of $10. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_176.

time. But on the plus side, the program is able to produce 32 color images in interlaced OVERSCAN. They are BEAUTIFUL. And when you save the file as an IFF file, there is an extra piece of information placed in the file that describes the parameters of the image. That allows you to load the picture in at a later date and use those parameters as a starting point for further exploration. The biggest thing in this program's favor, of course, is that there is simply nothing else available for the Amiga that will produce this kind of an image.

## MOCC NAME CHANGE

As announced at the February Chapter meetings, the MCCC Board of Directors has proposed a constitutional amendment to change the name of our club from The Mid-Cities Commodore Computer Club to the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club. Our familiar initials would remain unchanged. It is felt that the new name will better reflect the geographic reality of the club. A vote on the proposal will be taken at the March Chapter meetings. Be sure to attend.

## Word Processing on the C64

## Information from John Ware Mid-Cities Commodore Club

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The C64 is the only modern computer I am aware of on which there is little distinction between text editors, word processors, and desktop publishing packages. This article, therefore, applies only to the C64.)

Word processing on a computer is usually a three step process, entering and editing the text, formatting, and printing. The first step, entering and editing the text is usually the most time consuming of the steps. All word processors, also called text editors, will allow you to load and save text files.

The third step is the actual printing of the file. A few even allow you to set the output to a disk or printer. Almost all have a preview mode to allow looking at the formatted file before you print it. I know of none that actually show an entire page at one time on the screen in a readable form. Even GEOWrite only gives about 1 dot in 10 on the screen. The resultant display is unreadable except for 30 point and larger fonts but you can see how the whole page will look.

The second step, formatting, is simply telling the computer how you want the text to look on the paper. Things like where the margins are and how many lines to print on a page are also part of the formatting step. A few editors such as GEOWrite combine both editing and formatting in the same step.

There are three types of text editors around. The first type is a line at a time. Once a line is entered it cannot be changed unless the whole line is reentered. BASIC on most small computers has an editor that works this way. These are limited to the fonts built into the printer.

The third type of text editor is a graphics text editor such as GEOS or MacWRITE. These are usually called WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors. Most support many font sizes and types and some even allow graphics to be used in the same file. Most place a dot on the screen in the same place where the dot will be on the paper when the file is printed. The dots are rarely exactly the same because of monitor adjustments and the dot spacing of printers but are usually so close that it is hard to find any difference.

Another type is the full screen editor. This is the most common type. You can change anything on the screen and the change will be saved. These usually support printer control commands that allow such things as additional fonts, under and overlining, super and subscripts, or anything else built into the printer. A typical main-frame computer supports both of these modes.

There is no single text editor that does everything. Some are better than others for small files. As an example, the typical note sometimes requires more formatting commands than actual text. A text editor that will print exactly as entered will allow you to format the note by brute force. This is really the way that you do it with a typewriter. This is impossible with some of them.

Not all word processors have the same commands but almost all have the ones shown below. These are the bare minimum commands for a text editor that has any use. Some have so many commands that they become difficult to use. Before buying a word processor, rent it or borrow it first, it possible. This allows you to try before you buy. For short or simple uses one of the best is KWIK-WRITE. For large files such as a small book, PAPERCLIP is a good choice.

Another factor in picking a text editor is the spelling checker: does it have one and how easy is it to use? Here the world's worst has to be KWIK-WRITE. It has a spelling checker of sorts but it will not change the spelling of the original file. The one with PAPERCLIP is one of the best. It will check and change every file on a disk if desired. GEOS 2.0 has one of the easiest to use but it works only on the current active file.

Some text editors even provide programs to convert text from one word processor to another. If you have a lot of files from one text editor it may be possible to convert them for use with another word processor. There are three file types on a 64 and I know of only one text editor that will read and write all three, KWIK-WRITE. But it will not convert a BASIC program file into readable form.

## Common Editing Commands:

Insert: Insert characters starting at the current cursor position. This command can usually be turned on and off. Most word processors set insert on as a default condition

Delete: Deletes one or more characters at the current cursor position. Some word processors have several forms of this command such as delete current word, line, or paragraph. Another form of this command allows you to mark a section of text to delete.

Cut: Similar to delete, except a temporary copy is saved for later use.

Paste: The opposite of the cut command. This command usually allows you to place the text cut from one place to be pasted in the current position.

Search: This command normally allows you to search for a string of characters in the text. Most word processors will prompt you for the search string.

Replace: This command usually replaces a section of text with text either entered by the search or cut command.

## Common Formatting Commands:

Justification: This sets how the text will line up. Left justification means even left margins. Right justification means even right margins. Full justification usually causes both margins to be even. Center causes the text on a line to be centered with equal space on each end. On most word processors, one or more of these can be on at a time. They usually take effect from the line where they are turned on to after the line where they are turned off.

Fill: This command just space fills an area of text.

Margins: The most common form sets the margins to a given character position. Normally there will be a method to set both margins separately. These usually stay set until changed. The top and bottom margins are usually set by the number of lines. Sometimes all four margins can be set in fractions of an inch.

Page Length: This command is usually available in one of you to choose one or the other method of measurement.

Footer: Same as the header except it prints at the bottom of the page. It prints before the bottom margin.

## Printer Control Commands

These are specific to each model and brand of printer. Most printers support either the Epson or Okidata commands. The remaining printers have their own commands. These are used to change the character set used, the character spacing, italics, underline, superscript, and subscript modes. They are also used in graphics modes.

A typical Epson command to switch to italics mode will be two characters, ESC and the number 4. ESC is a non-printable character and may show up in the text file as some strange character. To get fancy with KWIK-WRITE you have to enter the command sequence using an alternate text mode. With editors like PAPERCLIP, there is a printer definition file that you must set up for your printer. All non-text things like underline and italics mode commands get filtered through this file.

Defining a printer file can be difficult and time consuming, but you do it only ONE time when you first set up the text editor. How this is done is different for all text editors. Just get out your printer manual and follow the directions for the word processor.

Header: This command provides a way to have the same text to appear on the top of each page. Can be used for page numbers or almost any text desired. The header is printed after the top margin.

GEOS is one text editor that does not do things in the normal way. Everything uses dot addressable graphics so all other printer commands are not usable. There are probably 50 or so printer drivers available now with more being written every day. You pick one and try it. Many will work on the same printer.

Special thanks to our chapter President for filling in for me last time. It's good to know that he's capable. (I may use you again, David ‹grin&gt;) February's meeting was full of information about future events within the club that you should be aware of. If you depend on the newsletter to get all your info, you're missing some things that newsletter space restrictions simply can't give you. (This is obviously an attempt to lure you away from your computer to attend a meeting once a month.) And, if you are like me, you get the newsletter two days after the meeting. (Didn't I hear that the Postal Service wants to increase first class postage to 30 cents? THAT should get us better service!)

About 35 attendees got first-hand information about a scheduled vote at all March chapter meetings to effect a name change to the club. The current shareware program that donations are being taken for is "Play" ', a Sonix music player. (Plays all those neat music files without having to buy Sonix.)

baited hook!)

Next, we were shown

a nice piece of work by Scott Lamb.

Around Christmas time

Scott was working for Polar Ware, a division of Merit Software, on a conversion of the PC version of "All Dogs Go To Heaven" for the Amiga. He demoed the game for us as he explained some of the troubles he ran into in the four-and-a-half weeks he had to complete his work. As he was moving the program to the Amiga he could not hold himself back from embellishment and a little "Amiga-tizing". The program now sports over a megabyte of digitized music from the movie. Thanks to Scott for his time and experience.

Next meeting is March 13 at 7:30 at our regular meeting place. Be there and be informed. (And a belated welcome to Mark Cooke, our chapter VP.)

## Amiga Central Jack Smith

Amiga networking is here. Ray Howard provided the attending membership with a live demonstration of one public domain solution, the D-Net system. D-Net is a software networking package that can allow one Amiga act as a host (via a serial port) to another Amiga. Ray was able to demonstrate how an Amiga 1000 could load and execute files directly from his Amiga 2000 just as if the 2000's hard drive was mounted on the 1000. The network goes both ways too; the 2000 was able to access any device that was attached to the 1000 as if it were plugged right into the 2000. Ray also discussed how this setup could be expanded by using a modem at each end so that two users could dial up each other and attach to each others equipment. D-Net was written by Matt Dillon with additional support from the guys at Software Distillery. Future versions of this program will be faster, allow up to 15 Amigas to link together and provide better security features. Thanks to Ray for a informative presentation.

began with a short discussion The February meeting on the new proposed name change of our club to Metroplex Commodore Computer Club. The traditional "roomers" portion of the meeting was hosted by Jack Smith and featured Commodore's new Amiga promotions. This will be the last Amiga 1000 trade-in deal by CBM because of new changes in the Amiga's ROM chips that will finally make the 1000 obsolete in Commodore's eyes. Loyal A1000 owners may want to take a look at the Rejuvenator, a clever daughter board replacement for the A1000 that will give it the capability to add the new ROMs, Fat Agnes AND 1 Meg of chip ram for under $500.00. A kit version is also available for under $350.00. The door prize was provided by Computer Emporium and they also had a representative on hand to answer questions about Amiga products.

Next month's meeting will be aimed at the new Amiga owners out there. Topics will range from the Workbench to the CLI to attaching printers and external hardware and we will have experts on hand to answer any questions you may have. Hope to see you there.

At our February meeting, our first event was a visit with Sonia King of Amazing Computers, who thanked all of us who attended their special event. She also reminded us of the special 10% User Group discount on software (be sure to mention your membership when buying or phoning), and Amazing's "try before you buy" policy on many software products.

Our Presentation for this month was offered by David Marshall of Amazing, who introduced the Sharp JX-100 scanner. This nifty device, priced at $899, plugs into a parallel port. It has its own power supply, and uses a small fluorescent bulb to light its subject. The software permitted a wide range of functions, beginning with a rough (25 bpi) scan to help you select the precise image desired. Memory requirements (massive) for your choice of final resolution are calculated as soon as the selection is defined. Then the actual scan is performed, one pass for black and white, three for a color image. In addition to multiple choices of display

mode, the software allows adjustments in sizing, perspective, etc. to the final product. To make the not unreasonable wait for scanning less tedious, a cute little gauge informs you of the scan's progress. The final result is a standard IFF file that can be accessed by other video and art products. Both live scans and pre-packaged demo shots were very impressive. Photos, magazine pages, even currency were reproduced with good color and amazing detail. A fascinating gadget!

Our librarian, Brett Hester, is starting up an ongoing user survey, to give us an idea of what we generally use our systems for, and what our needs are. Be sure to participate in this survey at the next meeting! Also forthcoming is an info sheet with data on BBS services, local dealers, etc., which will be available at meetings.

We welcomed several new members at the meeting, bringing our chapter's total membership to over 50. Please bring a friend when you come -- all are welcome! Members have access to our own BBS ($1/month), where 43 megabytes of Neat Stuff may be had for downloading, including a constantly updated directory of the contents of our 700+ disk club library (printed directory is just $1).

## Arlington/GP Eddie Allen

This time of year, the Saturday workshop meeting room is subject to change. So, if you do not find us in the normal room, just ask the librarian for directions. This month we met in the conference room, so we were in more luxurious surroundings than normal, in addition to a good turn out.

The Tuesday meeting in Arlington was well attended. It was good to see each one that attended. The two line notice placed in the Fort Worth paper by our vice president Jim Souba indicated that the C64/128 interest is still alive in the home community. The ad brought responses mainly from the Fort Worth geographic area. It was good to see the family turnout, the sleeping beauty brought back memories.

Glen Herring presented his timely presentation on the tax preparation package "The Tax Advantage".

Herschel Gibbs' wife is in St. Joseph's Hospital, and everyone's prayers would be greatly appreciated. We all wish the best for Herschel and Billie.

Hank Costello of Budget Computers showed us some of the participation style games that are being used in a Thursday night tournament series at his establishment on Thursday nights, complete with trophies at the end of the run. These programs are available on other computer architectures, but the C64/128 versions appear to bring out a greater degree of responsiveness from you than the others do. Baseball (no strike), bowling, football, and golf are currently being emphasized.

The topic at the February meeting was databases. A database can be thought of as a file cabinet. Each database consists of several files, each containing records and fields. The file is what you are saving. The record is like a piece of paper and a field is one entry on the piece of paper. The uses of a database are to keep lists of items such as books, record albums, name and address lists, listings of disks anything that you need in a certain order. The items are sorted in the order you choose.

Okley Moss discussed Superbase 64 and 128, pointing out each version's differences. John Malmstrom also pitched in. For both versions do not put any spaces in the names of record titles because the title will not be accepted. For the C64, the "label" program will print the files. The C128 version allows you to write a print routine, whereas the 64 version doesn't. The 128 exits from each section of the database by "Ctri Q". Each version has its own unique features.

This database can be difficult to set up but once it is, the system is easy to use. Decide what you want in your records before you start and you will be on your way to a good, useful database. A database is a very powerful utility. It can help you in organizing information in lots of ways, as mentioned before. Read part or all of the manual and you're on your way!

Door prizes were given at the meeting. They were Practical 64, a Typing Professor, and a game called Portal.

Eldor Luedtke, Jr. presented the Geos version of a database - Geofile. The opening menu gives the options to Create, Open, or Quit the database. Create gives you the screen to define your field names. It allows you to draw boxes on the screen in order to show the sizes of the names. With this program you can put spaces between field names. The program works better with a RAM expander and a mouse. You have up to 15 sublayouts to be used for labels and envelopes, etc. The program holds up to 30,000 records. Sorting is slow but the actual search for something is quick. The database is not programmable.

The next meeting will be held as usual at 1:30 pm on March 17th. The discussion will be on the DOS (Disk Operating System), Wedge (64), DOS Shell(128), and Jiffy DOS.
