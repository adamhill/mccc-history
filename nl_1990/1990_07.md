## Five Years of AMIGA

by Johnny C. Kitchens

July 23, 1985. If you have an Amiga and or you are a big fan of the system the date given here should be one to remember, as it is the day the Amiga made it's debut. One source referred to that day as the day many a lesser silicon marvel of the decade became obsolete. On this day Commodore introduced the Amiga to the world, and started a roller coaster ride that many enjoyed while others only endured.

Five years is a long time in the consumer market and the Amiga has made that time with ohhs and ahhs, controversy and change, love and hate. I wonder what the next five years will bring, but we can only take a look at the past five.

Change has been a big part in the life of the Amiga over the past five years; some we've noticed, some may have gone unnoticed. Commodore toyed with several logos. A few even made it out into the world to be seen. Taking the famous checkered ball from the now famous demo was considered. They also considered a plain looking "A" as the logo. Thank you, Commodore, for not using that. A rainbow colored check mark was the winner. Well at least for a while. Now "Amiga" I guess you could say is the logo.

Several phrases came to be associated with the Amiga after its introduction. One still continues to pop up today: "It'll knock your socks off!" Ask yourself how many times that phrase has popped up since the Amiga began showing off its abilities. Another phrase which popped up and then faded away was "The Maserati of Computers". How long has it been since you heard that one?

The Amiga itself has changed a lot. The 1000 brought us the Amiga and introduced the world to its new ideas (and can be found with and without the Extra Half Bright mode). It was on the market barely 18 months. Early in 1987 the 500 and 2000 showed up. Although these two at first appeared to be a compliment to the 1000, they replaced it completely. There were two versions of the 2000 -- a German design and an American design. Commodore decided one was more prepared for the future than the other, and one passed away. I remember the rumors of the UX and AT versions that were to come out. Still waiting. 1988 gave us the 2000HD and the impressive 2500, both of which were just the 2000 with add-ons. Both of these have been modified in 1989. The 2090A controller has been replaced by the new 2091 and Quantum is now the Hard Drive. The 2500 has had it's A2620 68020 CPU card replaced with a newer A2630 68030 CPU card. A less noticeable change to the 2000 series has been the change in LEDs. The red power LED has given away to a green one. The disk drive went from red to amber. The hard drive changed from green to amber. Was this LED change for a reason?

Changes internally have been the big news. The true power of the Amiga, the now familiar custom chips, have gone through changes -- one of which was name. Originally called Daphne, Portia, and Agnes, Daphne became Denise and is now about to change to Super Denise. Portia has become the Paula. Agnes changed to Agnus, Fat Agnus, and Super Agnus. There have been other names such as Obese Agnus heard, but Super was the official version. Now a newer version has appeared. With this new version the Amiga has moved from 512K to 1 meg and now 2 megs of chip ram. The Amiga has moved through three CPUs. The 68000, 68020, and 68030 with the 68040 just over the horizon.

Commodore has changed their handling of the Amiga, at times appearing to some to be confused on how to handle their machine. At first they didn't want the Commodore name associated with Amiga so they hid it in the rear. Commodore wanted the machine to be considered as a serious business machine and felt that the name of Commodore would hurt the image. That changed with the 500 and 2000 -- the name "Commodore" was where you could see it. They tried to make sure that the Amiga was only available from the right places. I remember one dealer would only show the computer to you if you made an appointment. I bet that moved a lot of them. The advertising in the early days I'm sure created the question of ....Continued on Page 3

## Commodore Announces: Free AmigaDOS V2.0 Upgrades

by Steve Peoples

West Chester, Pennsylvania May 24, 1990

Commodore is offering you a FREE Upgrade to AmigaDOS 2.0. This is an INCREDIBLE offer, and one that was not anticipated by any of us in the user community, I think. This upgrade will entail both Hardware and Software changes as well as modifications to the main logic board of your 2000-series machine. Upgrades will only be available through Authorized Dealers and warranties will only be effective if it is installed by an Authorized Commodore Quality Service Center. The cost for the upgrade and installation will be approximately $200.00. To quote the internal dealer newsletter that was FedEx'd into the Dealers on Thursday the 24th,

Buyers of 2000-series machines since April 24th, 1990...

"What is it?". You remember the robed man walking up to the Amiga which was all but hidden and he appeared to be lit up by the computer. It made sense, but only if you knew what they were advertising. For the good of the Amiga, recent ads have been more to the point.

The Introduction of the 3000 gives the Amiga a new push for the future and it appears that Commodore may be prepared to finally market the Amiga as they've never done before - trying to grab hold of the multi-media madness in the business world while enhancing the foothold that it has established.

Commodore's changes from machine specific to more generic construction such as the connectors in the rear have all been for the better. The 2000's ability to be configured or changed gave Commodore a good base to work with. And I've applauded Commodore for offering an upgrade from the 1000 to the 2000. No other company has considered doing that for its users. You have to take the good with the bad in everything. At least there seems to be more good.

It's been a bumpy road, but with the dedication of Amiga users, word of mouth, and proven performance, the Amiga has made it through these 5 years and is poised for the next 5 years of progress. The competition has made plenty of moves on the Amiga's previous advantages. Many of the things the Amiga has been doing for years are now the latest rage in the rest of the computer industry.

version 1.3 after April 24, 1990 and before October 30, 1990. A letter will be inserted into all A2000 series CPU boxes directing the customer to send in the completed CPU warranty card and a copy of the dated sales receipt. For those end-users who have already purchased systems with V1.3, please advise them to send in a copy of their proof-of-purchase and the warranty card (if it has not already been sent). The warranty card and proof-of-purchase should be sent to:

Commodore Business Machines, Inc. Attn: AmigaDOS 2.0 Upgrade PO Box 651

Holmes, PA 19403

Commodore will then send the customer a coupon entitling them to the AmigaDOS 2.0, when available, plus free installation.

There's more to come from Amiga -- just wait and see. Some of the competition has done their best to put the Amiga down -- throwing the term "game machine" around

It is estimated that current technology will be obsolete in just three years, but if we look at the C-64 you can see that a home computer can last long after technology has moved on. Just as it looks like the end of the 1000 due to advances in the 2000, along comes the aftermarket to provide an upgrade to move the 1000 up to current standard. The same thing will surely happen to the 2000 if and when the time comes. You can buy lots of hardware to enhance the Amiga, lots of games, lots of video equipment, and lots of software. But one must wonder, where is the business software base that the competition enjoys? We have more places to buy Amigas in the form of dealers, even though Commodore has declared war on mail order. There are many new companies making products for the Amiga though we've lost many also. The same can be said for any other brand. The Amiga is a survivor and few products on the market could possibly survive what the Amiga has survived. This should certainly make a point. The Amiga has something that buyers want no matter what other problems there may be. July, 1990 will be the month the 3000 will go on the market, but come the 23rd, take a moment and think a good thought for the Amiga and celebrate 5 years of fun and awesome computer graphics.

## TREASURE TRAP

Underwater Salvage by Electronic Zoo Amiga Review by Barbara Cramer

"Treasure Trap plunges you into the hostile undersea environment of the deep sea treasure diver. You've located the wreck of the gold-laden Esmerelda, and donned the brass diving helmet and canvas suit that keep you alive at 50 fathoms. Making your way through a broken bulkhead door, you enter the sunken wreck and immediately spot the glint of gold and a variety of creatures that protect the long-lost treasure."

While staying alive is your primary concern, you've been hired to salvage the gold from the watery grave of the Esmerelda. It's easy to pick up the gold, all you have to do is touch it. The game will keep track of all the gold you've collected, and even tell you how long it took you to gather it. Sounds easy!

Your strategy and skill to solve puzzles provide the fun and challenge of this game. While your adversaries, jellyfish, eels, crabs, sharks, pirhana, octupi, etc. are ever present, they seldom force you to take fast action and often are the key to solving the puzzle. You are also armed with two "smart fish" at the beginning of the game which devour all harmful creatures in a single room. Additional smart fish are awarded every eighty pieces of gold, a handy feature when you just can't figure another way out.

penalized and are given a chance to see new rooms by using this form of transportation.

Assistance is provided to keep track of your progress in the form of a map accessible to you after just entering any room and rooms are reset to their original formation when you exit and re-enter. Since gravity is not a strong factor, you will also enjoy jumping, floating on objects and occasionally riding on the back of a stingray.

The graphics and sound in Treasure Trap are excellent, executed in true Amiga style and quality. In addition, the initial loading of the game will detect and use expansion memory by creating a RAM disk. This provides faster movement from room to room and virtually no disk access later in the game. Another nice feature is the automatic save option awarded to you every 50 pieces of gold. This makes early game play more enjoyable since you are not stuck on a "level" until you have done it perfectly. You may still wish to go back and re-do a portion to change your path or retrieve a key but I suspect that there is more than one way to solve the entire puzzle.

![Image](1990_07_artifacts/image_000003_2d7a5187b1186d7b10216d3d83b1dc9feda0ee441304e598c5c64fb98bbbad44.png)

The game play is refreshingly slow. After all, you're underwater! The only timing restriction is that of your air supply. Replacement air tanks have been left in various locations throughout the 100+ rooms. In addition, certain doors require special keys that may also be collected during the trip. Since you may only carry three keys at a time you will be forced to make decisions about which keys to carry as well as which direction to travel through the three dimensional maze.

Stuck in one place? Allow one of the whirlpools to touch you and you will be magically transported to another location of the ship. While it is a little risky, you are not

My only complaint with Treasure Trap is the poor joystick control. All the graphics are set diagonally to enhance the 3 dimensional graphics and the joystick controls are set to match. Moving the joystick in the traditional NSEW directions yields no movement at all; only the diagonals work. This makes for awkward control and forced me to use the keyboard arrow keys instead. At first, I found this equally annoying, but soon found that experience taught my fingers to operate the controls with no conscious thought. I even prefer the arrow keys now for their greater precision and flexibility.

All in all, I found Treasure Trap to be a delightful and intriguing game. It has taken me over 21 days of playing it to muster the will to stop! If it weren't for the NL deadline, I would still be playing now. First rate graphics and sound, puzzles and relaxed arcade action... what more could you want?

Treasure Trap requires 512K minimum memory and is designed for the Amiga 500, 1000 and 2000.

## Console Buffer by William J. Fritz

Now don't confuse this with ConMan. ConMan (or Console Buffer. If you don't use ConMan, you should. But

If you are a CLI user I know this has happened to you. You type in a command such as "LIST C:". Before you know it your list has scrolled off the top of the screen so you have to repeat the same command -- and hope that you catch it in time the second try. Console Buffer to the rescue.

the AmigaDOS equivalent, NewCON) provides a command history. I use it in my system all the time along with Console Buffer is different. It saves ALL the console history - both commands and output.

quitting for any reason other than to regain memory.

Here's how it works. To install it in your system, copy the program "CB" to your c: directory and copy the "CB-handler" to the I: directory. Then add the command "CB" to your startup-sequence. (Actually, you can initiate it from the CLI, but you will want it in your startup-sequence.) There are several options available. The most useful is the option to specify the size of the buffer. The default size is 100 lines. By changing the command to "CB -1500", for example, you may specify a buffer of 500 lines. All the options may be changed while the program is running. A couple of useful ones here are "-r" to reset or clear the buffer and "-g" to quit the program although I can't imagine cursor keys. The keys by themselves will scroll a line at a time, the shift with the up or down key will scroll a page at a time, and the Alt with the up or down key will move to the top or bottom of the buffer. Any other key returns you to the normal CLI and automatically re-positions you at the bottom of the buffer.

I can't think of a CLI user who wouldn't love this program. Think of how useful it would be when used in conjunction with SNAP. Console Buffer has worked flawlessly in my system for quite some time now. I have no problems to report and I recommend it highly. Console Buffer is a copyrighted, freely-distributable program. Check it out on MCCC-A\_198.

## SnakePit by Michael Sinz

To review the game briefly, you play a snake. You are turned loose into a maze where you have to eat all the pellets. When you have done so, an exit or exits will open in the side of the maze which will allow you to exit. Until then, there are other problems to face. The main problem is that, as you eat the pellets in the maze, you grow. After a while it becomes quite difficult to keep from bumping into yourself or becoming trapped. To do so means death for Mr. Snake. A simple game right? -- but there is more. There are some (pink) pellets that make you shrink -- and you might shrink away to nothing. Some of the walls can be pushed and moved. This might sound advantageous, and

![Image](1990_07_artifacts/image_000005_af80c94654b6177df85c4c36d3d911f9d682a3e64ffe1e94dbd53e7fe8fade7c.png)

SnakePit is a game that I reviewed for this newsletter a year or so ago. At that time I gave it high marks. Why another review now? Simple. Now you can have it for free. SnakePit has been released as a freely-distributable, copyrighted program. And it gives you one more reason to visit the library at the meeting this month.

But I haven't gotten to how it works yet. When you activate the program a proportional gadget is attached to the right side of your CLI window. When the information scrolls off the top of the screen, all you need do to retrieve it is to click on the gadget with the left mouse button. This activates the buffer. You may now scroll up or down through it using several methods. You can control your position using the mouse on the gadget. The screen is continually updated as you scroll so this method is quite effective to find the desired information. Just as effective is the left mouse button within the CLI window itself. By holding down the left button in the top portion of the window, the buffer will scroll upwards. Likewise, the mouse in the lower portion of the window will scroll downward. The speed is controlled by the position within the window -- the closer to the edge, the faster the scroll. The third method of scrolling is with the up and down

it can be, but it can also form traps quite easily.

Overall, the game is just very well done. You will find yourself playing this game a good deal longer than you intend. And you will come back for more. This one is also available on MCCC-A\_198.

For more variety, there is also a screen editor. When you have mastered the 50 levels included with the game, design some more and then play those.

## Xoper V2.2 by Werner Gunther

Xoper is for the more technically minded. If you have ever wanted to know what your Amiga is REALLY doing but were afraid to ask, this is your chance. Xoper provides a friendly, powerful way to monitor the system's activities. Options are provided to monitor all tasks and processes, to see how much of the CPU's time each is consuming, to see how much CPU is still unused, to see how big a stack each process has allocated and how much is in use, and much, much more.

To a great extent, unless you are a programmer, this is something to satisfy your curiosity. It can, however, be used to your advantage. For example, by looking at some of the stack sizes that were allocated by some of the processes running on my Amiga, I was able to determine that I was setting the stack size too early in my startup-sequence. That is nothing that I couldn't have discovered on my own, but I hadn't noticed it before. It allowed me to free up some wasted memory. I also took a look at the programs I ordinarily run in the background on my system. I noticed that VirusX was consuming more than 30% of my CPU processing power while just waiting for something to happen -- usage was much higher when a disk was inserted -- and remember, I am running a 68030 at 28MHZ.

Obviously, although VirusX is indispensable, it was never written with efficiency in mind. It slows my Amiga down more than I am willing to allow. (The word processor that I am using right now is using only about 10% as I type -- it uses nothing while simply waiting.) As a result, I am now using Virus only when necessary to protect myself from possible viruses introduced by new software.

Xoper might be a way for almost anyone to fine-tune their system. It's copyrighted and freely distributable. Check out MCCC-A\_199 for this one.

## Blackjack Lab by Dan Cogliano

Here are some of the features:

What is there to say about a blackjack game? Assuming that you know the rules, not too much. If you don't know the rules, I will not try to explain them here. What Blackjack Lab provides is a way to practice your game or to just play for fun.

- Up to 7 players -- either robot or human.
- Will monitor your game play if desired and inform you when you make a strategy error.
- Will simulate any casino blackjack game in the world.
- Provides an interactive on-line help facility.
- Has a special practice mode to drill students.

If you like to while away a few hours on games such as this, you will want to give this one a try. The graphics and gameplay are of commercial quality. This version is copyrighted and freely distributable. There is another version available from the author for $25. For the contribution, you receive a version with the save feature enabled, expanded help and several other features. Check

If you haven't yet been exposed to the art work of Rick Parks, you are in for a treat. This fellow is probably the most outstanding artist we have in the Amiga world today. The art is hand drawn and it is remarkable. Included on this disk are several that are required for anyone's art collection. Mickey Mouse Glass is a tumbler, filled with water, and with a picture of Mickey Mouse on it. Several arguments have been started as to whether the picture is digitized, ray-traced or hand drawn. It is hand drawn. Norman is a picture of a fellow hard at work on his Amiga -- based on the famous Norman Rockwell original. And Stymie is just great.

## The HAM-E Graphics System

Amiga Hardware Information From Black Belt Systems Reprinted From the Amiga Zone

(Editor's Note: This article first appeared last January. Lack of space has prevented it from being printed before now, but word has it that this product is about to see the light of day so I thought I had better make room. Since the article is dated, there is the possibility that some information may be incorrect.)

Black Belt Systems is pleased to announce the forthcoming release of our new HAM-E graphics system for all Amigas from the early A1000's, on up to PAL version 2500/030's and all models in between. The HAM-E is inexpensive, extremely compatible, and it offers more performance for your dollar than any other graphics system for the Amiga.

We'll start at the top: The HAM-E provides you with two new graphics modes in addition to all of the original ones you already have in a standard Amiga - and it does so in an extremely compatable and interference free manner.

## REG Mode:

The first mode is 256 simultaneous colors from a palette of 16,777,216 colors (24 bits, 8 bits/gun). Resolutions available are 320x200, 320x400 (interlace), the normal overscan options both horizontally and vertically, and equivalent PAL resolutions. Additional features include the capability to color cycle any or all of the 256 color registers, fully Genlockable, sliding/overlapping front-back screens, no CPU overhead to maintain the image (unless you want to color cycle or glow... and even then it's minimal), completely IFF compatible. You can have 256 levels of grey scale in this mode if you are involved in image processing and so on.

## HAM-E Mode:

The second mode is the Extended HAM (Hold-And-Modify) mode. This mode provides 236 24-bit color registers in four banks of 59, and full 18 bit HAM capability. You can have 262,144 colors on screen at one time (in exactly the same way "standard" HAM allows you to have 4,096) and instead of having 16 color registers available to enhance "fast-edge" color changes, you have 236.... which are accurate to 24 bits (16 million colors). You use this just like you use HAM mode, but you get...

- (1) More than a quarter-million more simultaneous colors than standard HAM mode (or any "normal" Amiga mode) can provide;
- (2) You have much better sharp edge color changes because you have 59 immediately available color registers you can use to load the R, G and B guns with no delay or HAM artifacts to a precision of 24 bits (16 million colors);
- (3) You have the ability to change anywhere in the picture to a new set of 59 color registers - the cost is one pixel that does not change at all from the previous pixel. Obvious "good" places to do that are at the beginning of a scan line, or in an area of an image that is not currently changing (say, the contour of a cheek). Remember, it only takes one pixel and there is no processor overhead involved, no interrupts, no blitter. It's all directly dependant on the pixel data in the image.

The HAM-E mode is Genlockable; it exists on a sliding, front/back standard Amiga screen; it's fully IFF compatible; and supports color cycling of any of the 236 color registers, regardless of bank. Resolutions available are 320x200, 320x400 (interlace), the normal overscan options both horizontally and vertically, and equivalent PAL resolutions.

## Some General Information:

The HAM-E device attaches to any Amiga by simply plugging it into the DB-23 connector that is the RGB port using a supplied cable, and then plugging your monitor or genlock into the other DB-23 connector on the HAM-E. Then you plug it's AC cord into a wall outlet. That's all there is to installation; no need to change your system software in any way, or to add libraries or devices.

The point we're making here is that the new mode images act exactly as if they had been designed into the system from the very start of things.

At this point, you turn your Amiga back on, and use SuperView (or any other show or slideshow utility that understands standard 640 resolution images) to view your first HAM-E images (supplied on a demo disk from us). When you're not viewing an image that uses one of our new modes, for instance, if the WorkBench(tm) is pulled halfway "over" a new mode image, the normal screen (in this example, the WorkBench) looks just as it usually does, and the portion of the new mode image looks exactly as it should also.

One very important difference between the HAM-E product and other, competing display adapters is that our images are maintained in the Amiga's normal "chip" memory, and so you can use the blitter on them; that means that animation and page flipping does not require the direct attention of the CPU... a critical point for those of you using standard animation utilities.

Something else worth noting at this point is that the output from the HAM-E hardware is quality 24 bit RGB (or 12 bit when a normal Amiga screen is showing, and only for the portion that is showing) rather than composite video composite is very difficult to process in many ways, especially for studio work. You can always turn RGB into composite or S-VHS, but not the reverse.

## Some things to keep in mind:

The HAM-E works by operating on the video data coming out of the Amiga RGB port. For this reason, in a system using a flicker-fixer (tm) the new enhanced modes will not be visible on the flicker-fixer's output monitor - only on a monitor connected to the HAM-E. This is a video tool and as such does not at this time support deinterlacing. You can always have both monitors attached, of course.

Think of the output port on the HAM-E hardware as if it were the DB-23 jack on the Amiga; all the same signals are there, on all the same pins, and they work as they always have under the same conditions. For this reason, external genlocks, composite and S-VHS adapters, and monitors all will continue to function normally. It really is as if the Amiga magically "grew" three great new video modes.

Here is a concise list of features for the HAM-E graphics enhancer:

- 256 thousand simultaneous colors on screen, HAM-E mode
- 256 simultaneous colors out of palette of 16 million, REG mode
- Up to 236 directly usable color registers in 8 bit HAM mode
- Complete "color cycling" capability for 59 or 236 color registers
- Both modes can be animated using standard anim type tools
- All color registers are 24 bit accurate (8 bits/color-gun)
- Both Modes are completely IFF compatible
- Both modes supported by existing show and slideshow tools
- Both modes may be overscanned horizontally or vertically
- High rez menuing capability
- Both modes may be interlace or non-interlace
- No "CPU" overhead involved in maintaining the image
- All normal Amiga modes pass thru unaffected
- No "BLITTER" overhead involved in maintaining the image
- Amiga modes are still Genlockable
- Both new modes are Genlockable
- Image memory is BLITTER and CPU accessable
- Works with ALL Amigas - a1000, 500, 2000, 2500, 2500/030, PAL, etc
- Screens are fully "vertical slide", "overlay" &amp; "front/back".
- Attaches to Amiga RGB connecter only - no internal connections
- Externally powered, no load on Amiga system
- Quality RGB output - not composite
- FCC Approved

## Best of all...

- Affordably priced - less than half the cost of other solutions

## About support programs:

enthusiastic and interested, and all have already ordered units from the developer run. Support has been promised for format conversion for the various 24 bit file formats that are out there, and we have barely scratched the surface as of yet.

## Tunnels of Armageddon

## A Winner from California Dreams Amiga Review by Bill Raecke

Tunnels of Armageddon is the latest action game from California Dreams. That's right -- I said the latest. I decided to break my long standing habit and review a piece of software before it gets old and dated sitting on my shelf. Here is the scenario. Science has discovered, from relics located on Mars, that the Earth has, in fact, been visited by beings from another world in times past. Buried beneath the ice of Antarctica lies an abandoned outpost. After digging through the ice, a massive door and a button are uncovered. Pressing the button, the Earth is informed that we are to be welcomed into the galactic community and be given the secret of faster-than-light travel -- but first, a test. In the your stence. yo words of the recording, "If you have sufficiently developed your science, your physical abilities, and your intellect, you should have no difficulties. However, should you be lacking in any of these areas, you are not fit to join us. Advanced technology in the hands of underdeveloped species has nearly destroyed the galaxy in the past."

In other words, when you loose this game, not only do you "get killed", but the entire world is destroyed. BUMMER!

The "test" is, of course, the game. The game consists of a series of tunnels which have to be traveled. When the door to the tunnels is opened, an alarm is triggered. When the alarm reaches the end of the complex, it detonates a device that destroys the Earth. The object of the game is to reach the device and destroy it before the alarm sets it off.

The tunnel complex is arranged as a series of twenty

Between each stage, the game is paused for status reporting and for repairs (which are performed automatically by the aliens). After every four stages (one zone) the pilot is allowed to send information outside the complex (save the game).

difficult it is.

Within the tunnels, various objects will be encountered. You collect them or destroy them by firing at them.

Generators:

When destroyed, they slow down the alarm.

Guardians:

They will cause damage to your craft.

Ammo:

There are two kinds to collect which

improve your firepower.

Energy:

To increase the energy level of your craft. Of obvious use.

Invisibility:

Plasma bomb: More powerful weaponry.

Autopilot:

Helps avoid obstacles.

Superbooster: Turbocharging for your spacecraft.

Force Shield: Destroys all objects in its path.

So much for the background and technical information. As any action game fan knows, what really counts is how it plays. For my money, it's terrific. Although I enjoy a good action game, I'm really not all that good. That means that I want a game that, at least in the early stages, allows me to make progress and to improve my game as I practice and become proficient. Tunnels of Armageddon does just that.

Choose the right or left tunnel

Piloting the craft is rather simple. The tunnels twist and turn, but the craft, being powered by a magnetic field, is naturally repelled by the metallic walls of the tunnels. That means that there is a natural centering action and you won't spend all your time bumping into walls. Actually, you can and will graze walls regularly if you're not careful, but it just slows you a little -- it doesn't cause m a s si ve destruction. The tunnels, broken into five zones of four stages each. Each stage is further broken into a number of smaller segments which allows the pilot to choose between alternate paths. There are three types of paths. Grey are the standard and the longest path. Green is shorter -red is shorter still. But it's not that simple. First, there is only a second or so in which to make a selection. The game is FAST. Second, the shorter the path, the more

## COMMODORE INTRODUCES: THE CDTV PLAYER

## WEST CHESTER, PA JUNE 4, 1990

Commodore International Limited announced the CDTV (Commodore Dynamic Total Vision) Player at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago on Saturday, June

The CDTV Player, which easily connects to any television, stereo system or video monitor, operates a new generation of interactive, multimedia applications on Compact Disc (CD) for education, information, reference and entertainment. The attractively-styled unit is easily operated through a 10-key infrared remote control.

By utilizing the CDTV's advanced capabilities and expansive memory (each disc has more memory than 700 computer diskettes), the CDTV applications are expected to open new dimensions in learning and experience through ease of use, true interactivity, and an innovative mixture of words, graphics, motion, sound and videographic detail.

The CDTV Player will be marketed by Commodore's worldwide consumer sales force, and is planned to be sold later this year through better consumer electronics/audio video departments and specialty stores. It is expected to retail for under $1,000.

Lucasfilm, the Virgin Publishing division of Virgin Records, Cinemaware and other third party developers are scheduled to ship over 100 CDTV application discs this

biggest thing to watch out for are the obstructions that are placed in your path. These appear as black walls which are set out from the sides, top, or bottom of the tunnels. You will need to avoid them by steering around. If you hit one, your craft will bounce back as if from a big rubber mat. A similar thing will happen if you are too slow choosing between two tunnels. When there is a choice of tunnels, they will appear on the right and left in front of you. At the speeds you will be traveling, there will be only a second or so to make a decision for one or the other. If you hesitate, between the tunnels is a wall which you will undoubtedly hit. There doesn't seem to be any damage as a result of these collisions but it seriously slows you down. Remember ** you are racing against that alarm.

Acceleration of the craft is automatic. It is possible to slow it down with the joystick, but no action is required to accelerate to full speed other than avoiding obstacles. This means that before you know it you will be travelling at rates which no sane person would attempt. It makes for a great game.

year. The discs are currently expected to retail around the $25-$60 range.

Key to the CDTV is an innovative blend of CD-ROM technology, the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and Commodore's proprietary multimedia technology currently used in its line of Amiga personal computers. The Amiga is the only computer with out-of-the-box capability to multitask and manipulate video, graphics, animation, music and text.

In addition to various interactive resource materials, a wide variety of instructional programs are planned, in cooking, sports, foreign languages and special learning programs for children. Music, from rock to opera, will be enhanced with videographics, while electronic games will offer significantly more sophisticated depth of play, sound and graphics. The CDTV Player will also run existing CDs featuring music, and music and graphics (CD+G).

Commodore International Limited, through its operating subsidiaries around the world, manufactures and markets personal computers for the professional, home/office and consumer markets and also manufactures and markets information, education and entertainment products for the home. The company has four product lines: Amiga multimedia computers, PC compatible computers, classic C64 computers, and now, CDTV Players.

One more interesting feature. If you complete the game, a new option will appear on the option menu: "Randomize Tunnels". This means that if you complete the game, the next time you play it, it will be different. This should keep it interesting for a long time.

In summary, Tunnels of Armageddon is fast, furious fun. It's challenging without being too difficult to get into. And its randomizing feature will keep it fresh for a long time. The ability to put it on a hard drive makes it one that I will go back to on a regular basis. My recommendation is to buy it. The game is terrific and California Dreams deserves our support.

There is just one more thing that I need to mention the copy protection. There is none. The only protection that the makers have built into the game is a color based code wheel. This means that, unlike most action games, it is possible to put this one on the hard drive. I applaud this step. As a reward, California Dreams needs to make a lot of money on this one.

## CMD Offers 8-bit Hard Drives

## Hardware Update from David J. Kaplan From the New Mexico Commodore User Group Newsletter - DIMensions

Creative Micro Designs Inc. of East Longmeadow, Mass., has introduced three hard-disk drive systems for the Commodore eight-bit series, and the company believes these will lend new life to the computers.

The drives are available in three sizes: 20 Megabytes, 40 Megabytes and 100 Megabytes, and they are priced at $599.95, $799.95 and $1,299.95, respectively. Those figures buy the drive, complete with a case, Commodore serial and power cables and an on-board controller designed specifically for the C64 and C128 computers. The system

has two Commodore serial ports, an auxiliary port, a 25-pin SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) port (handy for owners of other SCSI drives) and parallel port. More about that last later. So, for less than the cost of a C128D and an RGBI monitor, the owner of a Commodore eight-bit computer can obtain the convenience and most of the speed of a hard disk drive for his system.

But wait. There's more. The CMD hard disk drive can be augmented to offer even more speed. The first step is to purchase the most recent version of JiffyDOS, which cuts up to 25 percent off the hard drive's read/load times and up to 45 percent off write/save times. Those who know JiffyDOS are aware that it comes as two chips that replace the DOS ROM in the Commodore 15xx series disk drive and the ROM kernal in the computer. The reductions in disk access time claimed for the JiffyDOS system alone, operating with a 1571 disk drive, are extremely impressive. In fact, the JiffyDOS system, operating on a C128 with a

CMD reports significant improvements in gaining access to and saving programs and data. For instance, according to CMD, a Commodore 1571 drive requires 11 seconds to load and 92 seconds to save a 154 block PRG file, and 31 seconds to read and 82 seconds to write a 125 block SEQ file. According to CMD's data sheet, its hard drive, operating in serial mode, will load that PRG file in 5 seconds and save it in 26 seconds, It took 13 seconds to read and 20 seconds to write the sequential file. The comparisons for handling REL files were about the same. (As should be expected, the 1541 took a little longer to handle its chores than did the 1571. The 1581 was slightly faster at reading and much faster at writing than was the 1571, but the CMD hard drive still was significantly faster.)

1571, in many cases is faster than the CMID hard disk drive (in serial mode) with an unaugmented C128.

A bit of explanation is called for here. Only one bit of data can be passed over a serial connection at one time. It's a little like flashlight batteries that are connected end-to-end -- in series. This is the way Commodore eight-bit computers traditionally have communicated with their floppy disk drives and printers. Using a parallel connection, however, up to eight bits of data, a full byte, can be transterred simultaneously. A parallel connection can be up to eight times faster than a serial connection.

The last item that must be purchased if the user is to take full advantage of the CMD hard disk drive system is called RAMLink. It still is in the prototype stage, to be released sometime this summer. It is used to form a parallel connection between the hard drive and the Expansion Port of the Commodore eight-bit computer (remember that port I said would be discussed later). The RAMLink is reported to have a pass-through connector that will operate perfectly with a RAM Expansion Unit.

So, with the ultimate system from CMD, including the hard disk drive and controller, JiffyDOS and the (prototype) RAMLink, the time required to load and save the above-mentioned PRG file is reduced to 2 and 3 seconds, respectively. For the SEQ file, the read and write times are slashed to 4 and 5 seconds. That's down from 92 seconds for a 1571 to save a PRG file. That is a significant amount of time saved. Bear in mind, however, that all these figures come from CMD. The company did not offer to send out a sample for review purposes, and your author did not pursue the issue.

The system also has an on-board clock that records the time on each file as it is saved. It also sets and checks the clock on GEOS as the user opens new applications.

In later versions, the drive, set between the computer and the printer as it is in most Commodore eight-bit applications, also will be useful as a spooling printer buffer, up to the full capacity of the drive. Users simply will set aside as many 256K blocks of memory as they need and use the auxiliary port as a direct output to the printer. The print spooler will be available in later versions of the operating system.

CMD reports that it has been working closely with Berkeley Softworks to ensure that the system is completely compatible with GEOS for the C64 and the C128. All that is required is the addition of a new configuration file to the GEOS boot disk. It appears, however, that GEOS Will not boot from the hard disk drive, at least not yet.

Charles Christiansen, president of CMD, said in a telephone interview that purchasers would want to keep the serial and RAMILink parallel cables in place at all times as Some programs are not compatible with parallel transfer to a Commodore CPU.

## BrainBlaster

## Two For The Price of One Amiga Review by Harold Williams

Wow, two great games in one package! BrainBlaster (Spotlight Software) comes with Xenon 2, perhaps the ultimate shoot'em up, and Bombuzal, a slick puzzler. Xenon 2 has amazing graphics and sound coupled with frantic action. Xenon 2 was reviewed by Bill Raecke in the February MCCC News. Read his review for details. Bombuzal isn't arcade action, but it is a real mind twister. The game screen consists of a grid covered with bombs. The object of the game is to explode all the bombs... without exploding your cute cartoon style character. There are several types of bombs, dissolving tiles, slick ice tiles, and mean nasties scattered about to make your job harder. Occasionally there are helpful little droids and teleportation chambers to make your job easier. You also work against a clock. After successfully completing a few levels you are given a password to allow you to restart the game at that level instead of the beginning. You are given a choice of playing in 2-D or 3-D mode. Because the play field is larger than the screen you can also bring up an overhead view map of the entire grid. The box claims 120 levels, the instructions don't mention the number of levels. While exploring the files on the disk (I was hoping to hack a hard drive installation) I found what would appear to be 256 levels. The first few screens are fairly easy, but they keep getting harder. If you're looking for something to strain your brain give this game a try. Xenon 2 comes on two copy protected disks. Bombuzal is not copy protected. Both of these games are going to keep me real busy for a long time.

Note: Bombuzal came with a boot block virus on the disk. After finding and removing the virus (thank you Virus!) I contacted the dealer. They checked other copies and found that all were infected. The distributor is also aware of the problem. There should be no infected Bombuzal disks left on the shelves.

There is a switch on the back of the drive case that allow the user to operate it as drive O or drive 1, devices 8 or 9. To make matters even better, as the CMD drive is a SCSI system, up to seven more SCSI drives may be daisy-chained to it without having to add another controller. The total capacity of all these drives can be up to 4 gigabytes.

On April 11, NMCUG member Terry Riley received the CMD 20-megabyte drive he'd ordered from East Longmeadow. With a great big grin, he reports that the system is so fast, even in serial mode, that it's almost as fast as his RAM Expansion Unit. He said the company plans a major upgrade quite soon that will add a number of new features, such as subdirectories similar to those on the

## Spherical

## A Great Puzzle Game Amiga Review by Harold Williams

If you enjoy games like, MindRoll, Prospector, PocoMan, or NeverMind then here is another terrific puzzler. The idea is fairly simple. You guide a rolling sphere to a specific block of stone. You have twenty seconds at the start of each screen before the sphere begins to roll. During this time you must establish a correct path for the sphere by adding or removing stone blocks. Another strategy is to block the path of the sphere within the twenty seconds and then build the correct path without worrying about the clock. You will encounter a variety of magic items that can help you complete the task. There are also a few nasties around that will try to hinder your progress.

## "The graphics are outstanding (the high score screen is simply amazing). The music is also great"

There are 100 screens to solve in the one player mode and an additional 100 screens for two players. The two player mode is cooperative, not competitive. The graphics are outstanding (the high score screen is simply amazing). The music is also great. You can select from six different tunes or just listen to the game sounds. There is a practice mode to allow you to get the feel of the joystick before beginning the game. The joystick control is a little tricky and practice helps. Although you cannot select individual screens to play, you will occasionally find a screen with a document that contains a code word that teleports you directly to a screen.

Unfortunately Spherical comes on a copy protected disk. It cannot be installed on a hard drive. You can make a backup with Project D. Spherical is a winner. Go for it!

Amiga; the ability to switch partitions from the front panel of the drive (something like switching disks electronically); and provisions for additional open files, up to 16 open simultaneously on the hard drive (a multi-tasking hard drive?).

If this system from CMD does what has been claimed, it will be a long-overdue addition to the Commodore stable. Serious users of West Chester's computers generally have been left out of the hard disk drive revolution that began after the introduction of the IBM PC. It's about time somebody realized that more than 11 million Commodore eight-bit computers have been sold - a large potential market for hard drives.

Well, here we are halfway through the year and growing strong. We have just moved into our new meeting place in the North Richland Hills Community Center and we play it back on his electronic keyboard. We appreciate Mark for putting together all our programs every month. If you have a suggestion for a presentation, I'm sure he would be happy to try to set it up.

## Thanks To The Makers of PageStream

The MCCC recently received a special User Group Pack from Soft-Logik Publishing Corporation, the makers of PageStream. The package contained two copies of PageStream V1.8 and a demo copy of PageStream. Those of you who have been members of the club for more than a few months know by now that | am an avid user of PageStream. It is the package that I use (along with PixelScript) to produce this newsletter. I consider it to be far superior to the competition. This donation serves to strengthen my commitment to this excellent product.

the external floppy drive. Scott Lamb brought us up to date on the new CDTV CD-ROM system and discussed some of the new applications being developed for this revolutionary product. Other new products mentioned included Amiga-Vision, the new Amiga 500c and 500p models, GVP 68030 50Mhz upgrades, HAM-E video enhancement adaptor (256,000+ colors at once!) and more.

As to the disposition of the packages that we received, be sure to attend METCOM*90. You now know what two of the doorprizes will be. As to the demo version -- be on the lookout for it in the library. It functions just like the regular version except that it will not save and the word "PageStream" will be printed diagonally across your printed output.

We wish to thank Soft-Logik for their generous support of the MCCC and for developing PageStream in the first place.

new. Great demo Ray!

Following the Q&amp;A session we were given an in-depth demonstration of the incredible ARexx language by Ray Howard. ARexx is part of the new 2.0 AmigaDos and Ray gave us a hands-on demonstration of how to put this powerful tool to use. His examples were geared to both the novice and expert so everyone there learned something

Mark your calender now for our next meeting when we will be featuring a real multimedia show with Amiga Vision, complete with stereo and an Amiga controlled Video subsystem OR a new hardware product demonstration by Applied Engineering. Don't miss it!

I know my husband and I raced for the Amiga when we got home (he won), and tried out some of the effects she showed us. After exhibiting samples of output via color printers and photography, we were treated to "slide shows" of various works she had created with DPaint III (mostly low-res interlace mode). She also discussed different means of displaying your finished masterpiece,

"Crowd Control Graphics"! She certainly had OUR attention on the screen. I'm still not sure how she got the puppy's tail to wag... We hope she will come back and show us more! (ANIMATION!)

We also heard an update on the programming SIG soon to form, and they hope to have special guests at their meetings when time and place have been set up. Our Shareware contributions for the evening were for a product called QMOUSE, by Lyman Epp. It's a mouse accelerator (lots of portant soldering iron. Stressing safety as the foremost criteria, he presented a multitude of tools and the proper, and improper, ways of using them. He also included the fact that sometimes processes other than soldering are more appropriate under some conditions. We would like to extend our gratitude to Bill.

Then the "demo" began, as Marilyn created "3-D" pottery with a single wiggly line, and produced a kaleidoscope of changing "spirograph" images variables), a screen- and pointer-blanker, a hot key tool, and a clock, and seemed to be very nifty. There were several door prizes this time! Thanks to our contributors, Metropolitan, Amazing, and all. Our next meeting should be in the same place, same time, on July 18th, 7:30! See you there!

## Arlington/Grand Prairie Eddie Allen

Due circumstances beyond our control, we were unable to have the telecommunications demonstration that was scheduled. It looks like we should be able to have it in the July meeting.

Bill Glenn, an LTV electronics wizard, filled in on short notice. He gave us the whys and wherefores of the process of wielding the all im- place, since the library informed us that their meeting room policy was being changed from free to non-profit organizations to $15 an hour. We all agreed to try to locate a facility.

## Fort Worth Ellen Triplett

Since our May meeting was delayed until after the final date for receiving the columns for the newsletter, this will be a combination of our May and June reports.

In May we discussed the need to change our meeting

Our chapter librarian mentioned several useful disks in the library (including #256 which contains some additional commands for use with #543 - Speed Script 3.0). He also said #509 needs some changes made in order to use it. Hopefully someone with more expertise than I have will correct this and tell the rest of us.

Rich Meyer suggested using a listing on the OUTSIDE of the sleeve, since acid in the paper when placed directly on the floppy disk may eventually damage it.

Mary Louise gave us a short program to print directory listings also a line to move over and not waste the right side of the page.

We had two guests at this meeting - Patrick Kruzel and Mark Howell.

Our program consisted of various demonstrations of spreadsheets. John from simple PD slide shows to full-blown multi-media packages with sound, titling, etc. We heard about some of the problems inherent in going screen-to-paper, like translating the Amiga colors to HP printer colors (you have to do some wierd palette manipulations to get the hard copy to look like the screen, sometimes), film and developing problems (Metropolitan will let you buy time

Sookma used Planner's Choice for the 64 or the 128.

Incidentally, at our June 9th meeting, Rich informed us that he has accepted a job (in another state, if I am remembering correctly) and therefore must resign the presidency of the Ft. Worth Chapter. He will be sorely missed. John Sookma will assume Rich's position and that of vice-president will need to be filled.

James Dunnam set his for Time Works Swift Calc for the 128, and Rich Meyer for Swift Calc Sideways for both 64 and 128.

Also, the club will be needing a new Education Officer (another of Rich's contributions of work).

At the June 16th meeting of the HEB Chapter, discussions ranged from copying disks to how to use the bulletin board. We talked about Version 6.0 of JiffyDos and how much better it is than the last version. This was a very informative meeting.

James Dunnam gave us several names of programs for squeezing or crunching files to save time, space, and/or money:

File SDA (Self Dissolving - after loading)

File LNX (LYNX - another archival system - will do copying, etc.)

File ARC (Unpacks files - will compress or uncompress)

File LBR (Library - pack down or unpack)

File SID MUS (will dissolve any of the above

Mary Louise gave us a list of instructions on debugging a program:

1. If a line is mentioned, ask for it.
2. Ask it to print.
3. Make changes and try again.
4. Type in RUN and a line #.
5. Slow by control button.
6. Add STOP line or TEMPORARY line information (to be removed before final copy).
7. Do not accidentally bypass

The next meeting will be held on July 21st at the Hurst Recreation Center at 1:30 p.m. It will be similar to this last meeting, called an "Open Forum". Ask any questions you may have about disks or your computer here. Bring whatever it takes to help answer your questions.
