The big news this month is that the MCCC Bulletin Board is operational. For those of you who have already signed up and have been using it for a month, this may no longer be big news.

First I want to thank all the people who organized its creation and those who are playing an on-going role in its operation. The committee responsible for all the initial research, set-up and sysop selection consisted of Dayid and Alice Rye, Roger Hoggard, Mary Louise Hageneyer, and Paul Robinson. It was a lot of work end they did an excellent Job. Nent are Aaron Hightower and Craig Smith who are responsible for writing the terminal program we are now using. I don't think anyone could have asked for a more well written progran. Our System-Operator is Okley Moss and Aaron Hightower will be assisting. To Okley and Aaron, our thanks. Their work is just thanks Thei beginning. A special thank you is also due to the charter members who have been exceptionally patient and understanding.

I also want to include a few lines explaining what our BBS will offer for those of you who have not yet signed up. Very simply, a BBS is a way for computer owners to communicate with each other. You are able to send and receive messages to and from everyone (Messages) or to and from one specific person (E- Mail or Electronic Mail). On most- Bulletin Boards you are also able to upload (send) prograns to the system and to

BILL RAECKE

download (receive) programs. On our BBS we have Message capabilities and E-Mail. We also allow people to download public domain programs from the system disk. This is one more way to get programs from the library. Also the BBS will provide a list of club officers and their phone numbers as well as a list of meeting times and places for the various chapters. (A good way to find meeting times if the post office holds up your newsletter). I also intend to post special bargains on hardware and software which are made available to user groups from time to time. Until the BBS, there was no way to let everyone know when these offers were available - now there is.

I hope this article has helped answer some of the questions you may have had about the BBS. If there are more please feel free to ask me or any club officer. We are glad to help.

In closing I just want to say that no matter how practical we might:. make the BBS sound land it is practical) the main attraction is that its just plain fun!!

Graphics in this newsletter were drawn using Doodle! and The Print Shop. Typesty les were created using FontMaster, a new word processing program by Xetec.

## MCCC BBB

by David Bye

MOOC Computerized Bulletin Board System 1s operationing! This article is a brief review containing some hints on its use.

## THE TERMINAL PROGRAM

The system is a color/graphics program written by MOCC members, Aaron Hightower and Steve Craig. The color and graphics available make the system great fun while being yery useful. It's fun to send &amp; letter with a "crazy cursor", different colors in text and ringing bells!

terminal disk is provided to each BBS ember to access all the capabilities of the system. This disk contains the terminal (moden) program and a "create new user" program which is used to make a SYSTEM disk. The System disk is required to log onto the BBS. This has actually made logging on quite simple. The first time you log on, some information 1s verified and then you never have to remember a password again. The terminal program will also work with any other Commodore BBS as well.

The terminal program will be updated later with additional features as they are available or required. A new program will be available for download on the BBS OF through the club library.

The program commands are accessed through the function keys in the following manner.

F1 - Sends a file

F3 - Receives a file

- F4 - Access buffer commands of (O)pen, (C) lose, (E)rase, (S)ave or (P)rint to screen
- F5 - Disk commands (To format, scratch, initialize, reset, etc.)
- F6 - reads YOUR disk directory
- F7 - shows a menu AND switches between &amp; Graphics Terminal (for our BBS) or ASCII terminal for others systems.

you want.

The terminal program allows disk functions and has a large buffer in which to store your data. The buffer can be later displayed on screen or saved on a disk. The present version does not provide for printer output so a word processor or seq. file reader program is required for hard copy on your printer.

No autodialer is available at present 50 manually dialing is required. The system has been tested successfully with the Commodore 1600 and 1650 modens as well as the Westridge and Telelearning modens. Additional modems will be checked out as soon as possible.

Overall, I found the terminal program quite user-friendly. An autodialer would be nice but they differ for each modem type used. Another needed feature is sending the buffer to a printer.

## THE BBS ITSELF

When you log onto the system you are greeted with a CLOR welcome screen. You are the instructed to leave your SYSTEM disk in your drive without a write protect. The logon Will normally be fully automatic from that point.

Information may be shared in several ways on the BBS. Personal mail can be sent between members using E-mail. General information may be made available to ALL by using the Message Base. Information may be sent to the system operator via Feedback, E-mail, or Chatting with him online (when he is available).

The messages may be sent as pure text or color graphics with bells. The graphics are fun, but if you expect the receiver to print out the information on a printer, regular text is preferred. The system begins in regular text. To access the color/graphics capabilities, enter CTRL-O. This turns off word wrap and turns ON the graphics. (The CTRL-O requirement was not clear to me at first so please make a note of it.) It is FUN to send a PRETTY letter with bells ringing!

I recommend that you review the message base regularly to see what is new with the club as well as instructions or changes to the BBS or Terminal programs.

Program downloads are available which send the program directly to whatever disk you have in your drive. Just select download and the you will be given a choice of programs you may receive. Tell the which one you want and when the tells you to begin receiving press F3 and enter the name of the file again. The two computers then take over and tell you when thay are finished. Try it with a blank, formatted disk to get the feel of it. You can't hurt anything that way so relax and enjoy.

More information Will be provided later so stay tuned and check the BBS for the latest news, gossip, programs and fun!

The membership cost 1s pro-rated for the rest of the year. Join now. Charter members will be offered a significant discount for 1936.

## BUTTERFELD UTILITY

By Tony Velaz

Do you have a lot of disks full of different types of programs that you would like to consolidate by your own requirements? Transferring each file one by one (first loading then saving to another disk) takes a lot of time.

There are several commercial programs available to make this task easy, however, the club library has a very good program called Unicopy, written by Jim Butterfield that will transfer files easily. And, Unicopy is FREE to members.

There are 3 items you willneed to know to use Unicopy correctly, 1- Resident programs are Dos Wedges or anything that many take up memory. So be sure to turn off your computer before loading unicopy. This will give you up to 48k of tranfer space. 2-The '*' is a wild card. If you want to check all the files hit return at the "*" prompt. If you want only certain files like the ones that start with a "D", type "d*" over the "*" prompt. This will only load those files that start with a "D". 3-The disk that you are going to transfer to MUST be for-matted. If you have any problems please call and I will be happy to help.

Permission to reprint given by author.

Moxe on FIRSTTERM: Let's continue our exploration of the finer points of that great public domain terminal program, FIRSTTERM. Hopefully, you've tried the features we reviewed last month.

Programmable function keys can make your on-line sessions a real joy. A series of characters, sometimes called "macros", are transmitted at the touch of a key, saving you time, keystrokes, and the aggravation of correcting botched messages typed by hand. The assigned characters are typically passwords, frequently used commands to speed and simplify your electronic navigations, or some other ilessages (such as "HELD" or "Are you still there, dummy? "&gt; which are convenient when chatting with friends. A more subtle, but valuable use of this feature, is to assign modem conmands, such as automatic dialing sequences, to the keys, thus permitting full use of many standard modems, such as the Hayes series. FIRSTTERM offers you a total of 16 programmable function keys, plus a security option as an added bonus.

Here's how to implement FIRSTTERM's function key assignments. From the main menu, choose option E (Examine/Alter Function Keys. ) The program will then prompt you for a password; don't panic. The default is "64", so enter this for now. Once you gain access to the function key screen you can change the password by pressing "p" and following the prompts. Why have a password? That's part of the security bonus! You see, several function key assignments may be confidential, such as secret passwords or ID numbers. If you are demonstrating an on-line session for your friends, or if someone else will be using your program ( e.g. your employees during business applications) you probably don't want them to know, or change, confidential information. However, can still use the F key assignments without knowing what they are, as you will see

## BOF THARE REYIEH Courtesy of Babbage's

## THE GREAT AMERICAN CROSS COUNTRY ROAD RACE-ACTIVISION

Activision Software has done it again. ROAD RACE isn't just another car race game although at first glance that's what it appears to be. The game will take you through 25 United States cities. You choose the route from several choices and then away you go.

The Great American Cross Country Road Race is Activision's best recent effort and certainly gives Commodore owners another exciting game to enjoy!

During the game you will have to make split second decisions. The weather can get rough. Snow, fog, ice and rain make driving hazardous and your performance. You must plan your routes accordingly. Highway conditions vary greatly. Lane closures, road work or even oil slicks mean trouble, so you'll really need to keep your eyes open. Speed traps seem to pop up when you least expect them. You can either mind your speed limit or if you're daring, make a run for it. Make sure you watch your gas guage. An empty tank means you will need to push your car -the next gas station. This will obviously have disastrous effects on your time. Rush hour around cities can be a nightmare. Try and plan your arrivals and departures to avoid costly jam-ups. Maximum RPM is around 9,500. When shifting gears, don't push to hard, or you will blow out the engine. The time to begin the Iace is as critical as any part of the game. Starting at the wrong hour may mean winding up on an icy road in the middle of the night.

## THANK YOU, BOF-TEX

The MCCC would like to express our thanks to Roger Hoggard of Sof-Tex for servicing and repairing club equipment at no charge. Roger's excellent workmanship and continuing generosity have played a major role in the snooth operation of many club activities which are easily taken for granted.

The 16 programmable keys are the usual F keys, alone shifted with the "SHIFT", "CTRL" and Commodore logo keys. At the function key screen, press the F key or shifted F key of your choice and follow the prompts. Be aware that there two limitations to an F key designation; you can use no more than 28 characters and you cannot (from the key-board) give it control codes. The program simply ignores excess keystrokes, as well as keys typed in combination with the CTRL key. However, you can evade the control code limit by temporarily earmarking easily recognized "dummy" characters to your target keys. For example, if you wish to Control-d to F1, start by assigning it the letter "A". Then, save all program parafile editor to find the "A" and change it to whatever control code (in our example chr$(1)) you choose. Finally, reload the to FIRSTTERM and modify other saveable parameters as needed, making sure not to change the F key which has the control code; procedure is cumbersome but practical for someone determined to assign that control code.

The program lets you append a return character to an F key string, and kill of keep its screen echo. Confidential material should not, of course, be echoed. At first, the echo option might seem unnecessary because most on-line hosts don't display passwords anyway. However, unless the program itself censors your message, someone could mischievously trot off- line in half-duplex and press the various F keys to read their contents; he or she would not even have to know the password to the function key assignment screen. With echo surpression, one could send but not read F key text. By the way, in case you forget which messages have echo supression or which end in carriage returns, the display chart of the F key brackets surpressed text with bar and appends a bracketed carriage return notation as applicable.

key strings/password, along with communications parameters, screentext colors, and the phone number direc tory, can be saved to disk for later retrieval by using the main menu option F. Thus, you can prepare customized FIRSTTERM files for different correspondents. FIRSTTERI

Control codes, frequently used for various purposes in telecommunications, have to do with such housekeeping chores as signaling your host to stop, pause or resume a message, ring a bell or drop the cursor. The ASCII pause symbol, for example, is Control-S (ASCII value 19). FIRSTTERM honors most control codes in standard way. One exception is Control-T, Device Control 4/value 20 in true ASCII parlance, which FIRSTTERM treats as ASCII 8, a backspace. Try it. As we reviewed in last month's column, in terminal mode, off-line/half-duplex, hold down the CTRL key and hit "t"; the outgoing character code on the status line will still be 008. While this situation is normally insignificant, someone did encounter a BBS that required CONTROL-T as a log on flag; the special F key assignment procedure described above was no help because FIRSTtranslated chr$ (20) to chr$(8) before sending the character; can't win them all!

Despite the CONTROL-T limit, FIRSTTERM conveniently supports several additional codes. In terminal mode, pressing the STOP key sends ASCII pause (chr$ (19)); CTRL-: sends escape (chr$(27)); CTRL - British pound sends chr$(28), ASCII file separator; CTRL - up arrow yields chr$130), record separator: the unit separator, chr$(31) is produced by CTRL-=.

FIRSTTERM can also send and receive several other standard ASCII characters that typical terminal prograns simply cannot: the left arrow sends underline; shifted "+" sends the left curly bracket;

Control codes are normally not shown on a screen. However, FIRSTTER has the unique option of displaying most of them, as reversed video letters. deactivate this feature, in terminal mode, hold down the Commodore key and press "d". The status line "D" goes reverse video when the option is on. Try it loffline/half-duplex); then hold down the CTRL key and hit "a"; a reverse video "A" will appear. Hit CTRL-G, the "bell" character. Try CTRL- M; a reverse M is not shown because this code, a carriage return, affects the screen display itself. Turn the option off (Commodore-d again) and press CTRL-a once more; nothing shows up this time, but the character out code reads 001 showing that Control- A was, indeed, transmitted.

shifted "-" produces a right curly brack-

et. Try the up arrow by itself to generate · circu. The British pound sign yields a backslash.

This review has by no means covered all of the program's facets. However, I hope that by now you can appreciate some of its more subtle points so you can get the most from FIRSTTERM.

Literally years of waiting, Corndore announced the Amiga computer on July 24.

It really does. You want graphics? You got em. Sound? That too. Speed? Faster than an IBM-AT. Power? It's multitasking. Expandability? Up to 8 megabytes of memory. Price? Cheaper than the other players in the major leagues.

Let's put it plain and simple: is the most spectacular computer Commodore has ever made. This new machine shines with a pretty blinding light.

Here's what the Amiga is: A box that looks more like an IBM-PC than anything CBM has put out in the past. There's a detached keyboard with cursor keys, numeric keypad, function keys, the works. You get a mouse. Alao, a built-in 3.5" disk drive that stores B8OK.

What goes on inside the box is more exciting than the outside appearance. Here is where the Amiga pushes the state-of-the art. The heart of the computer is a 68000, same 32-bit processor that drives Apple's Macintosh and many UNIX-based computers. It directly access the 256K of built-in RAM. An additional 256K can be plugged into a slot on the front of the machine, and a total of 8K could be accessed directly yia an outboard memory box.

With a clock speed of 8mhz, Amiga 1s blindingly fast - faster than the

Mac or the PC. Better still, all of this computer's spectacular graphics work is handled by three amazing custom integrated circuits. The 68000 processor just them some instructions, which they then execute on their own without further help.

What this gives you is the ability to generate pictures in 320*200 resolution and your choice of 32 colors, selected from over 4000%!), then animate those drawings without slowing the computer down. You can divide the screen up into as many as 50 windows and move around between them. Intuition, the Amiga's operating system burned into its chips, 16 designed to let you perform multitasking - doing two lor more) things at once.

The Amiga sound circuits provide stereo audio, with two voices in the left speaker and two in the right. Each voice is the equivalent of a SID chip in it's own right, meaning 12-part harmony will be possible.

The audiovisual capabilities mean the Amiga should find a good niche in the home market. The speed, memory. and sophisticated operating system capabilities mean the Aniga could outrun most business machines.

Which leaves the price. $1295 is not cheap, but for a machine which can do things no other machine can do, it seems reasonable.

It's coring to a store near you before Christmas.

There is going to a a LOT of press coverage of this computer in the next few months lin fact, there's going to be a whole magazine devoted exclusively to it starting this month). But while you read the same old facts reeled over and over again, here are some other things to consider.

- 1) This is the first CBM computer that people from the'real world' (read: IBM and APPLE) are paying heed to. Consultants and industry pundits arepraising this machine, and seem genuinely excited by it. Which is great - CBM needs all the respectability it can get.
- 2) Note how many of the Amiga's features come standard. This was a very smart move. An IBM-PC can display more colors on-screen IF you have the proper adapter... but how many people have it? On

the Amiga, *everyone* has 256K, all the colors, all the sound, the mouse and the multitasking.

- 3) Speaking of multitasking...it will be interesting to see what this feature could do for the home. Finally we have a machine that can monitor the house energy consumption, simultaneously call Startext for local news and weather, AND play a game of "SkyFox" - at the sane time!

And Commodore is indeed thinking about television, since the Amiga already contains about half the hardware to display and overlay television pictures on top of computer-generated graphics.

- 4) You can have up to 32 colors on the screen at once. These are selected from a total range of 4096(!). While the idea of painting with whole ranges of colors instead of only a few garish primary hues is enticing, the idea that we can use 32 shades of gray also has appeal. This is a sufficient gray scale to produce photographic (or television-) quality realism.

Two final questions are less exciting, but also interesting.

- 1) Will the shine of the Amiga dim the luster of the C128? I have no definitivie answer--but yes it could. The C128 could end up in the same unenviable position as the the Plus-4 did when the 128 itself was introduced: being a poor cousin. Against moder the thoroughly modern Amiga, the C128 looks a bit stale, like yesterday's news. On the other hand, the $1000 price difference between the two machines counts for something, too.
- 2) Finally - In today's computer market, can the Amiga make it? Some think it's too high-priced for a home computer. Others think business will shy away from a computer made by Commodore. Still others worry because the machine is incompatible with anything else on the market.

For myself, I think the Amiga will succeed, and spectacularly. Ultimately, innovation - and this machine has it ALWAYS wins out in the end.

It has been several months since we published the disk directories in our newsletter but this month we have had quite a few additions to the library. I cannot review all the disks since they have so many different types of programs on each. However, there are several that I would like to comment on. They are listed by their MOCC numbers.

- #261 - This is another music disk and it includes the following songs: The Gambler, We Are The World and The Theme from 2001.
- #412 &amp; 413 - Both disks are full of machine language routines and programs.
- #264 - A utility package by Bob Lawson that includes a fast and userfriendly sort routine.
- #525 - This is a computer literacy disk which defines many of the BASIC keywords and also includes an ER-SCRIPT tutor.
