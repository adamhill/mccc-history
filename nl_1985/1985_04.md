## PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

Anyone who has had Commodore equipment for any length of time has found themselves frustrated at one time or another with the lack of customer support offered by Commodore. We have also found ourselves frustrated by the lack of exciting new equipment. Well, it's hard to believe, but that seems to be changing.

First, Commodore has announced that they are forming a network of 1500 service centers throughout the country. Rumours have it that these will be established using Sears stores and RCA service centers. No longer will we have to wait three weeks for a new piece of equipment when we have problems. On the minus side, I have heard that they are also discontinuing the exchange/replace policy through their main office, 50 before you send your equipment backy call them first.

Commodore has established user group support system. The main thrust of their effort thus far 15 newsletter which includes nothing more · than advertising for Commodore

equipment and a questionnaire to be returned to Commodore. But maybe it will improve. In the meantime, perhaps a little customer input in the form of that questionnaire will help Commodore to know just what we really want in future products and will prevent disasters like the C16 and the Plus/4.

As for new equipment, we are all anxiously awaiting the arrival in the stores of the C128. Finally, a new Commodore product that we can 10ok forward to. I was beginning to think that. they had used up all their creative powers with the C64. Imagine a machine that will run all existing C64 software and which will also offer the 129k mode with 123k Basic space available and a CP/M mode. The C128 is sitting in local warehouses right now, with a price tag of #249 waiting for the word from Commodore to release it. And along with the C128 they have also announced a new LCD lap computer, a 1902 RGB monitor, a 1571 double sided fast disk drive. a 1572 dual disk drive, and a new 300/1200 BAUD modem.

Only time will tell if the new equipment and attitude lives up to our expectations, but right now it seems like Christmas.

## LOVE AT FIRST BYTE

BY LARRY GROEBE

Therg" = c1 d stor/ about three blind men and an elephant. None of these wise old gentlemen had never seen elephant before, and they travelled to a village to visit one. When they returned they were asked to describe what kind of creature they had encountered.

The first man had been shown the elephant"e tail. He thought that an elephant was like a length of rope. The second blind man had felt the elephant's leg, He claimed the beast was more like a sturdy tree trunk. And the third man had touched only the elephant's ear. and adamantly proclaimed that the first two gentlemen WErE wrong. and an elephant was REALLY more like a large prehistoric bird.

I was reminded of this story the other day when someone having heard I WaS supposed to be an expert of sorts regarding Commodore computers asked my opinion cf some the local dial-up bulletin boards.

I WES stumped. I never ever call bulletir boarde" My modem is used exclusively call Startext and Compuserve, and I've rarely had any real interest in Pur SU1ng any other on-line opportunities.

And that got me to thinking: the CL4 is like an elephant, and we are all blind men. My Commodore is like typewriter when I use i.t for word processing. It becomes like an orchestra when 1 play MUE1 C. on it. On the other hand, to some close friends who don't write. the computer ·15 an artist's palette. To SOME others WhO don"t caint, it'e a link to the news of the wor1d. Widely different things to different people.

What other item in your house DE that wai? Your computer can be like a file cabinet. a murder mystery stori, аг accountant. a ride at Six Flags. a tolerant teacher, and a starpi sky on a clear night. A nearly universal machine.

The problem COMeS when WE LSOr3 act like those three blind men. refusing to accept other possibilities just because the: ma: be outside our first-hand experience. Many people I

see scorn certain applications for their Commodore, and it's usually because they themselves just aren't interested in them. Nuts. There's ultimately no such thing as a trivial or unimportant computer application. If you are using your 64 or PET or VIC for just one or two tasks. then you sure are missing out on something.

Try something new with your machine. Pay attention to what someone else does with theirs. Expand your knowledge of what that computer can do. And keep an open mind. You'll be amazed.

As for myself, I'm going to do the same...and I'm going start by calling up some local bulletin boards.

## C64 HINTS &amp; HELPS

COMPILED BY BILL RAECKE

## GENERAL INFORMATION

## Роне 646

This location controls the color of the printed characters. It works as does the poke 53290 and poke 53281 commands do in controlling border and screen color respectively, Its value can be O to 15 representing the 16 odore colors. text colors may also be controlled using print statements but this location can be useful to determine the current text color being used.

## SYS 64738

This command causes the computer to reset all pointers to their normal start-up values. (cold start).

## POKE 51.L: POKE 52,HE POKE 55IL: POKE 56, HE CLR

This series of conmands sets the top of basic memory. L represents the low byte and H represents the high byte of thememory address.

## POKE 45uL: POKE 44, H: POKE XXXXx, 01

This series of commands sets the bottom of basic memory. L represents the low byte and H represents the high byte of the memory address. When establishing a new starting location for basic, a zero must be poked to the location immediately preceeding the new start point.

## POKE 55270, 0x

A series of pokes to this location will cause the screen to move from side to side. To return screen to normal, POKE 53270,200.

## PEEK 156320): PEEK (56321)

These locations store the values of joystick 2 and 1 respectively.

![Image](1985_04_artifacts/image_000014_dbf61714656f07c704fef2f681baea2edbe91e633b0cd07c97db2349c5954fd1.png)

## POKE 53265, PEEK (53265) 1 and 239

This command will blank the screen and make it appear to be the same color as the border. The screen may still be written to, but it will not be visible. normal computer operations are speeded up. POKE 53265, PEEK (53265)or16 to reset screen.

## OFEN " 8, "s "Orfile name, 5, a"

The "a" in the above command stands for "append" "Append" is available in addition to the "read" and "write" explained in the 1541 manual. This command allows data to be added to the end of an existing sequential file from within a normal basic program. The 1541 dos will automatically locate the end of the file when this command is used and the normal print#x will then cause additional data to be added at that point.

## KEYBDARD INFORMATION

## PRINT CHR$ (14)

This statement will switch to the lower case character set.

## BRINT CHR$ (1422.

This statement will switch to the upper case character set.

## PRINT CHR$ (8)

This statement will disable the Commodore/shift key combination thus preventing the selected character set from being changed via the keyboard.

## PRINT CHR$ (9)

This statement will enable the Commodore/shift key combination.

## POKE 198.;

This location indicates the number of characters located in the kevboard buffer. The value can be from o to 10. To clear the keyboard buffer, poke a zero to this location.

## POKE 631 xx to 640xx

This is the keyboard buffer. The ASCII value of any key may be poked to these locations to simulate a keyboard entry. Note: The number of keys being simulated must also be poked to location 198 (see above).

## POKE 788,52: POKE 808,239

These pokes will disable the stop key.

## POKE 788,49: POKE 908,237

These pokes will enable the stop key.

## POKE 793,203

This poke will disable the restore key.

## POKE 56:25.x

This memory location controls the speed of the cursor. Lower numbers result in a faster cursor. The normal value is 58.

## POKE $50,x

This memory location controls the key repeat function. Poke a 128 to cause all keys to repeat. Foke a $4 to disable all repeating keys. Poke a 0 to reset the repeating keys to their normal values (space bar and cursor keys repeat).

## POKE 649,x

This memory location controls the size of the keyboard buffer. Its value may be in the range 0 to 10. Poke a zero to disable the keyboard. Poke any other number to specify the number of keyboard strokes which may be stored in the buffer. The normal value for this location is 10. Never poke a number greater than 10 to this location.

## PEEK (653)

This location is used to detect if the SHIFT, CTRL, or Commodore key is pressed. The SHIFT key will set the value to 1, the Commodore key will set the value to 2, and the CTRL key will set the value to 4.

## POKE 781,x: POKE 782, Y: POKE 783, PEEK {783) AND 254: SYS 65520

These commands will position the cursor at a specified location on the screen. Values of 0 and 0 for x and y axes respectively will position the cursor in the upper left hand corner of the screen.

## POKE 783, PEEK (783) OR1: SYS65520: R=PEEK (781) : C=PEEK (782)

These commands will find the current position of the cursor on the screen. "R" will contain the row and "C" will contain the column.

## DISÉ DRIVE INFORMATION

## LOAD "$1"8.

This directory command will return the disk name and blocks free without listing all the files.

## LOAD "$:*=X",8

This directory command will return only the specified file tpe. The x may be replaced by a "P" for Program Files, an "S" for Sequential Files, an "R" for Relative Files or a "U" for User Files.

## OPEN 15,8,15, "M-W"i CHR$ ( 106) CHR$ (0) CHR$ (1) CHR$ (133) 1 CLOSE15

This short program will stop drive chatter on errored disks. It works for most software.

## ML TRAINING

HAROLD WILLIAMS

One of the features of our quarterly meeting in April will be two mini-sessions for members interested in machine language programing. These two sessions are designed for beginners.

One session will cover the use of the popular public domain machine language monitor Super mon written by Jim Butterfield. During this session all of capabilities Supermon will be demonstrated and explained. Supermon and instructions will be available on disk during these sessions and through the club library.

The second session of interest to beginners to machine language will be a tutorial on the binary and hexadecimal numeration systems. After defining these systems examples of converting from one system to another will be shown and discussed. Also, simple arithmetic problems will be done with these systems. Tutorials for binary and hexadecimal will be available on disk during the session and through the club library.

Knowledge of these two topics is mandatory for those members wishing to attend the Jim Butterfield Machine Language Workshop in May!

## REVIEW-VIP TERM

BY ANN BARTHOLOMEW

VIP Terminal extremely complex is a very complete yet telecommunications program.

Some of its many features include: audible margin, key click, programmable function keys you can "environments", with account number, password, name, % phone number, etc. It also different widths, quarterly chimes. аП alarm. &amp; Compuserve compatible graphics. You can LISE either a joystick move the "hand" ·or the corresponding function keys.

Although there are files on the master diel which are identical to the manual you could do worse than to take an evening &amp; sit down % read through the manual. as the manual refers to several applications covering use of HESModem II · Compuserve with VIF Terminal, its VT-52 emulation mode, 3 ASCII listings while the program files do not..

VIF Terminal has so many features I thought there wasn't anything it couldn't do. But. that was before found its major flaw. a tiny capture buffer of only ?K. This is due to the fact that when Softlaw wrote the program they designed it with an option of 7 screen s12es. While they could have kept the screens onthe master disk next to the program files, they chose instead to store all ? screens in memory. Besides the 40 column medium characters width default screen. YOU can also choose from the following:

1. 40 colums wide characters
2. 40 columns narrow characters
3. 54 columns narrow characters
4. 80 columns medium characters
5. 20 columns narrow characters
- E. 106 columns narrow characters

You may never need any of other sizes, but they're stored the in memory just in case.

Despite this major flawa VIP Terminal has other nice features. such it entry phone book, where you can move the hand to the number you want · push the fire button. 8 VIP Terminal will dial the number for YOU. It also has autc-answer, for those modems equipped with the feature. can receive programe · files from another user. It also has an editor you can use to edit files as they come in,. or those you want sent later.

Those members who are students at. NTSU &amp; are taking COBOL can use word processor convert their programs into files &amp; use VIF Terminal to send the program to the mainframe on VIP Terminal as it has prompted upload feature. But then · 550 does Vidtex &amp; it has a larger buffer.

With all things VIF Terminal do, it's a pity that the capture buffer is so small. If the buffer were larger it would have competion from several public domain telecommunications programs such as First Term. which has autodialy autoanswer. programable function keys, word wrap, is much easier to understand how to use, has the capability to convert files from program IMG., and best of all, a 42k capture buffer.

It you like programs with lots of bells &amp; whistles, then you'd like VIF Terminal. As for me, I'll stick with First Term.

## MORE ADVENTURES OF BIG MAC THE MAD MAINTENANCE MAN BY MASTERTRONIC
