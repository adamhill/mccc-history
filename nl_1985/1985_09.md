IBM YS. CEM A HANDE-ON COMPARISON

I have had the opportunity for the past couple days to work closely and at great length with an IBM PC using the "Multi-Mate" Word IBM (itsy-bitsy-machine), we all know, is that other computer manufacturer, and Multi-Mate is one of the best word processors made for it. This is the first time that I: have had extended hands-on time with an IBM in order that I could do a real comparison between it and my trusty Commodore 64.

On my C64, I use the "Omniwriter" word processor by HES. The two prograns are very similar in how they work and so probably make a good pair to compare. I won't pretend to be unbiased, but I will try to make this as fair as possible.

First, the similarities. Both use a visible format line which can be modified at any time. Both allow side to side scrolling for page widths wider than the screen allows thus allowing you to format text on the screen the same as it will appear in print. Both have the same standard word processing features: Move, copy, insert, delete, word wrap, etc.. but once you get past the superficial similarities, the differences are quite dramatic.

## THE CONTROLS

Commands to Omniwriter are done in two ways. Formatting commands require

BILL RAECKE

that you press the CTRL key and then &amp; letter to indicate which function you want performed. The letter C stands for centering, " stands for underlining, I stands foI indent, etc. Editing commands require that you press the Commodore Logo key and then a letter. C stands for copy, M stands for move, S stands for save, etc. The point is, all the letters make sense in relation to what you are trying to do. You almost don't need to look at the instructions. MultiMate, on the other hand, uses a series of function keys to accomplish the same thing. To copy text you use F8, to move it's F7. Some commands require a combination of keys such as a CTRL + F8 or an ALT + F5. / This 1s all very arbitrary and requires memorization of the commands and/or the use of a cheat sheet.

Multi-Mate does make up for this shortcoming however. They have a help feature built into the program. At any time you can hit the Shift- F1 combination and get a help menu. selecting one of several general topics from this menu, you will be taken to another menu where individual commands are listed. Then by hitting the proper combination of keys, detailed instructions on the use of the function are returned. When finished, you simply return to the text by pressing the ESC key. All in all a nice, though time consuming, feature which probably should have been made part of Onniwriter.

## PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

## DOCUMENT SIZE

Given the limited memory capabilities of out 064, this one comes as a shock. Although a document on the IBM can be disk size, only one page can be resident in memory at a time - a maximum of about 100 lines. Each time a page is filled, the system automatically saves that page to disk and starts a new one. This is a nuisance because it forces you to repaginate the document after inserting or deleting text from a completed page. Using Omniwriter, I don't normally determine page breaks until I am finished editing.

## DISK ACCESS

This is where the IBM is really superior. The program loads in almost no time at all, and all that saving and loading of page after page of text is handled very quickly. The normal time to switch between pages of a document is about 4 or 5 seconds.

## PRINTING

The IBM offers a nice print feature. Document printing is handled from the disk rather than from memory as is the case with the C64. What this means in real terms is that on the IBM you can be printing one document while you are editing another. This might not be practical given the slow disk speed of the commodore, but it sure is nice not to · have · to wait until a document is totally printed.

## SPEED

The IBM is slo000w!! This one too is a surprise and can probably be attributed to poor programming rather than an inherent problem in the computer. But for whatever reason, copying text, moving text, inserting text, deleting text - even simple typing - all of these functions are handled almost instantly on the Commodore with Omniwriter. Not so With IBM. The response is extremely slow and after a while becomes quite annoying.

„* * *4*

## SUMMARY

Each computer/word processor combination has its good and its bad points. If I had to choose between the two based on my experiences so far, I would choose the Commodore - even if price were no object. Am I biased? Maybe. One thing is certain: Commodore owners certainly don't need to feel inferior. The Commodore outperformE the IBM in many ways and is definitely not simply a game machine as IBM and would have us believe. Maybe a blindfold test ala Coke and Pepsi would be in order. And just wait till we have the C128 and the Amiga -- just wait.

## BBS GRAPH CB By Dauid Rye

People are just beginning to discover the unique potential of using the MCCC BBS to create graphic displays to use in letters and on the message base. Here are a few hints to help everyone use Aaron and Craig's excellent program in creating graphic masterpieces.

1. Prepare the graphics off-line, that is, using just your computer and terminal program with out being on the BBS.
2. Load and run MOCC Term 3.0
3. Press F7 to enter Dial/Parameter mode. Press D to go to half-duplex.
4. Open your buffer with the function key, F4, an O (open), and RETURN.
5. Remember that you must tell the BBS as well as your program what MOdE you are in. Enter CTRL O to tell the BBS that you are going to use graphics. If you want to play with the Cursor, first tell the BBS with a CTRL J (non- destructive cursor). Then use shift i- (left arrow) to put YOUR computer in that mode. (Remember, you have to keep the TWO computers in the same mode or you will get confused and not realize what you will be sending.
6. change colors or use reverse characters. You can also go upper-case graphics with a CTRL U (to the BBS) and the normal C= and SHIFT on YOUR keyboard.
7. Caution! When using the nondestructive cursor to hop around the screen, DO NOT use the INST/DEL key if you make a mistake or want to move the cursox to the left. Instead use the left arrow key. Also, remember that messages and graphics have a limit of roughly 49 lines of command whether they are letters or graphic characters. Save your work often as you are creating it. You may find that your final masterpiece is too long and will not accommodate that last little improvement.
8. Then Close the buffer with a F4 and a C for close. Then F4 and an S to save it.
9. Now you are ready to call the BBS and leave your hard work by posting a message or sending it to a friend via EMail. Go back to Dial menu (F7) and change to full duplex. Dial the BBS, and when sending to the BBS (E-mail or message Base) either Transfer from your buffer (F4 and T) or from your disk (F2 and S).

Start by just changing colors in a letter or message and you will soon be drawing portraits!

## BO MILLION DOLLAR LOSS AT COMMODORE

By Michael Cramer

Commodore International Ltd. said that it will report a drop in sales and a loss of almost $80 million for fiscal 4th quarter which ended June 3. This included an inventory write-down of

The company had previously denied that it would take any such write down. The quarterlyloss will wipe out Commodore's nine month profit of slightly over $10 million and reduce it's net worth by almost 25 percent.

Good news for the current quarter which ends Sept. 30 may also be in doubt. The company has just begun to ship the new 128 anaye An gu is got expected late September. Commodore hopes that these two products will revive it's sagging sales which have dropped almost 50% in the last 6 months compared to the same period a year ago.

though the 128 will be sold in mass merchandise stores, many observers do not expect its peak sales to match the 64.

Commodore has promised that the Amiga will be shipped on schedule even though the option to run IBM software is not ready. The Amiga is generally conceeded to be as fine and powerful as anything in its price range but it will probably have a difficult time getting shelf space from independent retailers, some of whom still harbor resentment over the past marketing moves which placed Commodore stores like K-Mart and Target. At latest report less than 300 dealers nationwide had agreed to stock the Amiga.

There is a new service available for home computer users. The service is called PC PURSUIT and it will allow home computer users to pay a flat rate of $25 per month for. un limited evening and weekend telephone use for computer communications. There is a one-time $25 registration fee to obtain the service. It will initially serve 12 major metropolitan areas across the country.

This means that if you are going to communicate with people or computer services in other locations, you can do so without incurring the associated long- distance fees; your $25 per month covers it all.

The service is currently available in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, New York city, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Suburban areas are also accessible. The procedure is that the local registered user calls a local access number for PC PURSUIT, types in his phone number, the city he wishes to call and the number he wishes to reach. The user then hangs up, the PC PURSUIT network makes the call and then calls the user back with the connection in about 20 seconds. The callthe service is available only to authorized users and Will allow logging of all calle In an attempt to reduce computer crime.

The service is available immediately. For more information, or to sign up for the seryice, call GTE Telenet at 800- 3684215 during business hours or call a 24hour electronic bulletin board at 800-8353001.

## On-Line BBS Directory

Telecomputing devoteeg have an unquenchable thirst for bulletin board listings. Common sources for BBS info are the boards themselves; typically, they post short rosters of local systems, and callers leave messages which pronote new boards and describe others. Because touting the competition is usually not a BBS's main purpose in life, the data can be unreliable and scanty at best. However, there is what I call a BBS of BBS's, which specializes in accurate information about other boards around the country. Named the On-Line Computer Telephone Directory BBS Information Exchange (OLCD-BIE), the board is run by system operator (sysop) Jim Cambron, via his company, J.A. Cambron Co., 6810 N. Liberty Street, Kansas City, vi hit company: than Gry. MO 64118. You can call the BBS 24 hours a day at (816) 436-4563; use 7 bit word size, even parity, and full duplex. Both and 1200 baud are supported, and there's a 25 minute time limit. Although this outfit is long distance for most of our readers, a few sessions each year can yield a wealth of verified BBS data to your inventory. Hint: for best value, share the info and phone tariffs with some friends.

understated purpose of OLCTD-BIE is the exchange of news and information on telecommunications for BBS users, sysops and all interested parties. The system is menu driven, but offers an expert mode Essentially, the BBS consists of sections: a data base of U. S. and Canadian bulletin boards, downloadable terminal programs for CP/M and MS- DOS based computers, a two part message base, and a text file exchange which emphasizes articles on telecommunications. Here's what you can expect when you go on-line with this fine board.

When you first log on, you will be greeted with opening messages which include the purpose of the BBS, and reminder on the system index (more on this in a moment). You will then be prompted for your name, city and state. Recognized callers are asked for their passwords and are then routed directly to housekeeping

statements. As a new caller, however, will be asked about your communications needs: screen width, computer type, line feeds, upper/ lower case use, and after carriage return. Enter "no" when prompted for changes to the last three settings and you should have no problems using most terminal programs. Next, you get the chance to set up a case sensitive password of up to eight characters. Housekeeping announcements follow and include the last megsage number posted on your prior call, the current final message number, how many times you've called, time limits, and active message bases.

After these preliminaries, you are shown the system's main menu, a selfexplanatory 13 option affair. Be sure to select B (Bulletins) first, for important system news. If you're having screen display problems, choose C (Configure System for Your Terminal), to adjust the same parameters, such as screen width, that were covered during initial log on.

A unique and extremely helpful menu i tem is I (Index to this System). This feature displays an alphabetized list of subjects and functions of the BBS, along menu/submenu commands to implement them. The index holds 78 items, from "Apple-CP/M MODEM software" to "Xerox 820 MODEM software. " A true key to expert system use, the index 1s a treasure you should capture and save for reference.

To access the heart of the board, its directory of free-acoess verified BBS's, use main menu item D. At first, you are briefed on how to search this data base. Dubbed "hints", the instructions are more than merely helpful; they are actually vital to extracting BBS listings. Here's how it works. In response to a search string prompt, you may enter a subject, bulletin board type, area code, or state; a slate of boards that match your entry will then be displayed. The subject may be any key word, such as "CP/M" Or "C-64". The BBS type string must have a leading space character; for example, enter ABBS" to get Apple type systems. Area code entries must be preceded by an asterisk; for instance, enter "+214" to hunt boards in the 214 area code. For searches by state, you must enter a comma followed by a space before the state's letter postal designation; thus, entering ", TX" uncovers the Texas boards. In case you are wondering, yes, you can evoke a dump of all listings. That avalanche will be

caused by a space followed by return; however, long distance charges for such 111-advised adventures will send you into shock. Heed my friendly warning: don't do it! Furthermore, the sysop limits you to three searches per directory access.

After you enter your search string, the BBS offers a legend of the use codes/abbreviations which appear in the BBS listings. For instance, "*" stands for 24 hour operation, and "g" means sexually oriented material. Be sure to capture these codes. I encountered two undefined codes, "'ew" "evenings and weekends" and "weekends only. " Finally comes the payoff, a display of the boards that match your search string. The information is presented in tabular form and includes phone number, use codes, location, and a short system description.

The BBS 1s supported by voluntary user registration, main menu R. In exchange for 520, Mr. Cambron will recognize your name, computer and password for one year, speeding up your log on. The fees go to defray the $140 a month, according to. 6 11 Cambron, it takes to manage the board and verify BBS entries. However, the sysop will give you a free 18 month registration if you upload a CP/M or MS-DOS communications program which honors XMODEM, or If you upload a BBS listing (exclusive of the Kansas City area which includes phone, location and operating parameters. File transfers are by XMODEM protocol or simple ASCII buffer capture.

I conducted geveral searches of the data base, with interesting results. The key word "Commodore" evoked 6 boards, all of which had "Commodore" in their descriptions: 2 in Washington, 1 in Missouri, 1 in Ohio, 1 in British Columbia, and 1 in Hawaii. My hunt for "C64" did a bit better; 11 boards showed up, only one of which was a repeat from the "Commodore" scan. My state searches were far more successful, yielding 12 Maryland, 2 DC and 79 Texas entries. However, the Maryland group held two outliers, one in Oregon and another in Florida. Unless you are looking for something very unique, I suggest you conduct your searches by state.

Other features you might want explore include a two part message base (BBS info and general topics), an XMODEM section, and text file download exchange. All in all, I found OLCD-BIE to

7

be an excellent "bulletin board's BBS"; comprehensive, and easy to use, it's well worth a call.

## BOARD MEETING Barbara Cramer

Congratulations, Tony Velez, who was appointed Head Librarian in addition to his duties as HEB Chapter Librarian. Tony has been helping the newsletter by providarticles on those disks which needed special explanation. Tony has volunteered for one of the toughest MOCC jobs available and we applaud him for his willingness to tackle the position.

Another volunteer, Laura Clements, will be assisting the officers in learning, using and transferring names from the current membership list data base to Practifile. It was felt that an improved program was needed for handling · membership information to improve service in the areas of the newsletter, BBS and chapter printouts.

David Rye reported that adaptations to the BBS terminal program are nearly complete to accommodate the use of the HesModem II, Mighty Mo and other brands which currently do not work with the oxiginal program. Improvements to the terminal program are also being discussed. If you have a suggestion and would like to help, please contact David for information.

A detailed set of documentation was presented to each chapter for further explanation of the MCCC BBS terminal program that we are now using. Each chapter will be distributing these instructions to BBS members who are interested.

Before the meeting adjorned, plans made to sponsor a booth at the Computer and Camera Show being held Aug. 10 and 11 at the Will Rogers Center in Ft.

## FONTMASTER

By Bob Dodson

Reprinted from the Data Line, Salem Oregon

FONTMASTER is really three programs processor providing nunerous font outputs in one. The primary program is word to your printer. The second program. FONTS+, allows you to dump disk catalogs, program listings or sequential files to your printer with any of the fonts you wish. The third program, FONTEDITOR, allows you to create and modify your own fonts.

## This font, for example, Is Manhattan.

Other fonts such as Baltrous, Script, Puded, Hairpin and others are available at the press of a key. Sixteen fonts are provided with the package and you can design your own. (The newsletter titles in this issue use NI. Bold, a font created by Barbara Cramer.) Three of the fonts are definately of limited use - Mirror, Upsidedown and Special. The Mirror and Upsidedown fonts are just that and are more of a curiosity than anything else. The Special font consists of Greek, scientific symbols and Commodore graphic characters.

Let's look at the word processor. This is a full featured "window" oriented program that has the full compliment of text-editing commands. The program has all the usual word processos "stuff" like tabs, line centering, search and replace, word wrap on/off, block moves, under lining, justification and much more. In fact, this program would be good just as a word processor (without the various fonts). Commands for printer manipulation, like inverse, elite, pica, compressed, sub/superscript and characters per inch are included and made simple. The majority of the commands are executed with two-key strokes, i.e. hold down Commodore key and press 3 to call font three. The processor puts out program files, like Speedscript, and has no provision for accepting sequential files. I have only tho gripes about the word processor. I wish it would accept true ASCII seg. files and I wish the pro-

![Image](1985_09_artifacts/image_000009_9b5375d400a763ab78f72fe880519dafd2c6285a40d3f26700264be7045c17cf.png)

gram had a "preview" feature to give onscreen representation of what the output Will look like. These aside, the program is quite powerful and useful.

Ed. Note: FONTMASTER now comes with an additional program which converts files from other processors to the FONTMASTER format. While this may require some extra and somewhat awkward editing, it is still preferable to retyping.

The FONTS+ program allows you to modify existing fonts or to create your own. A 9 × 16 grid is displayed and using the cursor keys, you can set or erase points much like a sprite editor. The ASCII number of the character is displayed as well as a "normal" sized representation of the letter. You can call in any of the fonts and work with them or start with a blank slate.

The documentation is quite comprehensive and lucid, complete with an index and reference sheet. Consifering what this program can do, it's well worth the $33.95 price. Who knows, this could stir you into writing all those letters you keep putting off!

Ed. Note: One nice thing about getting newsletters from all over the US that if you get busy enough someone will come along and do your work for you! Many of you have already noticed the differences in the newsletter since we have been using FONTMASTER and several people have mentioned the advantages of using it for typing in foreign languages.

To the best of my knowledge, Xetec does not have a local distributor in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. Make sure that your printer will work with the program before ordering either by mail or phone. If you give them your credit card number, they will have · the package on the UPS truck that same day.

## COUNTDOHN TO SHUTDOHN ACTIVISION SOFTHARE

One of the best offerings this year, and Activision's best game since GHOSTBUSTERS, is COUNTDOWN TO SHUTDOWN.

Before you figure out the object of the game, you will be treated to some of the best graphics ever geen on the commodore. Couple this with great sound and excellent game play and you have some 11F38 good entertainment. The complexity of this game is hard to put into words. Let me explain by giving you an idea of the numbers involved. The androids which you control will need to explore over 2, 000 rooms, yes 2,000, and cover 8 individual maze- like leyels. Each of the eight android types possesses varying skill levels for eight attributes, scientific, technical, medical, combat, intelligence, power, strength and mobility. The success of your mission, in large degree, depends on your ability to assign the right android to the right task.

A malfunction at the world's largest power plant threatens to throw millions of people into darkness. It's up to the player and his Android Crisis Team (ACT) to find the central power source in this huge facility and fix it. There are several catches, one of which is the plant's automated defense system designed to stop all intruders -- at any cost!

COUNTDOWN TO SHUTDOWN is one of genre of games that requires intelligence as well as strategy and arcade skill. We recommend it highly.

## NEH OFFICERS BY BILL RAECKE

We have two changes in major club positions this month. Tony Velez has agreed to take on the responsibilities of Head Librarian after the post was vacated by Dan Branam. Our thanks Tony for stepping in and assuring the job when it was needed. Tony has shown himself to be an eager and a capable worker in the past and I'm sure that he'll do a great job for the club.

second major change is that of Laura Clements. Laura has agreed to take on the job of Club Secretary following the resignation of Dana Taylox. Dana simply found himself with too many othex responsibilities and felt that he was spread too thin. I would like to thank Dana for a job well done. And I would also like to thank Laura for stepping in. Laura has done an excellent job working in the HEB Chapter and on the Newsletter and I am sure she will continue with more of the same in her new position.

Four million are forces, which leaves 15 million to do Take from that the 14,800,000 who work government, 200,000 to do the work. There are 188,000 In hospitals, so that leaves 00O 12, to do the work.
