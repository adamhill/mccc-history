## HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Congratulations to all the participants in our contest to discover new ideas for the club logo. We consider you all winners.

The judges included Garry Wordelman. David Glazener: Larry Weist, David Rye and Francine Wharton. They reported having difficult time deciding the winners. After a long deliberation they awarded the following winners.

1st Place - Bruce Nelson 2nd Place - Barbara Cramer

Other entries winning an MCCC cap are Roy Baker and Lenard Lopez. The judges recommend that the club adopt a logo that consists of a combination of the two winners' entries. Bruce and Barbara have already worked on this project and you will notice the results in this issue.

## President's Column

Just a word of introduction for those of vou who don't know me. I bought my C64 in July of 1983. I got it for the kids. I figured I could get some educational software that might help them in school. But then the unexpected happened - I was had a ball with it and they haven't been able to pry me away from it long enough to get any use out of it at

I joined the MCCC in September of It has offered me two things which I need. First, excellent source of public domain software educational for the kids to use when I'm not around). Second, it has provided a place where I can find out new information about my computer that I might not have otherwise known. To me, these two things are what our club is all about.

For the coming year, I would like to see our club do more in the area of education. Every presentation that we sponsor is educational to some degree, but we have had little in the way of formal classes. I would like to see us develop classes in BASIC, COMAL and MACHINE LANGUAGE, and, we could easily repeat the introductory classes recently held in Arlington.

(President's Column Cont'd)

My ideas for the club are based on my own desires and the input which I have received from others. In order for the MCCC to continue to be a sucess, we need to hear the opinions and desires of our members. If there is something you would like us · to sponsor, tell someone. If everyone contributes. our club can continue to grow as it has in the past. And we all benefit from that growth.

BOARD MEETING

The Board of Directors met Dec. 1 at the Hurst Recreation Center with 17 members present.

After discussions about the December Club Meeting and the Logo Contest, the first order of business was taken up concerning the repair the Cramer's disk drive which is used heavily to produce the newsletter. It was unanimously agreed to provide the funds ($85.00 + postage) to send the drive back to Commodore under their repair/replace policy.

Bruce Nelson indicated he would provide a full financial statement in January showing the club's year and financial status.

The Ft. Worth Night group petitioned to become a chapter by presenting list of members who regularly attend their meetings. The petition was approved adoption of \_a name and officers will follow their first meeting.

With winter conas nore time spent indoors and maybe aore time spent on our computers. It is also the season when we turn on house furnaces and the indoor humidities drop to very low values. Combine the low humidities and al1 the synthetic fibers that we have in our rugs and clothing and static electricity baconas a menace to our computers. In the past month, I have over a dozen of the same kind of "chip" lintegrated eircuit) that is the "switch house" of the C-b4. One or less a month is the usual average. In a couple of months another type of chip will be failing in greater nuabers as our humidity drops even lower later in the winter.

## JAM. 85

The Commodore computer espacially vulnerable to static discharges because of both its plastic case ithat does not dissipate the static charge the way a metal case would when we touch it) and because of the exposed contact terminals around the outsida of the 0-64. The joystick porté are extremely bad in this respect since they are close to the power switch and our fingers usually brush the pins when we feel for the power switch to turn the computer on and off. Another contributing factor is that Commodore, in trying to keep the cost of the C-64 down, did not buffer (put protection devices) between delicate chíps and the outsida world. complicates makes situation even worse is the flexibility of the comrodore in that we as users are constantly changing cartridges, joysticks and plugging or unplugging nodams or "dongles" (protection devices that allow certain programs to run). All of the above conbine to increase the exposure of our computers to damage from static electricity. In our dry climate, building a static charge on ourselves of 40,000 or 50,000 volts while walking across a rug would not be unheard of.

Wee... now that we know all this, what can we do about it?

Although it takes some equipmant and discipline, it's not as hopeless it might seem. A solution of a capful of "Downy' to a pint of water sprayed on household rugs every month or so will help. Covering up the ports on the back of the computer with cardboard flaps that have to be raised to insert anything will also help. Covering the joystick ports with at least three layers of plastic electrician's tape will still provide easy access to the ports and offer protection when the joysticks are not plugged in. The bast protection is to attach static grounding strap (Radio Shack P/N 276-23993 $1.99) to yourself before touching the computer, but for most of us that wouldn't be feasible.

The next best method is to make an inexpensive static grounding touchpad. Radio Shack sells a 5"x5" conductive foam rubber mat (P/N 278-2400) for

$.89. You can attach this pad to the grounded center screw of any wall outlet by a wire with an alligator clip on it. For an added personal safaty factor &amp; 100K OHM resistor should be connectad to the outlet screw and then the wire attached to the other and of the resistor. Then clip the alligator Clip to the foam rubber. An alternative to using the resistor is covering the alligator clip with insulation to you can't touch it. You don't want to provide too low a grounding path for

yourself since that can be dangerous. To use the touch pad, leave it sticking out from under the right side of the C-64 underneath the joystick ports &amp; power switch. Discipline yourself and other housshold computer users to touch this pad before touching anything on the side or back of the computer.

The "Downy', the tape and the touchpad should go a long way to give your chips a longer life in your computer.
