BILL RAECKE

The Jim Butterfleld weekend Is over. It was, bu far, the biggest project that the McCC has ever attempted, and now It's time to revlew Just how well It went and to decide if It was worth the effort and expense.

The weekend started with a bang. know something was wrong when 1 arrived Friday evening for the bonquet and found Harold and Judy williams sitting in the Western Hills Inn lobby. Harold kept telling me to sit down. It seems that the room which we ware supposed to occupy was al ready taken by the Mid-Citles Rose Soclety. The kitchen had prepared only one banquet meal and was faced with two groups of people to food. After they revived me, I was led back to a little room resembling a hallway with two doors and was told that this was our

new banquet facility.

To make a long story short, they did monoge to flt fifty people Into the room and they did manage to feed us wall by serving steak ond baked potato Instead of the buffet which they were scheduled to serve. Other thon the fact that no-one could move, we all had a good time.

Thankfully, the rest of the weekend went more smoothly. The workshop sessions by Jim Butterfleld ware excellent. I know l learned a great deal from all of them. And, on Saturday evening we were treated to a very entertaining evening by both Mr. Butterfleld and Pete Baczor, the now Commodore User Group Coordinator. got a first peek at the now C128.

the time this article appears In print, the C128 should be aval lable in limited quantitles in local stores along with the 1571 disk drIve.

las the weekend worth all the trouble ond expense? Only you con answer that for certain. If anyone has any comments I will be glad to listen. In the meantime, I con only go by my oun opinion and the opinions of others who attended.

Yos, It was worth it. BUTTERFIELD SEMINAR/EXPENSE REPORT:

## ON-LINE

COPYRIGHT 1985 BY PAUL MOTISE ROCKVILLE COMMODORE USERS GROUP

Ori-Line Yellow Pages: Imagine a free 24 hour public data base of retailers and wholesalers of products and services from across the United States, an on-line yellow pages, if you will; no sign up, connect or long distance charges, no passwords or user id's. That's the concept behind a service called TelCor America, of the Business Electronic Listing Corporation, Box 40206, Cleveland, Ohio 44140. Their computer can be reached at 800-231-3158 (Ohio residents can call 800223-5541). Use 8 bit word size, no parity, one stop bit, full duplex and either 300 or 1200 baud. Telcor's people can be reached 9AM-5PM EST, Monday thru Friday at 216-327-1623; you'll have to pay for the phone call to humans.

TelCor America has been on-line for about a year, but has begun strong advertising only recently. The service does have limitations. Callers are restricted to six minutes per session, and the system can handle but a few callers at a time. Yes, the line is most always busy; however, a redial-on-busy routine should get you thru in less than ten minutes. Fortunately, the firm plans to install several upgrades which should be in place by the time you read this. The upgrades, according to TelCor's manager, Mr. Duke Gower, include additional lines and master program revisions. Gower told me that the firm intends to keep the access free, but won't likely change the current time constraint.

I tried the service and was pleased, despite a few glitches and limits. Here's what I found and what you should do, at least for now, when you go on-line with TelCor America. Keep in mind that the service is in the midst of making extensive changes. Once you are connected, the system adjusts to your baud rate, and asks if you accept lower case text. You will then be asked to enter your name. If your name isn't found on their user file, you will be prompted for computer/moden type, city and state, and how you learned of TelCor. If your name is found you will be told how many times you have logged on to the service. Lack of user identifica- tion codes is, in my view, a weakness and potential problem. Specifically, the company cannot distinguish people who have the same name; therefore, if your name matches that of an existing user you may be surprised at your first session to be welcomed back for, say, the tenth time! As a further complication, should your namesake log off while in the expert mode, you could be logged on in the same mode and may have some difficulty figuring out how to get to an explanatory main menu.

Unlike some other information services, declaring your computer type apparently has nothing to do with how text will be displayed on your screen. TelCor defaults to 64 column format. This should pose no real hardship, however, because take up 4i bulletins, help menus and firm listings take up 40 columns at most. The company used to have a margin-adjust command, but it didn't work.

After logon, a short main (Marketing) menu is displayed. First time callers should enter "B" (for bulleting) at the first selection prompt. Be sure to capture the bulletins, especially those that introduce and explain the service. Save the main menu, too, so you can switch to the Expert) mode as soon as you can to save precious connect time.

Finding firms in TelCor's data base is. similar to using a phone directory. First, at the selection prompt, enter "F" (for find listings). You'll be asked to enter a key word, called a general category, to select a 1 market. For instance, enter "computer" to find a modem manufacturer; you wouldn't find anything listed under "modem" in the yellow pages and the sane holds true for this data base. Next, you will be prompted for city and state, should you wish to narrow your search geographically; hitting RETURN alone causes a search of all cities and/or states.

At this point Telcor displays the first category corresponding to your key word, and asks if you want firm listings for it; answer "no" and you are asked if you want to search for more categories, whereas a "yes" brings on the next category and prompt, and so on. I find this proceedure to be awkward and time consuming because categories are presented individually, in alphabetical order and you must respond to two prompts between each category shown; also, callers have no

way of knowing ahead of time exactly how nany categories are waiting to be displayed.

When you see a category that matches your needs, enter "y" at the listing prompt. The first listing (firm name, address and phone number) will then be displayed, along with a continuation prompt; a "yes" here unleashes the next listing and prompt, until there are no more matches. Here again, intervening prompts and lack of totals ahead of time can be frustrating.

The data base, though useful, is by no means exhaustive. My hunt for Maryland computer dealers drew a blank. However, a key word "paper" unfurled 35 alphabetized categories, ranging from "Advertising Reps., Newspaper" to "Wastepaper Wholesalers". My search for newspaper publishers in Maryland turned up only two--"Susquehanna" and the "Jewish Times. " A call for "all" such publishers in the

U.S. uncovered 36, including the Los Angeles Times; the full list of firms was presented in no discernible order. Mr. Gower remarked that he was not at liberty to say how many firms are in the data base; hopefully more firms will enroll.

I believe that the concept of a free on-line yellow pages is outstanding. While far from perfect, the pioneering TelCor is a good start and deserves high praise. Progressive companies would do well to look into listing with the service. For telecomputing enthusiasts, Telcor America offers an inexpensive, painless introduction to on-line data bases, and some useful information. Anybody want the number for the L.s. Times?

Log off by entering G (Goodbye) at the selection prompt. TelCor politely disconnects you after six minutes, but will let you run overtime if you are in the midst of a firm listing.

## POLITE DOS

COPYRIGHT 1985 BY BILLIAM CORONEL

Commodore's new B128, their recently announced upgrade to the popular 64 computer, will use a new operating system called Polite Dos which the company promises will redefine the term User Friendly. The system, designed using guidelines of Emily Post's famous book of Etiquette, forces friendly interaction between the user and the computer by demanding that commands include words like PLEASE and THANK YOU.

To get a listing of files, rather than typing the standard:

Although not completed at press time, the following will give a brief idea of Polite Dos's format.

A&gt; DIR

You would type instead: A&gt; DIR PLEASE

Then, after the listing is given, the computer will freeze up and not perform

## LITERACY TEST

another task until you type: A&gt; THANK YOU

In return for YOUR friendliness the computer will be just as polite to you. In Basic programs, for example, error messages will not be nearly as cryptic. Rather than simply:

## SYNTAX ERROR

The computer will instead display: YOU ENTERED SOMETHING WRONG BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT WAS PROBABLY MY FAULT ANYWAY SINCE THE MANUAL DIDN'T COVER THAT TOPIC FULLY ENOUGH. IF YOU FEEL UP TO IT YOU CAN TRY AGAIN NOW OR MAYBE TAKE A BREAK AND GET SOME LUNCH. IN EITHER CASE - HAVE A NICE DAY.

## NEED REPAIRS?

There is a new network of Commodore Service Centers in operation across the country. Your equipment may now be taken to any RCA Authorized Service Center for repairs. At the same time, Commodore has discontinued the repair/replace policy at the main headquarters. The MOCC still recommends that you take your out - of warranty equipment to Sof-Tex for repairs first. (See the ad elsewhere in this paper). The cost is likely to be much lower for club members and the service just as good.

## HATS OFFI

Congratulations and thanks to Bill Raecke, Garry Wordelman, Harold Williams and Betty Clay for organizing the Jim Butterfield seminar. Plans and problems were handled very smoothly due to the careful attention of both MOO and SCOPE officers.

## I REVIEWS REVIEWS

## MCCC NEWS REVIEWS THE LATEST SOFTWARE COURTESY OF BABBAGE'S AND FEDERATED/VIDEOLAND

ALCAZAR

The Forgotten Fortress ACTIVISION SOFTWARE

This may very well be the best graphics/arcade adventure to date! The unique mix of the game is that you can't tell where the game ends and the graphics begin. Although this may sound abstract it is also what makes a good game GREAT!

With each step you take, look, listen, remember. One corner of one corridor of one castle alone may present several doors, an annoying fly, a smudged pawprint, a flickering flame and more. How you react to any one of those may mean the difference between recovering riches or resurrecting a rather vicious inhabitant, and believe me there are plenty of those in ALCAZAR.

The game starts with a map screen in which you venture through the countryside of ancient castles. Each castle has within it's walls fire breathing griffins, saber swinging guards, bottomless shafts and much much more. The game takes you through over twenty castles with hundreds of rooms, during which you will be called upon to decipher not only visual clues but unique audio clues with no visual identifier.

The bottom line in this game is survival, and to do that one will have to look, listen and remember. ALCAZAR by ACTIVISION SOFTWARE is a winner that should keep the whole family entertained for weeks!

## BARBIE

EPYX SOFTWARE

BARBIE of BARBIE &amp; KEN doll fame is now a computer game by EPYX SOFTWARE. To most adults the idea of a computerized Barbie doll sounds absolutely ridiculous. Fr Of some reason G. I. Joe software doesn't sound near ly as Silly as its feminine counterpart. While nothing will take the place of actual role playing games for children, Barbie and G. I.

![Image](1985_06_artifacts/image_000024_96ace65b5563d16a22c69770d8c179ba8316c2a175a891841727a20bc154ff26.png)

Joe both provide an interesting addition and alternative.

Barbie's programmers allow you the opportunity to not only change wardrobe hairstyles and accessories, but the colors and designs of these elements. Other features of the 'game' include actual conversations with Ken and some fair animation of Barbie traveling about town.

I was fortunate to enlist the help of three neighborhood volunteers ranging in age from 5 to 8 years old. All of them had real Barbie dolls at home and enjoyed the idea of playing dolls on the computer. I am pleased to report that they enjoyed the program so much that I was forced to send them home long before they were finished playing. I'm afraid their parents will now have to cope with a Christmas list that includes a Commodore 64, monitor, disk drive and, oh yes, Barbie software.

The program does have major limitation. It seems to me that there are simply not enough choices to keep youngsters interested over a period · of months. Wardrobe, colors and pattern choices become boring once you have tried the possibilities. The dialog and 'action' of the program is also quite repetitous. The program has a serious lack of human intervention. Perhaps Barbie is best left to the 3 dimensional world where children's imagination can lead to more creative play.

## SPEEDSCRIPT 3.0 By Warren Kossmann

Reprinted from the Catalina Commodore Computer Club, Tucson, Arizona

Those of you who have been using the original version of Speedscript, which appeared in the January 1984 issue of Compute's Gazette, will be delighted with SpeedScript 3.0 which can be found in the March 1985 issue of Compute. The improvements which have been made are truly impressive!

Although the original version was

handy for most small word processing applications, it had a number of inherent flaws which made it irritating to use for more serious work. The new version is quite a different story. As a result of the changes and enhancements which have been made, the program can easily handle any word processing professional applications!

Those who are familiar with the original version of the program have a distinct advantage since many of the original commands have been preserved in the updated version. The cursor controls work the same way they did before as do many of the other control key combinations. Some of the additions include an search and replace feature which allows the user to either replace selectively or automatically; a function which automatically inserts : 255 spaces with one key combination; a function which removes all unwanted spaces with one key combination; a SHIFT/RETURN which not only ends the current paragraph, but adds a blank line between paragraphs and indents the cursor five spaces so that you can immediately start typing the next paragraph.

Some of the printer format additions include a linked file feature which allows the user to create very long documents such as manuscripts, etc.; a command which allows comments to be embedded within text which will be ignored by the printer; page width command used for centering text; and several very nice page numbering commands which allow the user to select the starting page number or disable printing until a certain page number is reached.

I also like the enhancements to the CTRL P function which now give the user the option of printing to soreen, disks, or printer. the screen option is selected, you can see exactlty where page breaks will occur. The disk option sends the document disk drive in sequential file format. Finally, the print option sends everything to the printer, and unlike the original version, there are no problems with extra linefeeds at the end of each page.

What do I think of Speedscript 3. O? If this were &amp; book, I would say that it should be required reading for everyone! Once the word gets around, the March 1985

issue of Compute is destined to become a collector's item. Thanks to Compute and to

Charles Brannon for a job well done!

## CHIPWITS EPYX SOFTWARE

CHIPWITS, part of EPYX SOFTWARE'S "Learning Fun Series", is a game that teaches young children logical thinking. At the start of the game you are in the workshop, where you program your CHIPWIT for adventures. Your robot will be trained to look for pie or other various objects, including ones as strange as ElectroCrabs. Programming a Chipwit is easy, because the workshop has pictures that represent the actione he can perforn. You can make a Chipwit move, eat a piece of pie or even sing a song!

When your program is ready, send Chipwit any of eight different adventures. If he makes a mistake simply return to the workshop and change his programming. The more he learns the more your children will learn. The multiple displays make this programs concepts easy to understand. Although this game would be somewhat difficult for a preschooler it still is a must for children. Young teenagers would enjoy it also!

## BO COLUMN COLOR TV

If you are thinking of buying an adapter or a program for your 64 that will give you 80 columns, a COLOR monitor orTV Will almost definitely not give you an acceptable picture. A single phasphor screen (green, amber, white) monitor will be needed. -Tom D'Angelo

## ASTERISKS

Watch out for Asterisks just before the type of file when you list disk directory. It signifies that the file was not closed properly. It also means that you will mess up your disk if you continue to use it without VALIDATING the disk. To VALIDATE type (in direct mode):

OPEN15, 8, 15, "V": CLOSE15

(CAUTION- VALIDATE will eliminate any RANDOM files on a disk. ) -Tom D'Angelo

G. I. JOE EPYX SOFTWARE

G. I. JOE -- they should have called this game something other than that, because it's great! G.I. JOE is a combination of several familiar game types. It has a flight game with jets, a tank game fought on ground, a helicopter sequence and more, including some close up combat scenes with one of twelve enemies that you select.

The game starts by checking the computerized World Hot Spot Map, which looks like it was taken right out of WARGAMES (the movie). The map is checked to locate the areas of COBRA activity. You pick the area that needs your help, and select the G. I. JOE who's best suited for the mission. Your choices range from RECONDO to TORPEDO to SNOW JOB and each one has his own area of expertise. The heat-loving jungle trooper RECONDO is best suited for battling DESTRO in the Amazon, but WILD BILL with his Assault Copter, Dragonfly, is your best bet if your headed for bush country. In all there are sixteen G. I. JOES to choose from, including the popular DUKE and STALKER. No matter who you choose survival is tough and the objective the same-to find, capture and destroy COBRA headquarters.

Overall G.I. JOE is an excellent game with many variables which make it an ongoing challenge.
