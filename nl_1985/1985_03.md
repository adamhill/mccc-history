## PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

BILL RAECKE

By this time most of you know that the MCCO is cooperating with SCOPE to bring Jim "Mr. Commodore" Butterfield to the area for a weekend. This will be a unique opportunity for all of us to learn a little from the master. I would like to use a little space here to bring everyone up to date on the latest plans for the visit.

The date has now been set for the weekend of May 11-12. Saturday morning and afternoon will be devoted to one or two workshops in Basic or some other topic of interest to beginning and intermediate computer users. The exact format for Saturday is still being negotiated with Jim and will be influenced by your response to the questionnaire enclosed elsewhere in this newsletter. Sunday morning and afternoon will be devoted to a workshop in machine language. In addition to the workshops, there will be a talk on Saturday night which will be largely entertainment in nature.

There will be fees charged for events in order to offset the costs to the clubs. The machine language workshop will cost $15 for the entire day. The Saturday sessions will cost $10 for morning or afternoon, or $15 for both. The charge for the Saturday night session will be a token $1.

The major problem is going to be the limited number of seats available. The Saturday night session will be open to all, but because the workshops will be hands-on, we will only be able to accommodate 50 in each session. Tickets will be made available in late March or early April and will be on a first-come

## LOVE AT FIRST BYTE

BY LARRY GROEBE

Last issue I dashed off what was admittedly, a love letter to Commodore.

And they have "em.

Allright. Valentine's Day was LAST month. And although you can love someone, you can simultaneously dislike certain of their features and/or pick arguments with them. As much as I love CBM, I am not blind to their faults.

You can start with the original keyboard ОП the very first PET. Goodness, how Commodore thought that anyone past the age of 6 could type on it is beyond mR. It's a miniature matrix of tiny calculator keys that only LOOKS like a typwriter keyboard. Once you try hunting and pecking on it. you'11 know what I mean.

Or how about the 1541 disk drive? Priced well, to be sure: but there are cassette recorders for other computers on the market that can transfer data faster than this diskette. Or even the Datasette when you use TurboSave.

or worst of all, the Plus/4 and 16 computers. The ló is a machine without any audience, and the Plus/4 is just plain cheap. with "enhancments" awkward and limited that it would be better to buy a C64 instead.

These mistakes are all in the past and cannot be corrected. But how do the newly announced computers, the 128 and the LCD, stack up? Do the new machines bode well for Commodora's future?

The 128 first: Two thirds of it, I like. First, it is completely compatible with the 64, which achieves a couple of things. A lot of 64 owners will find the new machine most appealing. And new-computer owners won'tsuffer from the problem that strikes many new machines - that being no software for the first year.

Then there's the 128 mode which offers a lot of enhancements, most noteably, improved BASIC, faster disk access, and twice the screen resolution (which means...80 columns!)

On the other hand, there's that 3rd mode...CP/M 3t. CP/M??? When was the last time you saw a CP/M 3t program at your local Videoland? or even Computerland? Oh well, two out of three modes isn't bad, I guess.

But combine an 80-column mactine with GOOD software, the ability to take it anywhere and use it within 2 seconds of turning it on, AND the ability to plug it into the Commodore disk drive and enchange files, and we have a machine that I could find a dozen real uses for without any trouble.

The other new CBM computer is the LCD. (Now who wants to pronounce CBMLCD?) If this machine turns out to be ANY good it could turn out to be VERY good, indeed. We'll know only when see how the permanently built-in integrated software works. If it works as well as that in the Radio Shack Model 100, we have a winner. If the functionality is on the order of the Plus/4, well...

I urge you to take a close look at the LCD.

Of course if it doesn't thrill you, well, there's always the Amiga computer to be unveiled this summer...

## REVIEW-MUMMY'S TOMB

CYMBAL SOFTWARE

In keeping with our tradition of trying to review a little bit of everything, including what's hot &amp; what's not, I recently spotted this program on the shelf in VIDEOLAND. Most people have not heard of this new game by Cymbal Software. The game is by no means a well known "SMASH HIT" but in many respects could become one. appreciate when a software company bothers to put pictures of actual screens on the outside of the box. Tha pictures at least make some representation of what one can expect to find after they purchase the software.

MUMMY'S TOMB is an arcade mazo game that claims to be "INFINITELY VARIABLE" which is a nice change from other games of this type which soon become very repetitious at least on the lower levels. Tha games object is to gather treasures while avoiding the snakes, bats, spiders and mummies that chase you throughout the mazes. On each level the pursuers move more quickly than before making your challenge progressively more difficult. On the higher levels where the MUMMIES chase you they are equipped with fireballs. Your environment on each lavel consists of a series of nine rooms arranged in a three by three square. Each room consists of a maze with a treasure chamber in the center. There are two entrances to each treasur· chamber signified by white keyholes at either end. Each room also contains a colorad key and a white sword. The treasure chamber can only be opened by the key that corresponds to the color of that maze. The keys are in a different place each time the game is played so it is not possible to develop patterns. Once you have the key for the keyholes will flash indicating it is safe to enter the treasura chamber. Inside each treasure chamber is a unique treasure. There are nine different treasures, each with different quality. There are tresure chests, gold crowns, diamonds, orange lanterns and even blue cowboy boots.

These treasures allow you to move faster during parts of the game or to teleport to a different room at the press of a key. There is a status board at the bottom of the screen that allows you to keep this all straight.

This game is a real challenge and has anough variables to keep even the best game players on their toes. Priced under $20.00, it is one of the best games of it's type.

COLOF: POKES: Its easy to determine the right color poke for the 8 colors shown on the front of your numeric keys. Just subtract 1 from the number on too of the key. FOR EXAMPLE:

POKE53280, 3 gives a CYAN border.

POKE53281,2 gives a RED

background.

POKE646,7

gives yellow

## TERRY CREASY'S ROOM

COMAL .2.0 3 MONTHS AFTER THE CARTRIDGE ARRIVED!

LiSt) and they will be changed to upper case. Any words that reserved, arriable names, print su such as lower first'(array()) CLOSED. You can switch to old way, same case, if you like with:

USE SYSTEM

The cartridge provides version (a an 2.00 64K COMAL EPROM) exceptional operating system and programming language for the Commodore 64. The many changes made to the system really give you the impression that you are working with a larger machine. Once again, will discuss some of the advantages (and problems) of programming in COMAL 2.00.

## THE EDITOR

The C64 KERNAL EDITOR, let's call him ED, is a utility program everyone uses; when you turn on the machine ED immediately tells you the system is READY and then waits for you to type something at the flashing cursor. Standard ED built into the 64 is one of the most capable in any now, witn full-screen editing and the behind quote cursor-down key typed after character instead of the cursor down you wanted.). The writers additions to good programming hassles.

processor. CHANGE help you by making it very easy to find or modify any text in the program. The syntax of these commands is:

FIND text

CHANGE old text, new text

There are other uses FIND command; if remember the you exact name procedure, you can FIND and the first line for the can't of PROC each of procedure will be listed.

The upperand lower-case rules have been changed as well. You can type in COMAL keywords as any combination of characters (List, LIST, or

KEYWORDS ' IN' UPPER ' CASE (FALSE) - (all words or NAMES ' IN' UPPER' CASE (TRUE) - (ALL WORDS UPPER CASE)

can save on keystrokes when you eight function two sets of definitions, one in immediate (programming) and the other when a program is the instruction DEFKEY, Any string you can print on the keys: DEFKEY (1, WASTED FUNCTION KEY, SORRY!"'"13'"). The strange looking 13 is for a carrage return is written in the 2.00 way of writing discussed below).

For text editing there are keys for advancing or retreating one word at a time, CRTL F and CTRL B respectively; jumping to the of erasing from the cursor to the end of the line, CTRL к. Screen dumps are easily accomplished; CTRL D and CTRL P will dump the graphics and text screens to Commodore or compatible printers.

## PRINT "Hello CLR "

When 2.00 is started, quote mode is not in effect. So if you try to enter:

The clear screen command will immediately execute! No control characters are printed inside of quotes. As shown in the DEFKEY example above, ASCI I codes must be used for the control characters. The code is entered between double quotes. For example:

PRINT CHR$ (13) and PRINT ''''13""

are equivalent operations. So, how can you program without screen code? Well, commands have been added to make screen operations more understandable and easier. CURSOR the cursor at at desired spot on the screen: CURSOR (10,10) . This is both easier than going into Quote Mode and counting out 10 down and 10 right cursor characters, and easier to read when listed.

PAGE will clear the screen, or, if sent to the printer, feed a page of paper. Should Commodore 64 COMAL listing fall into the hands of an Apple II (or IBM PC, PDP-11, etc.) programmer using COMAL, the PETSCII for clearing the screen, 147, would probably be just meaningless and confusing as the reversed heart character; PAGE makes the meaning of the operation clear. However, quote mode fanatics can call it back with:

USE SYSTEM

QUOTE MODE (TRUE)

This programming environment has really improved what has always been a great piece of hardware. The COMAL 64 is the most enjoyable less than computer (for the price of car) I've encountered yet!

## Other Subjects:

Just as promised, my copy the second handbook arrived soon after the cartridge. Last time, use other drive devices apparent now! Device corresponds to Now, device 9 houses drives and 3:, definitely a new way to addressing. you want to save file other device you must indicate this IN THE FILE NAME.

SAVE "2: SEQFILER. COM" - save on device #9

Actually, file names have a lot of power in this version. Device numbers, true line feeds, and ascii, other options can be selected in the file name.

While writing a program in 2.00, I noticed both that the help screens were really flying onto the monitor and that the response of the system to keyboard input was immediate. What really showed the speed increase was a COMAL 0.14 graphics demo run with i the cartridge. WOW! This is really fast! 2.00 is really noticeably faster.

The second edition of are different from BASIC; this confusion when you are used to COMAL.

So I used changes without a problem. transfer took over two hours to the MCCC club library, 1ook its directory elsewhere in this types available in COMAL 2.00. In addition to strings, integers, and floating-point numbers, hexadecimal and binary numbers can be used. Now SYS $COOO, or mask:= %01101101 statements can be easily implemented. These can make special operations, e.g. sprite definitions, easier to perform.

## COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT:

The system really does lock up a lot, especially when using the disk and printer (Usually during together. an attempt at saving the latest version of the program you're writing).

The disk drive the operation of COMAL cartridge is tiresome. The 1541 drive is an independent, drive. This intelligent disk saves the user some time when housekeeping performing file (copying, renaming, or validating). However, COMAL 2.00 waits for the disk to complete every assembled, then linked: but it sure be nice to just type LINK name, with the files I have.

(2) The files must be written using the COMAL standard symbol capability language and call your routines with new keywords, direct from the program, no SYS be called package; to package a packagename be required in the program. The drawback to this becomes apparent when one instructions linking. "Make sure you have a the file COMSYMB on assembler disk" don't! have this file? Until the file appears, COMAL machine language (READ byte, location, byte) will have to be used. (Or sprite definitons, which can be well). Until next time...

## REVIEW-GHOST CHASER

ADVANTAGE/ARTWORX

In GHOST CHASER you will meet Harry the Ghost Chaser and a host of strange adversaries as you explore the 16 different rooms of mysterious Fairport Manor. Points are scored each time you blast the various Phantom Ghosts which materalize at random. and believe me there are plenty. The only way to cap to capture these spooky spirits is to find your way into the treasure room. Scattered throughout the manor are eight keys. As you find and collect these keys. additional doors open allowing you to go deeper and deeper into the manor. You must watch out though for Contre ad many tricky obstacles and above all, avoid contact with anything that moves!

The game is joystick controlled which allows Harry to jump, pick up things, drop things, duck and even jump and hang. The the graphics are designed to look 3-D, so at times I found Harry the Ghost Chaser a little bit hard to control but it added a little more challenge to the game. Overall the game quality was good to excellent with excellent graphics and screens (with the exception of a few boards with strange color combinations). The game is a real bargain in the under $20.00 range and should prove to be a big seller. Again GHOST CHASERS gets my vote for a good quality game and a real fun one that should keep the family in good 'spirits'!!

## KILL CALL WAITING!

BY LAURA CLEMENTS

For those Commodore 64 owners trying to use a modem · telephone line with call waiting, there aren't many solutions to the problems caused by incoming calls.

Page 68 of the Talelearning Modem User's Manual seems to hava the answer. After loading the terminal program of your choice, pick up your phone and dial 9. Click the switchhook to receive the dial tone of your second line.

At this point, you can switch your moden's dial/talk switch to 'dial', hang up the receiver, and use the program's autodial feature. If your modem isn't capable of autodial, instead of hanging up the phone, dial the BBS number you wish to call. When the second dial tone is received, follow the, normal proceedure for your modem call.

In either case, anyone now calling · will get a busy signal, and your connection cannot be interrupted by an incoming call.

## REVIEW-THE PRINT SHOP

BRODERBUND SOFTWARE

By George Pope:

Reprinted courtesy Commodore Computer Club of the Catalina

Addicting! This program will make your 1525, and 801 stand up and be noticed. Also good for the Gemini (see caution) and Okidata. If you don't have one of these printers, do not buy without chacking if it is good for your specific printer and interface as shown on the carton when you buy.

Other cautions. Does not work with the 1526. Will not work with Epyx's "Fast Load". Obviously it will not work with a "Daisy wheel" printer.

Weak points. It is slow. That could be considered a "4" since when printing bit-mapped graphics it tends to overheat printheads. The slower speeds probably produce less wear and tear on the print head.

Strong points. And are they strong! Many of the graphics in this newsletter were prepared using "Print Shop". It will make your greeting cards, posters, signs, banners. You can create your own bit-mapped graphics. Print designs, over print, cut and paste print (That's what we did with the newsletter). Not only that its friendly leasy to use and learn to use) and FUN.

## SPEEDSCRIPT MODIFICATION

BY DAVID RYE

Do you get tired of ALWAYS telling Speedscript that you have a disk (tape.)? There is a modification to have the program default to the disk automatically.

First, load speedscript but DO NOT run it. Then enter the following poke commands from the keyboard.

POKE4483,169

POKE4485,76

POKE4484, 68

POKE4486, 143

P0KE4487,17

POKE4489,234

POKE4488, 234

POKE4490, 234

POKE4492, 234

POKE4491,234

POKE4493, 234

Now save it as D/SPEEDSCRIPT or whatever you like. It you want to always use TAPE use a POKE 4484,84.
