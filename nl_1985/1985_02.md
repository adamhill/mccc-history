## MY FIRST TRUE LOVE

BY LARRY GROEBE

A few months ago Barbara Cramer spoke to me. asking if I would let her print an existing article of mine in the MCCC NEWS.

![Image](1985_02_artifacts/image_000003_b625689f5dcb5e91e27ff9effcf33e73fce219ff52c43b09961002e137dcb6dc.png)

(4K RAM - $795 for 8K) So I had to be content to admire her from afar.

The next month, she asked me for another piece. Again. I said it was fine.

This month, she skipped the formalities and simply suggested I go ahead and write an original column for the newsletter every month. She tempted me with memberships and visions off all the free public domain software I could chew. By now was in too deep to climb out, so here I am.

My Love Affair with Commodore

I saw my first true love 7 years ago in a photograph. Pure and white, with classic looks. possesed of an allure that no other could match.

Yes, she Was gorgeous. that Commodore PET. Back in 1978 when I first laid eyes ОП her. she was unique in this world. A typical microcomouter in those days was an ugly collection of boxes strung together with spaghetti-strands of cabling. The PET-2001 was different an all-in-one computing machine in a single, futuristic white cabinet. This was the kind of personal computer James Kirk would certainly have aboard the Enterprise: modern and self contained, right down to the built-in cassette recorder.

The only problem with my PET was that she exacted a dear price, $595.

The years passed. I grew to know some flashier ladies, in particular a sexy little Atari 400 with color graphics. I almost had a fling with VIC: (whose keyboard was a temptation to me, suffering as I was with a "membrane" keyboard) but vIC had limited graphics and little memory, and so I forgot her.

Then, fate stepped in. Almost against my will, a Commodore 64 came someone with great potential. She was inexpensive, but not cheap, She could be serious, but pretentious. games. She was full of sound and color. (A cheap diskdrive helped, too.)

And we lived happily ever after, the C64 and I. We've been through the good times (like the first time we tried Startext) and the bad (most recently when I formatted my original Kwik-Load diskette in 17 seconds). It's not always perfect relationship, but it's lasted.

And a few months back, when I didn't expect it, first-love came life again. I saw again old admired PET and rescued her from imminent death. She's not quite what she used to be - the years haven't been kind to her. But even if her memory doesn't serve her as well as it once did, she still looks as regal as ever. And she has anice home with us for as long as she wants.

It makes for a mice family, the Commodores and me.

## PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

BILL RAECKE

We are at the beginning of a new year, and we now have many new members who just received their Commodore computers as Christmas gifts. The big question for most of them is most likely, "What now?". With that in mind, I thought this might be a good time to review what the MCCC has to offer. First, we have the MCCC News, our club newsletter. It contains a great deal of useful information each month and is getting better all the time. Secondly, we offer a library consisting of well over 100 disks containing public-domain software. The programs which are available consist of everything from games and business applications to programming languages. To make access to the library easier, the library contents will soon be available in dist form from the library. Thirdly, each chapter offers a monthly program. These programs may be hardware or software demonstrations or they may be instructional in nature. In either case, they are a source of important information helping all of us to keep abreast of the latest developments.

In addition to all of this. club also offers periodic, formal instruction in the use of your computer. This month, for example, we will be starting a beginners introductory class. Later in the year we will hold classes in Basic, COMAL, and Machine Language.

When all of this is taken into account along with the knowledge which can be gained by just talking to other computer users, membership in the MCCC has to be one of the best $20 investments any Commodore owner will make all year. I am proud to be a part of it,

## "GUMBALL"

A REVIEW BRODERBUND SOFTWARE

GUMBALL??? A steam whistle signals the start of another work day at the Sticky Sole Gumball Factory, Eagerly, you begin.sorting the brightly-colored gumballs as they roll down the candy conveyors. With increasing skill. you direct them into the correct sorting bins below. Hurry! You'd better fill the bins fast and get them over to the shipping department if you are going to make your day's quota. Your Supervisor, Mr. Nitpicker, is not making matters any easier. If a single gumball slips into the wrong bin, he charges out and tips everything over! As if that were not enough, you have just recieved war d that a group of overzealous dental assistants is trying to blow up the factory! it yOu don"t 2 ap their dynamite-laced gumballs before they go off - without losing track of your regular duties -- they'll destroy the factory and all your hopes for the future! Success or the doghouse. It' g all up to you at the Gumball Factory!

Gumball is an Arcade-style game for the whole family. it has very colorful screens. and fascinating animation. Multiple levels of from game play keep you getting tired of this game. I don't know why BRODERBUND has not advertized better on this i game, at under $30.00, it's a real bargain.

## RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA

Arthur C. Clarke, master storyteller and author of such notable works as 2001, A Space Oddesey and the original work this game is based on, Rendezvous With Rama, is given credit for colaborating with the authors of this C64 adventure game. It is clear that his best efforts are with the printed word.

The book is typical Clarke, well written, strong storyline with an emphasis on science that is not only possible but believable. The game however does not reflect the excitment and imagination of the novel.

What Rama lacks in creativity is partially compensated in length 14 disk sides). There are some excellent features of Rama that hope other game authors will note. The typestyle is easy and relaxing to read and there is a nice balance of text and graphics with neither dominating your attention. You may save and restore up to nine games in progress and even format a disk. The game play includes several joystick-maneuvered screens with the option to practice if you wish.

The documentation includes an interesting map of Rama (an extremely large extraterrestrial spaceship) as well as the Commander's Handbook which includes a word list for the parser. The documentation also gives you a set of partial answers to help minimize frustration. The hints are written in a simple code so that you will not accidentally spoil the fun. Also available in the program is a 'NEWDATA keyword that will give you information that was included in the game after the manual was printed.

In two days of concentrated effort, using the hints, of course, I managed to get almost halfway through the 4 sides. My biggest disappointment was in the graphics which lacked imagination. There is a point at which you just don't appreciate seeing апу more doors, hallways: and rooms filled with inanimate objects. The text seemed average with a lot of room descriptions and humorless "information", Perhaps I was expecting too much of an adventure game based on a classic book. To be perfectly honest though, I did not see any result of the author's collaboration. While the concept has great potential, it has resulted in a good, but not great game in this example.

If you have played and finished this or any of the other games in the Trillium series (Farenheit 451, Dragonworld, Amazon, Shadowkeep), I would be interested in your opinions.

Our thanks to Videoland for again supplying the software for this review. Their assistance to our club is greatly appreciated.

## EASY SCRIPT REFERENCE GUIDE

JOE RICKLEFS-BARBARA KEDHANE CATALINA COMMODORE COMPUTER CLUB

One of the amazing things about the Congodore 64 is it's price. No other computer cones even close to matching it's power for so little investaent.

Software from Consodore is also extremely reasonable in price. Where else can you get a full blown word processor that does everything but walk the dog for under $35.08? I'a talking about EASY SCRIPT! It has so many commands and functions that l'e either constantly reaching for the reference sanual, or just using a few segorized consands and not utilizing the real power of this word processor.

Sadly enough, Consodore did not include a quick refernce guide to EASY SCRIPT. So without further ado, here is a quick reference guide Complete with all coemands and page nuaber references that should enable you to tap the unused power of your EASY SCRIPT word processor:

## 1541 FLASH LUKE DODDS

Skvles Electric 1541 FLASH reduires the new owner to install several items of hardware.. These are an extender board with switch and cable connectors attached: a Kernal ROM assembly and socket: and a 1541 Operating ROM assembly.

Inside the Cé4 the Kernal ROM chip must be removed. The Skyles Kernal ROM assembly plugs into the empty socket. la small circuit board) is the Skyles Kernal an empty socket plug in your original Kernal ROM. This is 50rt of a piggy-back arrangement.

The extender board plugs into user's port (left rear) of the C64. A short three wire cable from the meW Kernal ROM assembly plugs into the extender board. Apparently the switch on the extender board determines which Kernal ROM is in use.

If the Kernal ROM is soldered into your particular C54 qualified model. ask technician to perform installation of your Kernal the ROM assembly.

Inside the 1541. the Operating ROM chip is first removed. In its place plug in the "new" ROM assembly and Skyles supplied replacement ROM. Your oriçinal Rom is no longer used. Next remove the Input 6522 chip flocation varies with 1541 model). Fin 19 of the removed chip is gently bent straight outward from the chip body. This ROM is then plugged back into its original socket with pin 19 out sideways in the air so to speak.

Part of the 1541 cable ·assembly consists of several Wire: joined together at a lug and grounded under a screw at one corner of the 1541 printed circuit board. Two wires have microclios attached at the end. One color microclip ia clipped onto pin 19 of the 6522 (bent out straight above). The other color microclip is clipped onto pin 18 of the same chip. The bundle of formed around the rear of main printed wiring board and exita near the fuse holder on the rear panel. A "stick-on" cable clamo 38cur25 the cable. The other end of this cable plugs into the extender board on the C$4.

In summary: A choice of two Kernal ROMs are in place imside the C64: new Operating ROM is installed in 1541 and its inDut 6522 wiring the is modified.

The instruction booklet is clear and includes illustrations to aid installation. Great CarE Must. be exercised. Once installed it is a sturdy arrangement and should give trouble.

Putting the FLASH to work is not difficult. With the switch the extender board in position nearest the computer, the Có4 comes up with the FLASH fully activated. A POKE will return the computer to slow mode the extender board switch will do the same thing. An " OPEN command is required to change the 1541 to the slow mode. Another set of POKE and OFEN commands will return the system to the fast (FLASH) mode.

I had great expectations for rapid loading using the FLASH. I tried several disks with results as shown below:

| Blue Max             |         84 | 40                    |         |

Skyles advertising implies FLASH loads programs "three that times faster-". My data disagrees.

FLASH provides set DOS commands. They must be called up with SYS command. I Was i disappointed since I had looked forward the helpful DOS commands that would not be lost if RESET became necessary. I miss the ! (slash) command in the C64 WEDGE. In its favor the FLASH DOS uses no RAM. The commands include the usual

rapid initialize. et.c.. access new. for directori, validate. scratch.

One valuable command provided (DOS not reguired is shift; run stop) to substitute for the 01 d Load "*". 3,1 CRET: Again I was disappointed. It wolld not 1cad FLIGHT SIMULATOR or NITE MISSION FIN BALL disks. SOLO FLIGHT loaded satisfactorily.

I tried the 10 new editing commands. All functioned properly and appear to be great timesavers. Only time will tell if the "Advanced Programming Commands" are worthwhile.

This product is a definite normal 1541 performance. Continued use will prove interesting. Skyles warrants the product (material and labor) for period of 4 months after date of purchare. Luke Dodds

## DATASOFT'S "CONAN"

A REVIEW

Is "CONAN" just another "Famous Face" trying to ride on its good name? As the heroic, mighty CONAN your goal is to find and destroy the Villainous VOLTA. Your journey takes you deep within an ancient castle inhabited by frightful creatures and filled with deadly traps.

can also climb ladders, and by hurling your power sword, demolish your enemies, If a sword reappears once it has been thrown, you can capture it and add it to your reserve. Some foes will not be destroyed when struck by your sword.

while searching for Volta, you may battle your way through seven levels; each level introduces you to different foes and different dangers. You will encounter fierce dragons, glowing flame monsters, giant floating eyeballs. electric spark creatures, and lethal leapers.

The primary objective in each level is to obtain gems, place them gem holders and find the key to unlock the door to the next level. The exit from each level is indicated by a flashing arrow. You must determine the safest, fastest way to the exit.

You can walk, run, jump. and fall from any height without harm. but must avoid falling into pools of water, lava pits, fire pits, or the spike pit. You

You have one friend, a large bird, who keeps watch over you throughout your quest. He appears in some levels to aid you (touch him and recieve an extra life, and eventually heips you to destroy the evil VOLTA.

The only thing that the game quality lacked was the color and animation. Through most of the game, there were only three colors on the screen at once. This detracted from the look of the game. The game at first is very difficult, and without practice can lead to a player who burns out easily. Reading the instructions first . on this game is a must.

Like "BRUCE LEE". the first entry in the "Famous Faces" series from DATASOFT, CONAN is just an average game, with a famous name!
