'It's funny. Sometimes the most complex programs produce simple results, while simple program can reveal great subtlties and complexities.

I've · seen software comprised of thousands of lines of code that, when run, did very little. On the other hand, I've been playing recently with a program only 17 lines long which has kept me entertained off and on for weeks now.

Technically, the program generates various classes of one dimensional cellular automata. Uh-huh. What it *really* does is let you create life a special electronic life that exists within a computer. You can think of it as being a digital microbe colony, or perhaps as a mathematical algae or plant. You have control over the rules govern life and death, and initial size and shape of the colony. Then, like any good god, you get to set your world in motion and see how life develops.

Some of you may have heard of the computer game of LIFE (no relation to

From the simplest of beginnings, oftimes strange and wonderful patterns develop. Sometimes a colony develops intricate lattice designs which repeat continuously. Sometimes it grows randomly. Sometimes it just dies out. It's usually not possible to predict with certainty what your cells will do once you set them to living. Or what effect the smallest change in your settings will do to the colony.

the board game, and some of you may even have a copy in your collection. The following program is similar in concept, but simultaneously simpler and more complex. Inspiration came from the May issue of Scientific American, which I heartily reccomend that you locate if your find this program as fascinating as I do.

Here's all you reed:

## LARRY GROZBE

A brief explanation is in order at this point. What we are dealing with is (no pun intended) life on the line. Imagine a single row of cells. Here's such a collection, with asterisks representing each individual cell: *** **. Now, whether a particular cell lives or dies is determined by how many neighbors it has within a given distance. Lets say we decide to look at the cells within 2 'blocks' of a given location las we do in the version of the program I just gave you. If there are exactly 4 cells (including the one in our current location) life will go on for another generation at this location. If there are 2 cells, life will also continue. But if there are none, or 3, or any other number of living cells, then any cell at this location will be extinguished.

As you go down the line of cells, checking each location for the proper number of neighbors, you build the next generation of your 'organism.' As each generation 1s built, it is displayed on a new line of the CRT screen. Thus our display becomes a chart of a colony over a period of time, rather like the rings on a tree.

Often though, you may find las I did) that your time-plot looks like algae or seaweed growing downward from the top of the screen.

not. Some patterns flourish briefly, then die out. Often this is due 'overpopulaion. ' to Fortunately, you can change both the initial population and the rules. The pattern and rules I included with the program above is 'guaranteed to live' (sort of like the ads for seamonkeys.) In fact, this particular pattern is fairly interesting. It repeats itself over and over and slowly 'glides' to the right until it hits the edge of the screen where it dies out...eventually.

That is if it grows, which it may

To change the initial colony, replace line 20 with another one. C$ (standing for 'cells') holds the first generation of cells. Any non- space character can represent a cell. You'll find that eve slight changes to your initial pattern make a drastic difference when multiplied over time.

There are two program lines that change the rules. Line 10 sets the distance of a cell's furthest neighbor. Generally, the wider the neighborhood examined, the faster the pattern spreads out. At the same time, these tend to suffer most from massive population wipeouts. The two seem to go hand-inhand - which may be food for thought.

The final area of control you have is over the rules. This is where we total up the neighbors and see how many we have. If you added a rule to the existing ones, like 'RULE(3)=1' (if three cells in the neighborhood, then grow), you'll note the glider pattern goes away, replaced by a dramatic collection of pyramids.

The rules are most flexible. In our current situation there are only two states for any cell - on or off, alive or dead. There's no reason there can't be more states, though. You could have empty space, red cells, white cells, and green cells, for example. To achieve this, simply change the value of a particular rule. A Rule(3)=2, by way of example, means "If the total of the cells in the neighborhood adds up to three, then next time around there's going to be a cell here with a value of 2." The program can handle cells with a value of 1, 2, or 3: each one is given a different color. Here are some lines to insert which produce a multicolored plant- like creature that continues on for quite some time.

10 WI=1

12 RULE(1)=2: RULE(2)=3: RULE(5)=1

13 RU(6)=1: RU(8)=1: RU(9)=3

19 C5="* *** **"

Do the different cell states and colors represent different ages? sexes? species? power? OI something else entirely? That's a question I won't answer. But YOU are free to speculate, and to explore, and to experiment.

Go ahead. Create life! And do pass on what you find.

since wa have arrived at the midpoint of the year, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the officers and all of the others in our club who have worked to make the MCC the success that It 1s. It 15 not alwaus easu and it con sometimes be a thankless job so here 15 my thank you. But while I am on the subject, I would like to take the opportunity to encourage participation from a greater number of our members. There are several areas in which your help 15 needed.

The first of these ls the public domain llbrary. This Is on excellent source of programs that most of us Use from time to time but which most of US take for granted. Some of our members may not realize thatthe majoritu of software was placed into the publie domain bu members of user groups across the country much like our oun. lte currently have a couple of members who are making regular donations to the library, but 1 know that there are many more people out there who are programming and who could be donating their programs. If you fall please contact one the chapter librar lans or any other officer at the next meetIng.

Another area which is in nood of membership assistance is this neusletter. Barbara and Michael Cramar have succeeded In making this publication one of the best of its kind, but finding mater lal to be published is a full time job. with our current membership at approximately 500, It should be no problem to find mater lals from within our club to publish. le need articles. lle nood software reviews. Any plece of computer related Informatlon which 1s now to you will probablu also be now to dozens of other members. Share your Information. Just a paragraph will be appreclated both by the editors and by the membership.

My final point deals what our club quarterly meetings and offer programming offers our membership. We have monthly and classes from time to time. But there is

## BILL RACKE

little feedback to tell us If there are any areas which we are not cover Ing fully. Should our meetings offer more software rovleus? Are there other programming languages left untouched? Should we consider Instruction In software usage? These are question which only our members can answer. Please let us know!

Just remember that any input you make does two things. It makes the job of your officers that much easler and it makes the club much more rewarding for your fellow members.

## EUGENE L. BRONM by Allan Pearson

The members of the MiCE lost a good frland on May 23 When Eugene Lamar Broun died after a severe heart attack. Gene, as we all know him, delved more deeply Into the software Innards of the Commodore 84 than most of us. He had our chased one of the finest librarles of programming software in the club. Ho was always generous in sharing his knowledge with anyone who asked for his help.

Gone was one of those especially talented people who had many interests. He was a musician, had a private pilot's license and enjoyed flying, and also enjoyed comping with his family. He was on electronie uhiz; he was an advanced omatour photographer ond did his oun processing.

Gene entered Rice University when he was 15. When he became old enough, he enlisted in the Novy where he was or Electronic Technician's Mate. After discharge from the Navy he went back school, earning a B5 degree in Engineer ing from the University of Houston. He also attended Northrop Aeronautical Institute.

Gone's career began in 1952 at Bell Hell copter and ended there with his death. His accomplIshments In Aarodynamics and In Preliminary Design were known throughout the Industry. Among these accomplIshments were:

-Six major Engineer ing papers road at NatIonal Conventions and/or published in

Professional Journals.

- -Ploneer ing work on the remarkable Tilt Rotor aircaft.
- -Extensive aerodynamics testing and analysis.

-Numerous advanced-concept proposals.

Gene was active in Troops 21 and 25 of the Boy Scouts of America. He belonged to the Amer i con HelIcopter Soclety and the Assoclation of the US Army. He was a member of the University Christian Church and the Texas Farm Bureou.

Gane was born In Beeville, Texas. He was burled in the Rose HIll. cemetary · In Fort Worth. He Is survived by his wife, llour ine, four children, and a brother, curtis Brown.

AttentIon Music Lovers: Great nows!!! le now have four now music disks aval lable In our growing club library. These now disks were donated to the club by one of our oun members, AARON HIGHTOWER.

The music Is terrific and the menu formats of make them fun and easy to use. The best part of those music disks 15 that they are complete programs In themselves. You just lood the menu first and then choose the song you wont to hear. The program loods ond plays your selection automatically. There Is no need for 545 commands or to manually load each song one by one. You just select, sit back ond enjoy the music. The disks are as fol lous:

## QUARTERLY MEETING By Harold Hilliams

The Quarterly Meeting on July 20 at 1; 30 PM Will feature displays by many of the local businesses. These displays will include new software, new hardware, and special services for owners of Commodore computers. Represented at the meeting will be Babbages, Classroom Micro Systems, Computeristic, Startext, Sof - Tex, and Videoland. This computer show will allow US to see products and services that are available in the area.

A second feature of the meeting will be a display of FontMaster by Barbara Cramer. This new word processor from Xetec has most of the features of a standard word processor but is unique in the way it sends output to the printer. FontMaster uses bit-mapped graphics instead of the normal character. This means that FontMaster produces incredibly high quality print. It has to be seen to be believed. Barbara will have FontMaster running and will answer questions about its use.

As usual we invite club members to bring software and hardware to display for other members. If you have written a program or bought a commercial product that you would like to show, bring it with you! We will also have the club library available for copies.

## ON-LINE

COPYRIGHT 1985 BY PAUL MOTISE ROCKVILLE COMMODORE USERS GROUP

Permission to reprint given by author.

The Most From FIRSTTERM: The Firstterm telecommunications program is, opinion, powerful. sophisticated public domain program of virtually any category for the C- 64, At least three generations of Firstterm making the rounds; FIRSTTERM by Tom Hughes is the "grandfather". Firstterm3, a second offspring by Bill Osipoff, added &amp; 1650 modem autodial routine. The third prodigy known as DIAL4 and FIRSTDIAL4, by Robin Franzel, added the same routines for the 1660 modem, plus a four entry saveable phone directory. All of these authors, in addition to Paul Higginbottom and Steve Punter, from whose programs Firstterm begotten, deserve high praise. It 1s unfortunate that the magazines covering the C-64 fail to mention such noteworthy public domain gems.

There are so many features to this program that many people, even experienced telecomputing enthusiasts, seem to be overwhelmed, and fail to take full advantage of its power; this despite adequate documentation files. To help you get the most from this fine program, let's take a closer look at the more subtle of its offerings. This will be the first (no pun intended) of a two part series.

If you are new to Firstterm, a brief diversion is in order. Load and run your program's boot: FIRSTBOOT for Firstterm, FIRSTDIAL3. BOOT for Firstterm3, or BOOT4 Dial4. Next, print out the documentation file. Do this by hitting 'd' at the main menu; enter 'f' for file; then enter the name of your . doc file and select p for printer. Follow the prompts from there onward. I suggest you read the documentation carefully and try some of the routines off-line, in terminal mode, in half-duplex.

The terminal mode status line provides you with a wealth of information. The timeout flag "*" and the ASCII codes sent/received are subtle yet invaluable. The T appears in reverse video when your host fails to echo what you type. The echo

may normally be suspended when you enter a secret password. However, the reverse may also signal a break in communications; your correspondent is saying "please hold. " This reassuring signal can avert the blood-draining panic that sets in things stop cold. Likewise, the ASCII code display is a comforting utility you can use to troubleshoot problems. As you type a message in full duplex to your host, codes both sent and received should be the when the echo is working properly. Should they differ, you can communications glitches. For example, if you type the letter "A", both codes should read "065" and the "A" should appear your screen. However, line noise should be suspected as the offending culprit if, when you press A, the outgoing code registers 065 but the incoming code registers 066 and a B arrives. This feature also provides a handy, built- in ASCII code table; to "look up" the code "Z" or "CONTROL-B" simply press appropriate key(s) and watch the status line.

Another great feature is the use of dual screens in terminal mode; you see one screen, while a second resides in memory. Try this experiment, again off-line in half-duplex. In terminal mode, type "This is screen A". Now, hold down the Commodore key and hit the "X" key. At first, it looks like the screen has cleared. However, you have actually switched to the screen. Type "Tis is screen B. " Hit Commodore-X again.

Surprise! Your first message appears-you're back to the first screen. Toggle Commodore-X a few times to see how the swap works. The most important thing to remember about switching screens is this: when you jump from a given screen to the main menu (by hitting SHIFT/RUN-STOP) the next re-entry to terminal mode will put you back to the same screen; but that display will clear! Try it, based on what you typed above. If you depart fron screen A, you will return to a blanked screen A. Keep this in mind because there will be times you will want to save &amp; screen-simply switch to the second "disposable" one before you spring to the main menu.

Dual terminal screens are very practical. For example, while on-line, you can use one display as a scratch pad to captu e a menu or listing of downloadable files; switch to the "working" screen when

you send or receive text and refer to the scratch pad when necessary. This time saver can keep YOU from repeatedly prompting your host for help files. You can also use a screen to prepare and transmit short messages.

That brings US to yet another ingenious facet of Firstterm, local edit mode and text line transmission. To enter and exit local edit mode from terminal mode, simply toggle SHIFT/RETURN. When you hit SHIFT/RETURN the first time, your cursor will blink, meaning you have entered local edit mode. What you type in this mode will not be transmitted (confirm this by checking the ASCII outgoing code in the status line). Incoming text, will still be displayed. Therefore, it is prudent to signal your host to stand by if you create local edit mode material while on-line. Without the pause, incoming characters may garble what you prepare. Furthermore, your screen editor is active in local edit mode and, unlike terminal mode, cursor control keys behave normally. Try typing a few lines of text in this mode and then move the cursor to the start of the first line. Watch what happens when you hit SHIFT/RETURN again. The cursor sweeps across the line, drops to the start of the next line, and stops blinking. This means that the line of text was transmitted, along with a carriage return (notice the ASCII outgoing codes again), and you are back in terminal mode. Toggle SHIFT/RETURN two more times, once to enter local edit mode and again to send the next line. You can repeat this process for each consecutive line, or else, while your cursor blinks, move to any part of the screen. A1l characters from the cursor to the end of the screen line will be transmitted when you tap SHIFT/RETURN. Should you change your mind, position the cursor to a blank line before executing SHIFT/RETURN.

Word wrap is one treasure of Firstterm. This feature is turned on and off by toggling Commodore-w in terminal mode. The W in the status line goes reverse video this function is active. Word wrap is helpful when your host transmits data on the assumption that your screen display is 80 or 132 wide, rather than Commodore's 40. Absent word wrap, some words may be split at the right side of the screen, making the text somewhat difficult to read. word wrap prevents this by automatically shifting a would-be split word to the next line. Even if your correspondent is another C- 64 user, word wrap can help decipher messages that your friend types in those continuous streams that result in annoying split words.

We will continue our exploration of Firstterm in part 2 of this series.

## COLOR TEBT

By Ray Sloan

This short program takes a long time to run. It's purpose is to yield color combinations to be rated for future use in home built programs and public domain prograns which may be changed easily.

First build a grid chart on paper 16 cells by 16 cells. Across the top label 'K' with the numbers 0-15. Down the left side label 'J' also with the numbers 0-15. Then label the top 'Color Test I-O'. Second, type in the program and save it as 'COLOR TEST'. Type RUN7000 and press RETURN. Third, after eash screen print, rate the screen say from 0 to 5. Fourth, record your rating in the appropriate cell. A simple return advances to the next screen.

You cannot rate it incorrectly since you are the sole judge. The rating is based on I (border color), J (background colos) and K (script color). The script and background color are the same along the diagonal. Since you cannot read under this condition, these ratings should be "o". Rate each according to legibility and pleasantness to the eye. There are certain script-background color combinations which may also be poor enough to grade with a zero. We suggest you use zero

to mean 'don't ever use this for screen printing' and '5' to mean 'wow, that's nice'.

When you finish this chart you will have rated 256 combinations for one border color. Thus you will have only 15 more Charts to cover the 4096 possible combinations! That's why we don't 'FORNEXT' the I index. Few people would care to do this in one sitting. When you are ready, go into the program (line 7005) and advance I by one and record the I on a new chart. Run it again and write down the combination grades.

It doesn't take as long as you might expect. Anyway, there's no hurry. Later the program user identify and/or remember which part of the program is operating. Other · useful ideas are sure to come to mind.

MCCC NEWS REVIEWS THE LATEST SOFTWARE COURTESY OF BABBAGE'S AND FEDERATED/VIDEOLAND

FLEET BYSTEN E Professional 50ftuare Ine. by Patrick E. McCoy

Fleet System 2 is a word processing program with built-in spell checking by Professional Software Inc. Other popular programs marketed by PSI include WordPro 3+, SpellRight Plus/64 and Trivia Fever. As a minister I use my C-64 almost exclusively for word processing. On occasion this means four and five hours at a time. Like many charter members of MCCC I thought the C-64 was a bargain at $595.00. In those days the only word processor readily available was WordPro 3+. Fortunately this program came from a family of professional word processing programs developed for office use. It even supported a dual drive! The early limitations of WordPro 3+, the lack of color control and a spell Checking program, were resolved.

all this personal background material? Until recently no other processing program has captured attention. Wordpro 3+ handles my needs very well and provides more features than the dedicated newspaper word processor costing thousands of dollars I used in the late 1970s.

Fleet System 2, hereafter abbreviated as FS2, has all the valuable features of WordPro 3+ including full support of the MSD dual drive. It also uses many of the same commands which facilitates switching over to FS2. A utility program called "convert", supplied on the FS2 disk, will permanently convert WP3+ program files into FS2 program files. This was an important feature for me. FS2 also features two text areas, main and extra, which makes customized form letters a snap.

The most significant improvement of FS2 over WP3+ is the built- in spell checking program. With WP3+ spell checking is slow and labor intensive. First, write the document with WP3+. Second, remove the data disk and crash the program

to basic. Third, boot up SpellRight Plus/64 and work a short menu. Fourth, insert the WP3+ data disk and load the document file. Fifth, remove the WP3+ data disk and re-insert the SpellRight Plus/64 program disk. Wait "three weeks" while program checks for matches in dictionary and then edit document. Sixth, renove program disk and insert data disk to save corrected document file. Seventh, crash SpellRight Plus/64 progran to basic and boot up WP3t. Eight, recall document file from data disk and output to printer.

Does that sound like a pain? Yes! With FS2 the process is much simpler. The spell checking dictionary is on the reverse side of the program disk and festures whopping 70,000 words (about double most C-64 dictionaries). While the word {return». The dictionary begins to rall approximately five minutes with a interface. Each suspect word three options: ignore, correct or add to

FS2 works very well with a number of different printers. In the initial set up process an extensive menu of name brand printers are "custom" interfaced with the program. My Prowriter printer, which is included in the menu, now underlines and creates bold face print without accessing the awkward special character codes. The program also supports italics if available.

processing program is active (in memory) you simply put the dictionary side of the program disk into drive one and hit "fl s" for serial flashes in reverse video and the user has dictionary. After all suspect words have been reviewed the document is ready for storage or output to printer.

The program offers 40, 80 and 132 column display. In my opinion 80 and 132 column display are not usable for writing but helpful for visualizing the finished document and for aligning columns. They also chew up a lot of text memory area. However, at any time the program will output to screen the text in actual printer format by hitting f7. By scrolling horizontally the complete text becomes visible. This

feature is available in 40, 80 or 132 column display modes.

Negative comments: The command keys are RUN/STOP and f1. I would prefer CTRL and f7 (f7 and CTRL are WP3+ command keys and I keep getting a video preview by accident). Copy protection includes one of those mysterious holes near the hub of the disk. The dictionary, however, is not copy protected and I made a copy to keep dust particles from being thrown into the drive from running the disk on both · boto sides.

Price: Retail $79.95 which includes program disk and well written manual. Available mail order discount for $50. 00 to $60.00.

Recommendation: Well conceived program and worth the money. May be the best all around professional word processing program for C-64.

## THE COMPLETE COMPUTER FIREHORKE CELEBRATION KIT ACTIVIEI ON

The Complete Computer Fireworks Celebration Kit is a utility for designing your own fireworks displays. The unique plus is that you can create them around themes for every holiday or occasion. From Christmas and Halloween to Birthday or Get Well messages, Fireworks has a seemingly endless choice of arrangements. You can even add your own music, special messages and background scenery. It's a whole new way to send greeting cards to your friends who own Commodore 64s or 128s.

The disk comes with a running demo and nine pre-programmed which show you a few of the possibilities for creating animated cards, party invitations, etc. on disk. And it's fun to use. I would have to compare the quality of this program with that of Broderbund's Printshop. The Complete Fireworks Kit is to the computer what Printshop is to the printer.

The kit includes:

* A program disk with simple, easyto-read menus allowing you to create the most ambitious displays using 25 types of fireworks, 7 special holiday symbols and 20 different songs. You can even use your owncompositions created with the Music Studio, Activision's composer,
- synthesizer and recording program.
* A special blank disk for you to copy your personal greeting.
* A customized disk mailer to let you send your creation safely through the mail.

The Complete Computer Fireworks Celebration Kit is different from any other software product on the shelves. When you consider that the price of a dists is now less than a dollar, Hallmark may soon have some competition. What a unique personalized way to say 'Hello' to your computer friends.

## BKYFOX ELECTRONIC ARTE

SKYFOX is the long awaited flight simulation from ELECTRONICS ARTS SOFTWARE. This famous game familiar to Apple computer users is now available in C64/128 format. The game starts by choosing ranks (skill levels) and scenarios by moving the Joystick in the appropriate direction. The first levels consist of test battles with tanks, planes and some with both. There are also invasions where you must defend your home base and other planes. After you choose a rank and scenario, the base computer appears on the screen. To launch the Skyfox automatically you simply press the fire button. Flying the Skyfox fighter is easily controlled using the joystick. Although the objectives the game are very traditional if not routine, it a very well programmed flight simulation and should prove to be a big seller because or its excellent graphics and realistic control.

## JET COMBAT SIMULATOR EPYX SOFTHARE

EPYX SOFTWARE was bound to come out with one sooner or later, so here it is. JET COMBAT SIMULATOR -- the name says it all, so I'11 be brief. To review and form opinion about this game one must compare it with the other "Flight Simulators" on the market. Let me first say I am just mildly fond of flight simulators, however I do consider myself qualified to judge a good one from a bad one. Jet Combat Simulator is trying to do the impossible in my opinion by mixing a game with an instructural program. I would to recommend passing on this particular program.

## KARATEKA BRODERBUND

Every now and then a really well made game comes along and KARATEKA is a good example. BRODERBUND SOFTWARE has had this game available for the Apple computer for quite a while now and has had good success with it's sale. The game does'nt have any gimicks such as voice simulation or flashy music but it does have smooth scrolling, true-to-life action. starts when your "Karateka" scales a mountain and is ready to battle. detail used to the fighters is excellent and the human-like movement of the players is unsurpassed by anything I have seen. The active detail of the karate kicks and other movements of the players including the shadows projected, is what this a great game. The Karateka encounters several attackers during the game and it is up to you to assure that he remains a survivor. The game has no scores. As in real life, you either die from a fatal kick lending the game) or you continue and fight the final battle! KARATEKA is one of the top Commodore games of 1985.

## BEACH- HEAD ACCESS SOF THARE

BEACH-HEAD II is subtitled "The DICTATOR Strikes Back!". I commend Access Software for continuing their tradition of including several color photos of actual screens, on the outside of the package. First came Beach-Head. Then Raid Over Moscow, and now, Beach-Head II, Is it as as the other two? Yes and the original Beach-Head was first released it was very innovative and had many new techniques not found in other programs. However, today's game programs have become much more advanced. Software buyers expect a lot more for their money. Although software has continued to drop in price, the consumer has become more selective.

BEACH-HEAD II is an excellent game, taking up where the original left off. The overall quality of the game is very good. The things that make this game unique the true head to head two player mode that allows two people to play against each other in a multi-sequence game or a single player to play against the computer. On the surface the game is really 4 games in one with enough level options to keep even the best game players entertained.

## SUMMER GAMES " I EPYX SOFTWARE

When motion pictures are good and have a good take at the box office they make a sequel, and now the same is true for software. SUMMER GAMES II by EPYX SOFTWARE has to live up to a pretty strong reputation of SUMMER GAMES, the orignal, which was released last year before OLYMPIC GAMES. This game has all the ingredients of being another smash hit the improved hires screens enhanced music; this one's a hit!

The game starts with you and up seven other contestants. You choose whether to compete in your favorite individual event or go for it all in the grand competition. The events include Cycling, Fencing, Kayaking, Triple jump, Rowing, High jump, Javelin and Equestrian events. Cycling, Fencing and Rowing even allow realistic head-to-head competition. You then each choose the country you wish to represent anthems of each country are played.

There is a menu option for practicing before actually having to compete in the event which allows you to get used to the joystick control and perfect your skills at each event. SUMMER GAMES II really takes off where SUMMER GAMES left off although it is not a "must" that you own SUMMER GAMES, the original, to enjoy this excellent sequel.
