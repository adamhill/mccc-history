## THE FUTURE OF HOME COMPUTING

We have been hearing, for about a year now, about the death of the home computer industry. It seems that as the gloss has faded from video arcade games, the sales of home computers has dropped off. Is this really the end of industry as we know it? Will we be left in a few years with nothing available except high-priced, lowperformance IBM PC's and their clones? I think not. The gloom and doom soothsayers tend to overlook several important facts when they make their dire predictions.

Most importantly, the sales of home computers has not dropped off to nothing. What really happened is that sales were given a tremendous and unrealistic boost with the advent of arcade games. Many companies formed trying to take advantage of that fad. When the fad died, so many of those companies. The important thing to note, however, is that even though sales have dropped off significantly, the number of computers the hone is still on the although not at the astronomical rate that it once was. One other important fact: The number of homes which have computers is significantly greater than it would have been without arcade games. It seems that many people who bought them originally for the games have discovered since having them in their homes that there are many other useful purposes to which they can be put. Families who have

BILL RAECKE

made this discovery are likely to tell their friends who are then potential buyers. And so the trend is likely to continue exponetially once the current flat spot is past.

Another argument that is continually made is that there is no valid use for a home computer. The argument goes that once people get them into their homes, they don't know what to do with them. It may be true that there are a certain percentage of owners who never learn to use them. Perhaps they bought one to keep · up with the Joneses. Or maybe they were talked into it by a smoothtalking salesman who convinced them that all they needed to do was to plug it in and immediately their home would run itself. Maybe there has been some amount of oversell. But anyone who has used a word processor printer would scoff at a typewriter. And anyone who has used a financial package to help them make a better decision on buying a home or a car could tell you that it can pay for itself in just that one useage. (There are a lot of things banks won't tell you unless they have to). Even filling out the annual income tax forms becomes easier and more accurate when done on your computer.

There is one other identifiable reason for the current slump - one that · has recently been corrected. In the past several years there have been no major developments in home computers. The last really exciting thing to hit the market was the C64.

It was the machine that really made home computing a reality. The Macintosh came on the scene, and for a while it looked as though it had real potential for the home. But it's lack of colors, high price, and limited memory and disk space conbined to take the lustre from it almost before it got started. And so we were left with the 064. The 064 is still one of the very best computers in the market, but a high-tech industry, in order to continue to grow, must continue to develop new technologies.

Now, suddenly, all that has changed. Within the past few months we have seen the release of three new computers which are pushing the limits of technology. Atari has released the 520ST - a machine that reportedly delivers what the Macintash promised - color, more memory, and about half the price. And Commodore has released both the C128 and the Amiga. The C128 should be the new 064 of the marketplace. The 1ow price, faster disk drive with more

![Image](1985_11_artifacts/image_000004_118f46d0dee3cef8d66c0ed129003b654c241a3ebda107cf8da2422ba529aba7.png)

storage, excellent Basic, and double the memory of the C64 make it the perfect home computer. Add to that the software base already available for the 0S4 which can also be run on the C128 and I don't think it can be touched. Then, of course, there is the Amiga. The Amiga is a computer that not only pushes the limits of technology - it defines them. Things are now possible that simply weren't possible on a single computer until now. It does things that most of us computer nuts haven't dared dream about, and it does them at a price that should have users cheering and competition cursing for years to come.

The slump should be over. That portion of the slump attributable to the death of video games has past. With the advent of these new computers to bring exciting new technologies into the home, we should be seeing computer sales grow at ever-increasing speeds. We're not seeing the end of the industry - only the beginning.

COPYRIGHT 1985 BY PAUL MOTISE ROCKVILLE COMMODORE USERS GROUP

XMOBUF 7.3: In this, the second of a two-part series on XMODEM, let's look at a public domain terminal program, XMOBUF 7.3 by Chris Kaiser, that incorporates protocol. Recently offered on Compuserve, the program should now be making the BBS rounds. The program comes with an adequate doc file, which you should read before going on-line.

XMOBUF 7.3 features XMODEM and ASCII file transfers, local and host echos, 17K receive buffer, and support for a wide assortment of modems. The compiled code is swift enough to run at 300 and 1200 baud. Communication is fixed at 8 bit word size, no parity, with X-ON/X-OFF signal acknowledgement, in true ASCII. Unfortunately, disk "wedge" functions are limited to directory displays and some automatic error channel reads; you can't issue such familiar commands as scratch, rename, and validate, an omission sorely felt after aborted downloads.

XMOBUF 7.3 admirably supports many of the popular modems for the C-64. Autodial is possible on the 1650, 1660, Mitey Mo, and Hayes Westridge, compatible units. Autoanswer works on the 1650, HESII, Mitey Mo and Westridge models. However, autoanswer is merely a convenience here; the answering party must be present for things to progress beyond going on-line; this is no BBS base station program.

XMOBUF works in a fairly straightforward manner. On-screen prompts, and clear menus make it relatively easy to use. However, there are a few quirks and some procedures demand patience and care. My cohorts and I have had varying degrees of success with this program. Here's what you can expect.

At the program's outset, you must set several variables which may not be changed later. These include screen, border and text colors, printer configuration (secondary address-- the default is 7), baud rate (300 or 1200) and keyboard echo "mode". The "mode" is either BBS (no local echo) 64 to 64 (local echo). Unchangeable are word size/parity, stop

4

bits and nulls after carriage return, fact that limits XMOBUF for general telecommunications, but not for XMODEM transfers, the program's default settings. In addition, you must exit and re-run the program to reset the changeable parameters, making XMOBUF less robust than its kindred.

Once past these preliminaries, You reach terminal mode; a header, which later scrolls off the screen, reminds you of the main function key assignments; F1 invokes the main menu; F5, F7 and F8 open, close and clear the buffer respectively. The occupying a full screen, is selfexplanatory. In 64 to 64 mode there's a

The "BUF" in XMOBUF refers, of course, to the program's receive buffer. When the buffer is first turned on, a line appears saying it's opened and the number of available bytes. Another line confirms buffer closure. These sole reminders will later scroll from view, so don't forget buffer's software, XMOBUF 7.3 doesn't let you fill your buffer off-line from the keyboard, in local echo mode; there's no built-in text editor either. You must therefore use other programs (i.e., word processors) to write your text files. The buffer menu shows a thoughtful header on remaining free bytes and the number of disk blocks needed to save captured data--nice touch. Buffer menu items are fairly standard; the buffer may be displayed, printed, saved, loaded from disk, or transmitted.

main menu, a clear, double spaced slate, helpful reminder that senders go first in XMODEM exchanges.

One of the nicest features of XMOBUF is automatic transmission of operator status messages in 64 to 64 mode. Whenever you exit terminal mode, your correspondent receives a message, preceded by ";:".. as to what you're doing. For instance, you switch to main menu, the other side gets a line, ";;OTHER OPERATOR GONE TO MAIN MENU. " Similar anti-anxiety cues are forwarded when you check your directory or leap into XMODEM uploads.

The heart of XMOBUF 7. 3 is itg implementation of the XMODEM protocol. Prompts differ slightly between "modes", but transfer procedures are essentially the same. Do your preliminary work in

terminal mode; make sure the receiver is ready to stand by. Next, the sender goes to main menu and XMODEM upload. The sender is asked if the receiver is ready; a "yes" triggers a sender prompt for file name and type. Three things need to be remembered here. First, a file-not-found error, without further notice, dumps the sender to main menu. Second, enter the file type in lower case, even though the prompts are in upper case. Third, to send a Commodore ASCII sequential file without translation to true ASCII, enter "o" (for override) as the file type. The sender is then told that the first XMODEM block is read into a buffer and the system is awaiting the receiver's first NAK signal. Once the transfer begins, the sender's screen displays each consecutive block number, along with ACK/NAK signals. Note that NAK appears while a block is being sent; ACK's come after each block. Know, while bad blocks are retransmitted, it may look like nothing is happening; let XMODEM · do its thing.

On the receiving end, ";; " status lines appear in 64 mode. Refrain from jumping into download until you final cue that the sender is awaiting your NAk. Other messages cought in the pipeline when you exit terminal mode may lock up the program, or else trap you in a block 1 receive loop. So, be patient and wait a

## SQUEEZING YOUR SPREADSHEET

The problem with spreadsheets is that they spread out. You can't puts as much as you want on one page with an 80 column print out. The solution is to print in condensed mode and get 132 characters across. In order to do this, you must send a command to your to your printer BEFORE you load the spreadsheet. If you have a CARDOO interface, be sure to lock it into transparent mode first (see your manual for information on this).

## DOODLE &amp; PRINT SHOP COMBINED

If you own these excellent programs, you might like to put some PrintShop lettering on the screen, then decorate the display with Doodle's superior drawing options. If you have a machine language monitor, you can do it with ease. Let's say you wrote something with PrintShop and saved it as TEXT. Just enter your monitor and do this:

- T 4000 5F3F 6000
- L "TEXT", 08
- •F 5000 5FE7 01
- •S "DDTEXT", 08, 5000, 7F3F

Then, from Doodle, load TEXT and doodle to your heart's content. Of course, you can substitute any name for TEXT, as long as you add DD when saving it as a Doodle file. (Erik Francois)

## RE REVIEWS REVIEW

MCCC NEWS REVIEWS THE LATEST SOFTWARE COURTESY OF BABBAGE'S AND FEDERATED/VIDEOLAND

COLOR ME THE COMPUTER COLORING KIT

Mindscape, inc.

COLOR ME is definately a program that is not just for the kids. While this two disk computer coloring kit is designed to appeal to the younger set, parents will enjoy its capabilities and fresh looking cartoon characters as well.

The 56 page instruction manual is a nice change from the technical verbage that accompanies so many computer programs these days. It is written for children in a direct and simple style with numerous examples and illustrations. As with any well written program, it is almost unnecessary unless the user is totally new to computing.

COLOR ME allows you to draw pictures, designg or scribbles in 16 colors with brush sizes using either a joystick or Koala Pad. The program includes the standard features of draw, fill, erase, cut and paste, mirroX, print. COLOR ME recognizes color printers as well as black and white and will automatically shade areas when printing your color pictures on a black and white printer.

You may save your creations or borrow fron the files on the picture disk. One exceptional feature of the disk formatting proceedure for new picture disks is that the program will allow you or your child to format only blank disks. This means you will not have to worry that your children will accidently format a disk containing your checkbook data for the last year.

I was delighted by the imaginative drawings included in the picture disk (many of them used in this issue). Rather than another set of realistic drawings of Mother Goose figures, these characters have a sense of humor which appeals to many age levels.

Supporting the basic art program are four additional picture disks which you may order from the manufacturer at $9. 95 each. A COLOR ME Supply Box is also avail-

able which includes buttons, cards, colored printer paper, a ooloring book binder, and adhesive-backed printer paper for making stickers.

Be careful, though. This is a program you will find yourself playing with after the kids have gone to bed. You may also find your husband working on COLOR ME instead of that spreadsheet he loves!

## HORLD B GREATEBT FOOTBALL BAME Epur Boftware

If you are an avid football fan, take a look at The World's Greatest Football Game. This may not be the world's greatest computer football game but it certainly is the most thorough of any I have seen.

instructions include both general manual and a playbook. The manual not well written and ambiguous unless you read the entire 9 pages to understand the total operation of the program.

The playbook is excellent-all diagrams in football terms and computer mapped positions on the screen. Here's a list of what you'll find.

* 53 Offensive &amp; Defensive Formations
* 25 Offensive Receiver Routes
* 22 Offensive Blocking Routes and Quarterback Routes
* 53 Offensive Blocking Routes
* 9 Man on Man Routes
* 11 Defensive Line Routes
* 54 Defensive Back Routes

Once you have mastered the varied commands and sequences that it requires to even have an opening kickoff, the game will play much faster. Designed for one or two players, the game features a dual screen view of the field that can be toggled in and out.

Just as some word processors or music synthesizers can be too difficult for some of us, The World's Greatest Football Game is designed for the expert. If only it included a feature for instant replays!

## BTUNT FLYER BIERRA SOFTHARE

Strap yourself into the cockpit of the world's most maneuverable aircraft - the Pitts Special, and experience the · sane exhileration that. thrilled the daring barstormers of the past.

The game comes complete with a thick instruction manual that will help you familiarize yourself with the controls that maneuver the aircraft and the gauges monitor performance. Consult the manual for a review of the principles of flying. Then, visit the Stunt Flyer Airshow for an aerobatics demonstration.

The game is not the best flying game I have seen but it does have several good features not found on other games. The replay and judging options are unique and it is : fun to watch as you perfect your skill.

## VIEH TO KILL THE COMPUTER GAME DOMARK SOFTHARE

DOMARK SOFTWARE has just released this great 007 game which is actually three games in one. You play the role of the famous super spy JAMES BOND, 007. The first part of the game is the PARIS CHASE in which BOND must chase the assassin May Day, who leaps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and glides around the streets of Paris. As you can, tell if you have seen the movie, the story follows the game quite closely and is full of action.

The other two parts of the game, that must be played in order, are equally as interesting and challenging as the first part. The final part - THE SILICON VALLEY MINE is very similiar to Impossible Mission by Epyx Software.

The game has one drawback which some players may see as a challenge. It has several obscure symbols that are difficult to gee at timeg and even more difficult to

7

remember. This drawback, however, 1s enough to keep this game from being excellent. There is also some good speech sythesis in the game!

## FABT TRACKB: COMPUTER BLOT CAR CONBTRUCTION KIT ACTIVISION SOFTHARE

Create the most outrageous slot car tracks and experience the thrill of racing them. You can even send your tracks to friend and challenge him to beat your best times. The package even includes a customized disk and mailer at no extra cost.

The game consist of a construstion kit very similar to the game by ELECTRONIC ARTS called RACING DESTRUCTION SET. There are also several pre-built tracks on which you have complete control over speed and braking. All racing controls are Joystick controlled. If the course you construct is not tough enough, there is no reason to start over, just go back and change it. This package comes complete with everything you need for days of enjoyment. This is a game I recommend, not only because of the excellent game play and graphics but also because it allows you to create your own games!

## врУ ув зру YOL. The IBLAND CAPER

## An Electronic Novel A Synapse &amp; Broderbund Production

Monday evening as I boarded the spaceship Essex for the outer galaxies, I literally stumbled over the body of a dying man. With his final breath, he told me to give a letter to Commodore (?) Norton. I searched all night for the Commodore and never found him; but I did meet the Hamster People the planet Malphormalleh and Queen Betuna.

An electronic novel is much like a text adventure game, but is more complex. It also plays a little slower. The decisions made by the reader and the ensuing dialogue with the characters determine how the novel unfolds. Essex responds to a wide variety of commands as it has a vocabulary of 1200 words.

Your place in the game can be saved (bookmark command), a printed record of your progress through the game can be generated, and time and action can be sped up (time faster command). Included with the two disks (three are instructions in the form of a hard cover novel, complete with dust jacket, plus a quick reference card.

Synapse and Broderbund are promising two more novels: Mindwheel and Brimstone. I am looking forward to reading them.

## KORONIE RIFT EPYX SOFTHARE

KORONIS RIFT is another in the Lucas Film Series of games which are quickly gaining a reputation for exceptional graphics. In this game you explore the fabled Koronis Rift. On a remote backwater planet enveloped in deadly radiation, and so the story begins!

As a rough and tumble technoscavenger, you'll contend against hostile alien guards and vanquish them by destroying their powerful base. To survive, yOu must seize weapons and shields from abandoned ancient space hulks.

This is the first real fantasyadventure game I have seen that has been excellently translated into 64 graphics and sound and still retained it's identity. If you liked the other new Epyx Software game THE EIDOLON you should also enjoy this one!

Remember, November 16 is chapter election day!-Mary Louise Hagemeyer

Our next meeting will be November 16 at 1:30 pm in Room 2 at GDRA. The speaker will be Glenn Baird, describing a plotting program he has written which wedges into Basic to add many useful graphics and printing commands. We will have some demonstrations of library disks, too.

The Arlington Chapter will meet 10: 00 AM, November 9, at the Downtown Arlington Library. Pat MoCoy will present a program on the Fleet System II word processor. Business will include nominations for next year's chapter officers. -Jonathan Riba
