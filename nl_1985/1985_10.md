The new Commodore 128 is adyertised being "3 computers in one, " since it has a 064 mode, a C128 mode, and a CP/M mode.

However, is so powerful the C128 mode by itself so many for the BASIC programmer) that I wonder how many folks will bother much with the other two "flavors" the computer can offer.

Between the 80 column display and improved screen editor, the C128 offers much more flexibility. That flexibility is available to both the BASIC programmer the machine language hacker, thanks to the builtin machine language monitor and a rich

The overall organization of the C128 running in it's native mode is quite different from previous Commodore computers. Things just aren't where they used to be. To get us strated on our tour of the 128's innards, here is an overall memory тар:

## ТНЕ САРТЕЙ MEETING: PRES I DENT 'S YIEH by Dauid Rye

"Twas the night before the meeting and all was going well. Two speakers were scheduled and confirmed; all the equipment would be there.

So, on the afternoon of the day of the meeting, everyone was getting prepared. Tony Velez and Laura Clements were setting up the library with the new library assistant, a lovely lady named Cheryl Howard. Bruce Nelson was setting out disks and caps.

Roger Hoggard and Randy Kusiv were setting up their wares. Alice and I were setting up chairs. Jerry Hull was there with his catalog system to share.

We were all looking forward to seeing a C128 Deno D'Angeli from Federated Videoland. But where was he? He said all was ready just last night. But what about today at 1:23 p.m.? well, he was at work.

![Image](1985_10_artifacts/image_000007_325d113251829942565caf9f0cc5cae1b2c04b99e2b975be816367ef5f5580c9.png)

So with a borrowed monitor from one and cables from another, Roger said he would helps us recover. (Mike loaned us a NEW C-128 Spreadsheet program to show.) Both demos were great even if we were a little late!

Thanks to all who helped us to have another good meeting. Thanks to Roger Hoggard for stepping in. And thanks to all who helped with the chairs.

I guess it was appropriate that Jerry's program was one to help us get lour disks) organized. See you next time.

## LERRNING ABOUT YOUR COMMODORE

I know that much of our membership is composed of new computer owners. I also know that many of you feel overwhelmed by all the information you are asked to absorb and are confused about where to get the answers you need. This article ig for you. There is a wealth of information available if you just know where to look or who to ask.

primary sources of information should be your MOC chapter meeting. Don't be afraid to ask questions. At least half of the people present at our are beginners just like you who want to know the answers to the very same questions. The big advantage of asking at the meeting is that there are many people available to answer. If one person doesn't probably Remember, the only dumb question is the one that is never asked.

Another good source of information are thẹ club officers. Stop us after the meeting or call us at home - that's why our phone numbers are published. If we don't know the answers to your questions, as seems to happen to me quite often lately, we will try to refer you to someone else.

There is one other major forum within the club for getting your questions answered. - our MOC Bulletin Board. The Message Base is an excellent place to leave a question.

So much for questions. What if you don't know the questions? First, attend meetings and absorb what you can. Second, read. There are several excellent magazines available for the Commodore. Most have articles designed for beginning users as well as experienced programmers and all of them will help keep you abreast of the latest software and hardware. A great I know about my Commodore was learned from reading magazines. Most of what I know about programming was learned from typing in programs from magazines. They are an invaluable source of information. Check the reference guide that follows for names and addresses just in case you can't find them in the local magazine racks.

BILL RAECKE

Above all, don't give up. Computing is fun.

XMIDEM: If you have ever transferred programs to or from Commodore bulletin boards, chances are that you used the Punter protocol. However, that protocol is specific to Commodore machines, and won't get you very far in file swaps with nonCommodore computers such as Apples, or the mainframes run by the likes of Compuserve. (Compuserve, by the way, is runored to be working on a Punter emulation system, but don't hold your breath.) It is nonetheless possible to upload download machines, and to do so with errox checking similar to that in the Punter routine. honored by several terminal prograns for the C-64 (e.g., XMODEMEA, and XMOBUF 7.3). Anyone who gets into telecommunications will, sooner later, encounter the venerable XMODEM; so, let's take a closer look at what it is, exactly how it and how to get the most from it. This will be the first of a two-part series. month we will examine the protocol itself, and next time we'll explore one of better public domain terminal programs for the C-64 which uses XMODEM.

First of all, XMODEM is a file transfer protocol, a set of rules within a communications program, used by parties to exchange disk files. exchange is executed by an established error checking routine that, while not foolproof, nonetheless offers the receiver a high probability of winding up with a true copy of the sender's file. XMODEM was originally developed by telecomputing pioneer Ward Christensen, and is sometimes named after its author.

The strongest point of XMODEM, in my view, 1s that it is the closest thing we to a universal or "generic" error checking protocol. XMODEM is part of numerous programs, public domain and commercial, written for various computers. As a result, quite different computers, running different terminal programs, ponor swap files as long as both sides the rules. I've used XMODEM to send files

6

to an IBM PC and I several of my cohorts have traded files with an Apple II. Probably the most exciting development for C-64 owners, however, " is Compuserve's recent adoption of XMODEM in its Commodore download section; it's now possible to download executable programs directly, without the intermediate conversion hassles found in image and "ASCII listing" transfers.

There are, of course, limitations to what XMODEM can do. The protocol helps to assure error-free transmission of programs, but does not convert programs written for one machine to code that will run on a completely different beast. A program you download must be compatible with your equipment in the first place, or it won't run. This means that a program uploaded by XMODEM to an IBM PC will arrive in pristine shape, but will not work on Big Blue's computer. However, ordinary ASCII text files (without printer control codes) can be exchanged and easily read.

Here's how XMODEM works. To begin with, both parties must communicate at 8 bit word size, no parity. The most important thing to remember about the transfer itself is that the sender goes into the hold for start loop first. In this holding pattern, the sender waits for the receiver to transmit a NAK signal (negative acknowledge, ASCII value 21. ) The receiver must emit the NAK periodically, usually once every 10 seconds, to get things rolling. Once the sender grabs onto the inital NAK, the whole shebang gets underway. A file is transmitted in a series of blocks, each consisting of header, 128 data bytes, and a checksum. The header begins with an SOH character (meaning start of header, ASCII value 1), followed by the block number and the ASCII value for one's compliment (1's and O's reversed) of the block number. The 128 data bytes are next. Trailing the data is the ASCII value for the checksum of all data bytes. (Don't confuse an XMODEM block with the Commodore disk block. )

The receiver's terminal program is kept busy with housekeeping chores to make sure everything is in order, as the block arrives. The first character is checked to see if it is, in fact, an SOH. The block number is examined next to make certain it's in the correct sequence. Then the

data bytes are tallied, with the resultant checksum compared to the checksum received. If there are no header discrepancies, and if the suns match, the receiver calls for the next block by sending an ACK signal (acknowledge, value 6.) Errors, on the other hand, cause the receiver to say, in effect, "what was that again?" by calling for a re-transmission of the errant block; the request is made by sending NAK. Most prograns will try resending problem blocks several times before giving up in total frustration. What you need to keep in mind is that if your download dies in progress, you will wind up with an incomplete file that should be deleted from your disk.

To get the most from XMODEM, be patient. Transfers are slow compared to other protocols. Recognize, too, that although the protocol itself is standardized, the parent terminal programs are not, meaning program prompts may differ from caller to caller. Thus, you may receive different "go to download" messages, depending on your partner's program. Furthermore, some C-64 programs perform painfully slow buffer fills for each block, causing "time-out" messages on some non-Commodore systems; your correspondent may thereby be misled into thinking something has gone amiss. To catastrophy, conduct preliminary "chats" in terminal mode, and be certain the receiver will stand by as the sender goes into the hold loop. Because XMODEM loses reliability at higher baud rates, you should stay with 300 baud. Finally, reserve XMODEM for non-Commodore links; use Punter's routines for Commodore to Commodore exchanges whenever possible.

When the end of the file is succesefully reached, the sender shouts hooray by · tossing an EOT character (end of transmission, ASCII value 4), to which the receiver salutes with an ACK. Fortunately, all of this accounting and signal exchanging is handled automatically by the respective terminal programs. All you need do is follow your program's prompts and hope for the best. Most programs display status lines of some sort, during the actual transfer, so both sides know how things are going, block by block, ACK by NAK.

All in all, XMODEM is a valuable protocol, one that should be in at least one of your telecommunication programs; it

7

lets you confidently swap data with nonCommodore computers. In part two of this saries, we'll review XMOBUF 7.3, a public domain terminal program for the C-64 which incorporates the XMODEM protocol.

MCCC NEWS REVIEWS THE LATEST SOFTWARE COURTESY OF BABBAGE'S AND FEDERATED/VIDEOLAND

BENBE MICROTECHNIC BOLUTIONS. INC.

By Laura Clements

If you want to add a little meat to your modem, try Sixth Sense, Microtechnic Solutions, Inc. The features of this program exceed those of Firstterm, Vidtex, or VIP Term.

The first thing to be done upon opening the package, is to prepare to spend at least two evenings digesting the documentation. The problem is not one of length as it is poor arrangement. For example, when trying to find out the size of the buffer, the only place found with the word "buffer" listed was the glossary. (The buffer turned out to be 700 lines.) Nowhere in the documentation is there a start up tutorial. However, this program is obviously meant for the advanced telecommunicator, not for just a beginner, The program will support one or two 1541 drives, the 4040 drive, and both of the MSD drives. It is compatible with the 1525 and 1526 printers, and any interfaced ASCII printer.

The Sixth Sense program claims to work with the Commodore 1600, 1650, 1660, 1670, Westridge, Mitey Mo, HesModem I and II and any RS-232 modem. (I used the program to call up StarText with my Telelearning modem. )

The 700 line virtual screen buffer allows for a two-way fast search by line and page. This buffer can be saved to a disk or printed as hardcopy.

There are 16 help screens which allows the user to access the submenus. The status line at the bottom of the screen shows 13 different items, including line number, delay, X-on/off flag, printer, disk write and read channels, 24 hour clock counter, etc.

There are 16 macros that are programmable through the function keys and can handle up to 80 characters per key. System functions can be programmed into these macros and conditional tests can be set.

Text files for uploading can be created through the screen editos, which will also allow editing of downloaded files. Utility routines for text- toprogram conversion and vice versa are provided. It allows DOs wedge commands, the handling of ASCII/PETASCII text, XModem or Compuserve-B protocol modes.

This program could be overkill for the beginning or parttime telecommunicator, but for the person who spends hours every evening exploring the world of BBS's, the Sixth Sense would be ideal. It will not, however, work with the MOCC BBS.

## TEMPLE OF APBHAI TRILOGY EPYX SOFTWARE

Games and Pitstop. The TEMPLE OF APSHAI TRILOGY is an excellent remake of three 222 EPYX SOFTWARE is famous for great as Summer EPYX SOFTWARE originals, Temple of Apshai, The Upper Reaches of Apshai and The Curse of Ra. The original games were considered "state of the art" in their day were honored by several awards. As everyone knows programming has come a long way in the areas of graphics and sound! The enhancements added by Epyx reflect this very well.

The characters are the same in the Trilogy as in the originals including The Innkeeper, The Dwarf, The Cleric and The Magic User. There are 12 levels, 568 rooms and over 35 different monsters to keep you occupied throughout the game. The games feature advanced hires graphics, quality music and faster game play which is the biggest plus over the originals. If have not played the originals you you will still enjoy the Trilogy. If you were a lover of the Temple of Apshai you will like the Trilogy even more.

## HACKER AÇTIVISION

HACKER is a totally new type of adventure game which comes with absolutely no instructions other than how to load the program. The premise is that you have stumbled into somebody else's computer system and you are someplace that you're really not supposed to be. "Logon please: " is all you get to start with. From there, it's up to you although the rules will become obvious after your first few tries and hints are given freely.

HACKER will involve you in several different puzzles at the same time. It is basically a graphic adventure that you control by joystick and one letter commands. You will also need to map a simple maze and use your memory, strategy and, above all, logic skills to solve this layered set of puzzles. It has a nice amount of humor and authenticity. In Switzerland you are spoken to in French, etc.

HACKER is sometimes unpredictable and the graphics are excellent. It is visual, intellectual and creative. This is one of the very few games I have become excited about (to the point of not being able to put it down) and it is definately one of the best games I have seen this year.

## THE HALLEY PROJECT SOFTHARE

THE HALLEY PROJECT: A mission in our solar system. You're at the controls of your spaceship and your mission is to qualify for the HALLEY PROJECT, a top secret exploration that only the most elite star pilots will be ask to join. To prove you qualify, P.L.A.N.E.T. requires you to use your knowledge of the solar system to locate and land on planets moons. If all this sounds difficult, it is. This game has several good in fact it is a good game overall but it must be played in segments and each one could take hours to conplete. This is not just another arcade-type space game. THE HALLEY PROJECT is a yery good game but I would not recommend it for children under the age of 12.

## GOLDEN OLDIEB BOFTHARE COUNTRY Distr'buted by Electronic Arts

It surprises me that Electronic Arts would put it's name on a piece of software that is as bad as GOLDEN OLDIES. The attractive packaging leads you to believe new enhancements to four classic computer games are outstanding. '"... We have included an alternative version (of each game) that takes full advantage of your modern microcomputer's capabilities. " This statement is far fron accurate. (See article in this issue about advertising and warranties.)

The Pong game, for example, uses the open circle character from the keyboard and moves by printing, erasing and reprinting itself as it crosses the screen very slowly. No clever three dimensional sprites here.

This is characteristic of all the 'improved' games on this disk. Programming the enhancements would not challenge the average 6th grader to reproduce on a VIC20 in one evening. Don't waste your software. allowance on this one.

## HOT HHEELB EPYX SOFTHARE

Like BARBIE, HOT WHEELS will never take the place of the real thing but it does allow options only available on a computer. Children will enjoy picking out their favorite Hot Wheels car and customizing it in many different ways. You can paint your car to order or visit the factory to custom build a car. During the game you will take your car to the paint car wash, parking garage and even the demolition derby! You can perform routine maintenance and repairs such as tune-ups and oil changes. There is also a segment where you can become a firefighter with your own hookand-ladder truck. All these activities in one game make this the best driving game for younger children who may not have skill or the interest to play the adult driving games.

Note: With the recent popularity of vechicles that turn into robots, I fully expect to see another game for youngsters next week called "Go-Bots"!

when using the OPEN statment to open the R5-232 port (modem), you must use both the command reg. and the control reg. Example:

An easy way to use the DLOAD command to load from the directory is to reprogram Fz to read KEY2, "DLOAD[17cursor rights]:". This will place the colon after the file name to prevent a syntax exror if you load from the directory.
