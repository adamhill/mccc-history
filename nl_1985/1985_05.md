## PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

Anyone helplessly listening to their disk their back drive self-destruct by banging itself against the stop while trying load piece of software has been frustrated, by the software industry's practice of copy-protecting their software. As with most subjects, I have strong opinions on copy protection. I thought that I would take this opportunity to share them with you.

First, what It is copy protection? is the industry's attempt to insure that no one except the person who actually purchased the program uses it. It has been estimated that with annual revenues from software sales at $2.2 billion, an additional $800 million in annual revenues is being lost to piracy. Software companies, in order to reduce to size of that 1055, spend millions of dollars coming up with ways to insure that copies cannot be made of their software. This is most often done by adding errors to disks intentionally and then having the program check the existence of those errors before it will run. Lately: some of the larger companies have gone to more

BILL RAECKE

elaborate schemes such as putting valid data "under" the errors.

And so it goes, round and round. New schemes are developed to protect software and new methods are developed to copy it anyway, Who benefits? Certainly not the purchaser! he pays an inflated price for the software he buys to cover the costs of developing the new software protection scheme. Not the software manufacturer either: a new copy program is always available to pirates as soon as his software hits the shelves and his software is copied at just about the same rate as it would have been without the latest scheme. The only people who really benefit from the entire process are the manufacturers of copy programs.

to Thind is pati whether these efforts have been successful. So far they have not. Each time a new scheme is developed for protecting a disk from being copied, a new program is developed which can copy it anyway. We have all seen ads in the backs of the popular computing magazines selling the latest "nibblers". are these Why copy programs allowed? Because, by copy protecting their software, these software companies are infringing on an owners' legal right to make back-up copies of a program he has purchased. The problem is that these programs are as readily accessible to pirates as they are to anyone elsa.

So, what is the answer? First, Cont'd on Page 3

Before I start, let me make it clear that in no way do I or the MCCC condone the illegal duplication of copyrighted software. That is, and will remain, strictly against the club rules. But copy protection schemes and illegal copies have very little to do with each other as I will try to examine.

## PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

copy protection schemes should be eliminated. Copy protection not only is wasteful, it infringes an owners legal right to make his own back-up copies. It is also, in some respects, counter-productive. There are some pirates who enjoy nothing better than challenge eliminating \_ a new protection method. By simply eliminating the challenge, some piracy could be eliminated. Secondly, software prices should be set at a level consistent with the quality of the product being marketed. Almost all software currently being overpriced. Prices have begun to decline recently but they still have a way to go. $25 to $35 is a lot of money to pay for game. $15 would make a lot more sense from a value-received standpoint and would boost sales tremendously.

There are signs it might now all be changing. In fact there are some companies which have сору protected their software, Infocom for one, and have not seemed to have suffered unduly from not doing so. I applaud them for their good sense. I also recently purchased a program from Value Plus software which I will be adding to our club library shortly. They freely allow copies to be made of their software. The only request being that if you intend to use the program, please send $10.

What lies on the horizon is anyone's guess. All I can do is hope that good sense will prevail. Until it does, we can all continue to spend money on programs which allow us to make copies to which we are legally entitled anyway (watching ·Сору program manufacturers get rich) and listening to oLIr disk drives self-destruct.

Imagine if you will, your ultimate disk drive.

I don't know about you, but mine would store a lot. Perhaps it could replace 30 or 40 of my current diskettes and hold all that at once. That would be nice. I'd never have to go looking for a program again. Paperclip, Vizastar, Loderunner, Superbase, Logo - they'd all be on this same wondrous diskette. Just turn on the computer, tell it what to load, and I know it would be there.

This drive would be faster, too, and maintenance free. And the cost even with all these improvements - should be reasonable: $500 or less.

What I want is a hard disk drive.

Do you want one? If all the above could be achieved, of course you would.

There's only one problem. The people at Commodore don't think you do. That's why they aren't working on any hard disk drives for the C64 or even the new C128. To quote a Commodore spokesperson, " ·..right now when the sales of disk drives to home computers are only JUST stabilizing at one-for-one, I still find it hard to believe that people will buy disk drives that require another disk drive in order think you wanted a disk it you wanted drive of any sort. They were under the impression that the Datasette would be more than adequate. And that's why there was a shortage of 1541 drives a year or two ago.

There are now some small third-party companies who have perceived enough of a market for hard disks to begin making CBM-compatible drives. Most of these announced products store between 10 and 25 megabytes of data and will cost from $1200 to $2000.

The problem with these products will be cost. I think the Commodore spokesman was right when he told me that at $1200 (or more) there won't be many buyers. However, hard drives needn't cost that much.

First reason: Over at Atari, Jack Traneil is hard at work on a 10-15

megabyte drive that will cost 400 to 600 dollars.

Second reason: the $99 ad in Byte. A number of discount computer suppliers have begun advertising a hard disk for just $99. It's a 5 megabyte drive without power supply, cabinet, Or controller circuitry, but it's a price breakthrough nevertheless.

It shouldn't be to hard to put together a $100 hard disk in a cheap plastic cabinet with some CBM-compatible electroics, sell the package for $400 or still make a profit. Somebody should it, ideally Commodore themselves. If the prospect appealing, write to CBM's corporate headquarters and tell them so.

It's cheap beacause 5-meg storage is considered too little for business use. But at of home - why that's the equivelent 30 absoultely crammed-full floppies. Enough for my needs...

After all, my CBM spokesman also said, "if we can show a real demand for hard drives for the 64/128, then I am sure that one will be produced at a reasonable price by someone."

## FORT WORTH

The next meeting of the fort Worth Chapter will be Saturday. May 18, at the GDRA at 1:30 PM. We will have a demonstration of the 1520 plotter. We also hope to have a review of some educational programs by Technologies. - Randy Jellison Learning

## FW NIGHT CHAPTER

Another great modem demonstration by David Wiley is scheduled for the May 20th meeting of the FW Night Chapter.

Our chapter will be selling a 14 page catalog of the club's library disks for $1.25 (printing cost) at the next meeting. The club library of disks is also available ON DISK fros the chapter librarian. Thanks to all who participated in updating the library catalog. - Bruce Umbreit

We would like to thank Bob Lawson for his work and generosity in donating a full disk of utility programs to the club. (See New Library Disks) In addition to the disk catalog program and games disk, Bob has written a series of directory printing programs primarily for the 1525 printers. Bill Jones has rewritten "Tiny Directory" to facilitate enhanced print modes for the newer 1526/802 printers.

## ARLINGTON

A proposal to create and maintain a club bulletin board was overwhelmingly approved at the Quarterly Meeting, April 20. The BBS will be open to members only to allow maximum access to the users. Members desiring the services of a BBS are being asked to contribute $10 a year to cover the expenses. Chapter officers are now accepting and applications fees for this new service. Specific details of the service are nOW being planned and the excitment over this new project is quite high among officers and members alike. It is hoped that the system will be in operation within the next month.

Proposed features of the MCCC BBS include electronic mail, classified ads, a current and accurate calendar of events as well as the latest information about Commodore products. The BBS could provide the club leadership a method of keeping in touch with members on a more personal basis. Information for publication could be sent to the newsletter staff in a more efficient manner. Easy access to · expert help with your computer problems and periodic public domain downloads comprise only a few of the benefits.

If this sounds exciting to you, why not become a charter member and sign up at your next chapter meeting. A minimum of 60 member families is required to begin the purchase of equipment. Let's get things rolling. Don't delay.

A BAUDY STORY.

user group member contemplated who purchase of a new modem once asked me if 1200 baud unit was "the way to go". Implied was that 1200 was better than cheaper high speed modems enter the market, 1200 baud units are within our grasp. Before we reach out for the new toys, let's take closer look at baud rates and see if 1200 is indeed the way to go.

Baud rate is a measure of data transmission speed. For trivia buffs, originally capabilities telegraph equipment and was named after J.M.E. Baudot, inventor of the Baudot telegraph code. Baud rate technically, the signal events on a line, per second; a 1 or being such an event. The rate is approximately equal to the number bits per second. I say approximately because at 300 baud, for example, milliseconds are allowed for each 3.33 1 or O--the unit of time when a voltage signal will either be high or low. For our purposes, it is acceptable to equate baud rate with bits per second. Now you can impress your friends at the next cocktail party--it's not EXACTLY bits per second because.....This will awe your techie friends everyone else. and totally alienate Anyway, even though 300 baud sounds fast, we can only transmit 30 characters per second at this rate. That's because 10 bits are needed for each character: one start bit, either 7 data bits plus a parity bit or 8 data bits with no parity, and a stop bit.

With the advent of cheaper 1200 baud modems such as the Volksmodem 12 by Anchor Automation (under $300) or Commodore's forthcoming 1670 funder $100 ?), does it pay to go for 1200? Before you decide, consider this. A 1200 baud unit requires the speed of machine 1 anguage programs. BASIC programs are only fast enough to keep LIp with 300 baud. A 1200 rate pushes the technical capacity of voice grade phone lines to the limit: higher speeds are more vulnerable to line noise. Next, pay services charge more for 1200 baud accessi usually on-line rates are twice those for 300. Remember, though, that while the charges may double, your communication is four times faster. So pays, right? Not quite! If you spend most of your on-line time in interactive chats, forget 1200. First, your typing speed will never be high enough to take advantage of 1200. Furthermore, if your blasting some your screen at 1200 baud, chances are it will scroll by so fast you won't be able to read it. On the other hand, if you transfer long files a great deal of the 1200 may be of value. Keep in mind that while hte Punter Protocol runs fine at 300 baud, we don't know how it will perform at higher speeds.

Most bulletin boards and info services readily accept 300 baud, else accomodate both 300 and 1200 by sensing your speed upon log on; therefore, most services will still be available to you no matter how the 1200 baud units proliferate. However, a BBSs, notably some IBM PC stations, purposely run only at 1200 baud to keep out the 300 baud riffraff. In addition, that some interesting" Commodore BBSs have "underground" by switching over to 1200 baud. Therefore a faster modem may be the key that unlocks some exclusive doors. All in all, I believe that for the most home telecommunication purposes, 300 baud is more than adequate and will remain the norm for some time.

## CSM ALIGNMENT DISK

BY CRAIG BLACKMAN

Catalina Commodore Computer Club Tucson, Arizona

Wow, wouldn't it be nice to have a disk drive program to help align your drive. I thought so too. After reading a glowing report in Çompute's Gazette I sent in my $39.95 plus shipping and handling charges and set out to align my disk drive. Wall, after my experiences, I can't recommend the CSM ALIGNMENT DISC.

I aligned two drives using the CSM method and they were both over one quarter track off. To check, the drives were first aligned with the CSM program and then Tom D'Angelo put them on his scope to check the alignment against the Dysan alignment disc. really bad this program might give you an approximate alignment. Maybe good enough to read most of your programs but they will load slow and your friends may not be able to read your disks. I tried to align one of the drives for a third time speed check was only slightly better showing a true 100% to be 100.34%.

## SUPERWEDGE 3 ROGER INGERSOLL

Do yOU have a disk full of utilities that you can never find when you need them? Are you frustrated at. the linits of your wedge program? Would OLI like all of our utilities in one program, a program that takes almost no basic memory? Read on.

Introducing SUFERWEDGE 3. the wedge that will take the place of all your other wedges and utilities. Within one program is housed DOS wedge, auto line numbering and renumbering, a disk copy routine, un-new, a text editor, micromon and much more.

This article is not to explain how to use the functions of SUPERWEDGE 3, but merely to introduce it to you. It will soon be available in the MCCC library on the disk named "Compuserve DL #1". As its name implies, these programs were mostly downloaded from Compuserve from the 64 special interest group. Over a period of several months downloading and trying out programs, I compiled a disk of useful programs for everyone. Included on this disk are several programs for the Koala Pad and several music selections. The "read me first" file explains these programs. If you do not have a sequential file reader, never fear; SUPERWEDGE is here. Use the command "*P:filename" to read a sequential file to screen or printer.

SUPERWEDGE 3 is loaded with a , B basic load. An 8 page documentation fileis included and named "doc. superwedge". Please ignore the section about a loader program; this requirement has been dropped from the first twca versions. The documentation is simple and easy to understand. My congratulations and thanks to Jim Klitzing writing this excellent program and making it available to public domain.

All comments are appreciated. Compuserve ID is 72416,3223 and My Jim Klitzing's ID is 75206,2536.

## A COMPARATIVE REVIEW OF THE MUSIC STUDIO BY ACTIVISION AND THE MUSIC SHOP BY BRODERBUND BY BARBARA CRAMER

A good music processor is as important to a musician as a word processor is to a writer or secretary. Whether your goal 15 to compose or simply arrange the work of others, your primary tool is the music processor.

The past six months have witnessed a nice variety of software for the amateur and knowledgable musician alike. The MUSIC SHOP and The MUSIC STUDIO are two recent additions to the shelves at Babbage's. Both are excellent programs with some dramatic differences and some noteable improvements over their predecessors.

MUSIC STUDIO and MUSIC SHOP are aimed at the serious musician who is familiar with music notation, although their literature would dispute this opinion. Both programs facilitate the easy entry of notes directly to the staff in a complete and professional manner. Both offer the ability to produce a manuscript on your Commodore or compatable printer.

I have always felt a good chart is worth at least two pages of review verbage. The following is a comparison some of the major considerations important in selecting à music processor.

A music program that gives you more control will be one that you will use for a longer period of time. In my opinion, THE MUSIC SHOP is well worth the additional cost.

## ALICE IN VIDEOLAND

Alice in Videoland is revolutionary new type of game for the Commodore 64, incorporating some of the finest graphics ever seen un any home computer, accompanied by a charming musical score. There are four games in one with Alice different in Videoland. Each game or scene affects your ability in future scenes and determines your eventual total score.

In scene one the title screen scrolle as Alice walks along and stumbles into the rabbit hole where the game begins. Points are scored there by collecting objects such as baskets, keys, cakes, and bottles. In order to hold more than one object Alice must first grab a basket. In scene two there is a garden with a giant "Cheshire Cat" who looks on as Alice meets the pipe smoking caterpillar. In scene three Alice is a pawn in a chess game where her opponents are the Jabberwocky and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. In the final scene, scene four, the most bizzare croquet game ever takes place. During this scene you must help Alice hit the balls through the playing-card soldier hoops before the Queen-of-Hearts stomps on them!

The game had excellent play but I would not suggest this for anyone under 7 or 8 years old although they are probably the ones that would be most familiar with the theme. Alice in Videoland is still an excellent value at just over $ 20.00.

## ALPINE ADVENTURE

The Alpine Encounter, Random House Software's first effort in this area, is sPY thriller graphics adventure program that is designed to be enjoyed by the entire family.

As an international undercover agent, you have just 12 hours to recover the stolen blueprints to the world's first truly invincible missle! And thats Mow the story starts. The screens are full of color and you can switch the picture in and out to read a full sreen of text. All the clues you need to get the blueprints back are hidden within the luxurious ALPENHOF SKI RESORT. You check into the resort to start to solve the mystery and thwart the evil plans of a sinister, but brillantly masterminded organization.

The adventure includes over 90 screens which include some very well drawn graphics. However, do not be misled by the graphics on the box cover which were photographed from the Apple version. The graphics good but not nearly as great as the pictures imply.

Alpine Encounter an exciting sequence of skiing. Similiar to an arcade game you grip the joystick and begin your adventure and pursuit of the plans by skiing downhill at runaway speeds.

One other unique function is the ability to chart your progress by typing the word "PRINTER". When typed the entire adventure up to the point your at is dumped to the printer allowing you to chart your progress.

With Alpine Encounter there is no quick and easy solution, so be prepared to spend some time solving the mystery.

## KENNEDY APPROACH

Kennedy Approach IS NOT A FLIGHT SIMULATOR. out of the way we can start to take a look at what appears to be MicroProse Softwares best offering yet for the Commodore 64!

In Kennedy Approach player takes of an Air Traffic Controller trying to control the planes-landing and taking off-at various airports across the USA. Im the simulation there are several things to deal with including bad weather, in-flight emergencies, instrument failures and an ever. changing enviroment. The game plays very well and is also very easy to control provided you have read the in depth instructions. After all, you can't learn to control air traffic over night! This game also Claims to be the first simulation with "realistic high-quality speech right from your computer", and in my opinion they are not exaggerating the speech is GREAT and is used well to simulate real situations. The speech allows you to hear both the plane's radio calls and your own broadcast messages as the controller. Another unique feature 15 that a11 functions can be controlled from the joystick once you have enterd the game. The simulation has several different aircraft for you to control along with the normal control commands of headings, elevations and landings.

Overall the game is an excellent simulation and is accompanied by some of the best documentation I have seen (The instructions are not overpowering and full of useless information). I expect to "hear" more from the company that provided the speech programming, ELECTRONIC SPEECH SYSTEMS of BERKLEY, CALIFORNIA, they deserve half the credit for this very fine simulation!

## ? ALTERNATE START?

Garry Wordelman has told us many times about the Cold Start (SYS64738) whereby you can reset the C64 without turning it off or installing a reset button. However, what if you do not want to wipe out the program and start all over?

Ron Brandy of the b4 Users Group in Dallas has found a solution. "Quite by accident I discovered the answer. I couldn't remember SYS64738 so I tried several combinations, finally settling on SYS64538. This will clear the screen, go back to the · basic dark blue/light blue READY state, but leave the memory intact. If you have garbaged up the sprite graphics in the program or interrupted a music routine before POKING off the sound, SYS64538 will wipe out the sprites, turn off the sound and return you to the READY state. You may still list the original program abd RUN it again. Memory has not been touched."

It looked like it had good graphics from the picture on the box, but how well does it play chess? MYCHESS II a new chess game from DATAMOST the makers of KWIK-LOAD and KWIK-RITE appear to have done it again!

The only way to objectively look at computer chess game would be to, a book compare it to other chess games and what they have to offer. First let me clarify · games cd what I am not a chess expert and don't care to be. It would seem that chess is chess and there is not a whole lot difference in the way each chess game plays as far as rules and stratagies. the way to produce a President "BETTER" than the rest one would have to resort to making a quality chess game with a gimic! Imagine playing chess with your computer in 3-D, or if you want you can play in 2-D which in my opinion was alot easier to distinguish Treasurer Secretary Librarian Ed. Chrmn. where the pieces were. The graphics on the 3-D view were good although at times it was hard to tell the precise location of each piece. This is easily remedied EDITORS by switching between the 2-D and 3-D modes. MYCHESS I also highlights all potential legal moves which makes it interesting for a novice. The games can
