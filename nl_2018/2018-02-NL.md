## Bubsy: Kitt'N Kaboodle for Vic20

This fun hack of Fast Eddie (Sirius Software  1982)  was  made  possible  by Hack-O-Matic 3.

The Woolies are at it again stealing Bubsy's  stuff  and  this  time  they  stole  EVERYTHING and stored it on the planet Kaboodle!  Bubsy  will  need  to  JUMP OVER the Woolies to get it all back. In the game  you'll  see  objects  Bubsy needs to collect on based on items he collected in:

- Bubsy: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind.
- Bubsy 2 http://store.steampowered.com/ app/426630/Bubsy\_TwoFur/
- Bubsy Fractured Furry Tales
- Bubsy 3D
- Bubsy 3D: Bubsy Visits the James Turrell Respective

And even the newest which came out recently that I'm enjoying:

mations for that worked a bit differently than they did the 2600/5200/800 versions. I wasn't happy with it for a bit, but then I read this from a Vic 20 gamer:

## From TheTick1:

"I  played  Fast  Eddie  on  my  Vic20 back in the early 80's. I may have to mess with the built-in ML monitor on VICE and work on a similar Bubsy  for my  good  'ole Vic20. Would  be  awesome  to  see  Bubsy running  on  my  early  80's  Vic20 hardware."

Figured that was enough reason to get something going for people to try out. After ongoing development on this for two days and input from some folks on Atariage  about  how  the  Vic  20  colors work, I liked how the animations, color, and feel of the game has turned out.

## Categorizing Amiga Users

Welcome  to  the  new  year.  Only  time will tell if this year will be as crazy as

## Dallas

the last year or so. It's only barely started  and  it's  already  tried  to  kill  us  a couple  times  with  frigid  weather,  so it's not the best of starts so far.

In the news, the magazine 'Amiga Future'  celebrates  twenty  years  of  existence this month. This is pretty special in my opinion, mainly because I'm not aware  of  any  Amiga-centric  publications that lasted that long, aside from slightly less 'official' publications like the AmiTech Gazette. Hardly any Amiga mags (or many mags in general) last from 1985 to 2005, or whatever corresponds  to  'x+20'  from  whatever  the year of first publication was. This newsletter has that beat of course, but that's not that difficult at only a couple pages each month.

This  month's  meeting  is  our  usual, January 20th at the Kettering-Moraine library  study  room.  I'm  planning  to bring my Vampire'd-up Amiga 600 to the meeting, with a bit more to show than previous months. I've been meaning  to  be  further  along  building  the system  and  software,  but    it's  not  as easy to find the time as I wish it were. Still, I'll be there, and so will the system. Hope to see you there as well.

In the past, I've written about the various types of Amiga enthusiasts, divided  into  a  few  basic  categories.  The available technologies in the field have changed since my last visit to the subject, shifting the balance somewhat, if not the categories themselves. On one end  of  the  spectrum  lie  the  'retro' types, whose main goal is to run classic Amiga software, primarily games. This group has the greatest number of 'casual'  Amiga  fans,  and  people  who might've had no direct experience with Amiga  systems  when  they  were  new, and are in it for the retro gaming experience.

Some may do this through emulation on  their  home  computers,  Raspberry Pi or other small systems, or even sufficiently powerful game consoles. Some may  take  the  route  of  the  FPGA  'remake' systems like MiniMig and others. Still  others  are  purists  about  it,  and might  only  accept  real  discs  on  real hardware  (probably  an  A500,  maybe the A600, A1200, or CD-32), preferably attached to a real CRT monitor. Whether the hardware is real or virtual, it is usually modest, as most Amiga games rarely made use of anything beyond a baseline  system  (as  opposed  to  modern  PC  gaming,  where  the  opposite tends to be true).

The next step up are the 'Power Classic' people. This group has expanded quite a bit recently thanks to an expansion of available options. In the old days, these were the Amiga users who had the big box  systems,  and/or  spent  the  big bucks expanding them with RAM, storage, accelerators, new video cards, and more. Their goal is to maintain compatibility with a wide range of Amiga software, from entertainment to productivity  to  the  stuff  that  needs  a heavy-duty machine just to run. If they run  classic  games,  it's  probably  done off the hard drive with the aid of software like WHDLoad, alongside ports of Doom or Quake.

Some in this category are happy with classic  Amiga  hardware  with  classic expansions, though that is considered the low end by today's standards. Others  take  the  emulation  route,  as  the average PC or even the humble Raspberry Pi is capable of running the Amiga  system  at  beefed-up  specs.  The biggest bump to interest in this power class  has  been  the  Vampire  FPGAbased hardware expansions from Apollo, which bump 'small' Amigas like the A500 or A600 well  beyond the power and speed of previously available A4000s with 68060 accelerators for a moderate  price,  with  newer  versions for  the  A1200  and  a  stand-alone  version that requires no legacy hardware on  the  way.  The  Vampire  hardware family has been the best fulfillment of previous promises to create a system beyond the spec of the classic Amigas, while maintaining a high level of past compatibility, at least for the time be- ing, and has become very popular in a short time.

Next up are the 'Modern Amiga' enthusiasts,  those  who  hoped  to  bring  the Amiga experience into the modern day and keep up with the likes of the Windows PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes, if not entirely  successfully.  These  were  the people that adopted one of the 'successor' operating systems like OS4 or MorphOS, which run on PowerPC CPU-based hardware, such as the Aeon OS4  systems  or  the  PPC  Macs  abandoned by Apple for Morph. The 'Amithlon' partial emulation suite did much the same on PC hardware. While there is  a  good  deal  of  compatibility  with well-behaved classic Amiga productivity  and  other  software,  anything  that depends  on  actual  Amiga  hardware and 'bangs the metal' will not work at all, unless it's done inside an emulator. Still,  that  classic  software  can  run  at speeds  far  beyond  what  it  would  on original  hardware,  and  new  software directly  written  to  the  new  OS  and hardware is faster still.

Sadly,  maintaining  classic  compatibility  imposes limits to the potential system  specs,  at  least  the  way  it  is  now. Also, the PowerPC line of hardware is more and more of a dead end as Intel and  ARM-based  stuff  moves  further along.  Switching  to  something  new breaks  classic  compatibility  too,  leaving  the  users  in  this  category  with  a dilemma as they try to move forward themselves.  Do  they  push  for  classic compatibility  and  live  with  the  possible performance penalties that imposes,  or  do  they  cast  off  the  past  like  a gangrenous  foot,  and  shoot  for  the moon?  Considering  new  software  development,  especially  for  high  profile software and applications hasn't exactly  taken  off  for  OS4  or  MorphOS, this isn't  exactly  a  simple  answer,  and  divides people as much as the divide between MorphOS and Amiga OS4, Still…

The  final  category  is  the  'no  limits' group, those who advocate taking the Amiga experience at least as far as any other  computer  system,  and  far  beyond  the  current  Amiga  experience. This category is closer to hypothetical than practical, with the basis of making a fully modern computer operating sys- tems around the positive points of the Amiga,  but  running  original  software or  hardware  is  not  a  requirement. (That  can  be  emulated  if  you  want). Examples include the open-source AROS project (which is actually a wideranging  project  with  fingers  in  every category in this article) and Amiga-inspired OS projects like BeOS or Haiku.

One of the constant issues here is that all software has to be written new for the  platform,  or  ported  across  from something  else.  People  in  this  group tend to be enthusiasts for a lot of different operating systems, comparing and contrasting  them.  Everyone  has  a  different view of where the 'line of 'Amiganess'  lies-where  something  stops being  sufficiently  Amiga.  Is  an  Amiga its hardware? Its software? Only some of that hardware or software? Is it the operating system? The name? Or is it just a set of ideas and philosophies for a  computing  experience?  You  could probably  get  a  slightly  different  answer  from  every  Amiga  fan  you  ask, and perhaps that's the best thing about it.  While  the  differences  of  opinions may  serve  to  spread  thin  the  limited resources and efforts of the community,  we're  spoiled  for  choice,  and  that just  makes  it  easier  (and  sometimes cheaper)  to  find  exactly  the  kind  of Amiga experience you want.

## The Wi-Fi Alliance Announces WPA3

The Wi-Fi Alliance, which certifies WiFi  products, has announced  WPA3, a major  upgrade  to  Wi-Fi  security  that will  appear  in  2018  and  take  care  of known flaws while simultaneously requiring less effort on your part. Among other things, it will eliminate the nasty KRACK vulnerability and secure open Wi-Fi networks. (See 'Wi-Fi Security

The Wi-Fi Alliance is a trade group that dates back nearly 20 years. It has long been  responsible  for  keeping  all  the cats  in  the  local  wireless  networking bag, preventing forks and proprietary standards that have  plagued  other technologies. Almost 15 years ago, the Wi-Fi Alliance worked to recover from the  terrible  flaws  in  its  original  network  encryption  standard,  WEP,  by getting the whole industry to switch to the far more secure WPA2.

WPA2 encrypts traffic passed over the Wi-Fi  wireless  local  area  network  to prevent  anyone  without  the  network pass-phrase  or  an    enterprise  login from being able to decipher the flow of data. On an  enterprise network, even devices  on  the  same  Wi-Fi  network can't  see  each  other's  data.  It's  supposed to work that way on passphraseonly Wi-Fi networks too, like what you have  in  your  home,  but  flaws  in  the protocol  allow  someone  with  the  network's shared password and a simple cracking tool to access data from other network users.

While the WPA2 standard was largely designed well, it hasn't changed in 15 years, which is a long time in the security world. Last year, a security researcher  discovered  a  major  flaw  that  he dubbed  KRACK.  It  could  allow  someone in proximity to a Wi-Fi network to recover certain kinds of otherwise protected  data.  Major  vendors,  including Apple, released patches for Wi-Fi adapters  and  routers,  but  older  hardware  that  is  un-patched  or  un-patchable remains vulnerable, and the repairs were more bandages than curative surgery.

The new WPA3 fixes the fundamental flaw related to KRACK by replacing the four-way handshake between a Wi-Fi device and a base  station that turned out to be vulnerable. Precise details of

WPA3's  redesigned  method  of  establishing a secure connection aren't yet available.

The new WPA3 standard also adds the following:

- Even when a user picks a weak pass-phrase-like  pass1234WPA3 will process it without user involvement so that the password can't be extracted via brute-force attacks  that  rely  on  iterating through short, common, and dictionary-based passwords.
- WPA3 provides better security for devices with limited input methods, like printers, to join a network  securely.  That  was supposed to be the job of WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), but it never reached its potential, and the WPS spec has security flaws.
- Encryption key length in WPA3 rises from 128 bits to 192 bits to meet  a  level  of  protection  required for U.S. government use.
- Joining a password-free network will now securely set up an encrypted connection.
- All connections will now be protected from other users of the same network, something that's reliably available only with enterprise connections today.

These last  two  points  are  a  major  improvement for public Wi-Fi networks. Unsecured  networks  are  convenient because  businesses  and    institutions don't  have  to  provide  a  Wi-Fi  password to everyone who  walks in. However, eliminating the need for a password also means  that users send their traffic across unprotected connections  that  can  be  intercepted  by  any-

one nearby with a Wi-Fi sniffer. With WPA3, Wi-Fi  providers  won't  have  to choose between convenience and security.

The Wi-Fi Alliance also said it's upping its game with WPA2, adding more tests of how WPA2 is implemented by companies  to  provide  better  consistency and security.

WPA3 will start appearing in hardware in  2018,  but  WPA2  will  remain  available  for  compatible  devices  for  some time to come-almost certainly for several years, given its installed base. Unfortunately, most devices that  run WPA2 likely can't be updated to WPA3, possibly apart from some more recent devices  that  were  designed  with  an idea of what hardware features WPA3 would require.

That means that WPA2 will remain the weakest  link  in  Wi-Fi  security  until WPA3 is supported by every device you use and all the base stations to which you connect. As we saw with the transition  from  WEP  to  WPA2,  which  involved the interim WPA standard, that can be a long process.
