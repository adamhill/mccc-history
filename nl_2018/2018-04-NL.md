## Raspberry Pi and the Amiga

Since its debut in February 2012 the Raspberry  Pi  has  become  the  very symbol of a little machine that can do anything.  So  far  it  has  proven  to  be capable of doing just about anything, one can dream up for this little computer. My attraction to the Raspberry Pi  would be in its  ability  to  emulate the Amiga computer as well as many classic game consoles. Watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v =6HZXM6cLVUg

as I did, and I'm sure you will see its potential as an Amiga.

For about $60 the preferable Raspberry  Pi  3  can  be  purchased  giving  you the main components to get started. I already  had  a  USB  mouse  and  keyboard and an HDMI cable needed to connect to my monitor. I also owned Amiga Forever, the emulator package needed mainly for the Kickstart ROMs to get the Amiga part started. Getting the Raspberry Pi started involved putting it together, a tool-free job as the case  simply  snaps  together  around the motherboard.

Now to get the Raspberry Pi running. I  checked  out  several  setups  for  getting the it running, but one stood out. Amibian  is  a  very  lightweight  Linux setup  that  makes  the  Amiga  setup quick and easy. Go to this site:

It  has  everything  on  this  one  page website  to  get  you  going,  including the software needed to write the image-file  to  the  microSD  card.  That brought  up  another  thing  needed:  a card adapter that plugs into the USB

of my PC to write the image-file on the microSD. The image-file contains the LinuxOS and the Amiga Emulator software that make the magic take place.

The first boot-up of the Amibian definitely  shows  how  fast  things  are  going  to  be.  It  is  up  and  ready  very quickly.  Follow  the  instructions  on the  Amibian  website,  for  getting  the microSD final prep completed.

Some years ago I had decided to give Amiga Forever a try on a PC and I was blown away as to how fast it was. As a result I  already had all of my Amiga files  setup  and  ready  to  use,  which saved time for this adventure. Setting up the files involved not much more than creating directories for the content  of  a  drive  or  partition.  I  could then copy the directory into a directory on the microSD set up by Amibian. A directory is also set up for ADF files which  are  for  Amiga  floppy  disks turned into files that can be read like a floppy in a disk drive. I put files on a thumb drive and plugged it into one of  the  four  USB  connectors  on  the Raspberry Pi. Now the tough part.

Amibian has a rather simplified interface called Midnight Commander that allows you to copy the files needed to the  correct  places  on  the  microSD card. The hard part is that it uses the keyboard for everything. I reached for the mouse so many times while trying to  copy files  over,  that  it  became  annoying. Once you get the hang of it, it isn't bad. The second hard part of this is finding the proper directory to copy to. You will be copying Kickstart ROM files, the hard disk files, and/or floppy disk  files.  If  you  wish  to  start  from scratch  you  can  put  the  five  floppy disk  files-matching  the  five  disk  of Workbench 3.1 for instance-then cre-

ate an empty directory in the hard-file directory named whatever you want it  to  be.  If  your  goal  is  to  setup  3.9, then you will need the 3.9 CD to update the setup. When using the floppy drive emulation, they have even duplicated the speed of the floppy drives, or at least it seemed. With the adjustment of a slider you can increase the speed to eight times faster. That really helped. Using modern replacements for the floppy, has spoiled me.

Setting up the emulator will be made easier  if  you  ave  knowledge  of  the Amiga and how it works. Example: do you want to create an Amiga 500 in its basic  form  or  a  4000  in  full-blown setup?  You  get  to  make  the  choices. You  may  want  to  play  some  Amiga game from the early days of the Amiga. Keeping the setup simple for that definitely  has  advantages.  The  great thing about the emulator is that you can  setup  all  kinds  of  Amigas  and have them ready to run in a moment's notice.  In  the  setup  page,  which  is where you end up when you boot the Raspberry  Pi  ,  you  choose  the  ROM file,  what to boot from, what chipset to  use,  what  CPU,  how  many  floppy drives,  and  so  many  more  things  to choose. Only a few need to be chosen. I set up a duplicate of my last Amigait worked!

My  last  Amiga  ran  a  60MHz  68060. This emulation doesn't offer a 68060, but  does  offer  a  68040  running  at very fast speed. Roughly six times faster  than  my  68060  could  do!  Everything I tried was incredibly fast, and looked much better due to the HDMI hookup  to  a  much  better  monitor than  I  ever  had  on  my  Amiga.  You save  the  settings  and  they  are  there ready for the next time, instantly. You can  even  set  it  up  to  start  up  as  an

Amiga, and not go through the emulation setup interface.

As you can tell it is very fast, but the numbers  will  show  you  that  emulation does lose some of the potential of the  Raspberry Pi. It  has  a  1.2  GHz  4 Core processor, but until a change is made somehow, the emulated Amiga is only using one core, and because of all  of  the  work  the  CPU  is  doing  to make  the  emulation  work  it  is  only showing six times the speed, instead of twenty times the speed difference might get, dividing 60MHz into 1200MHz. It has been suggested that a smart move for the AmigaOS would be to recompile it to work in the Raspberry Pi. There were 4.5 million Raspberry Pis sold before version 3 came out, and it appears to now be selling even faster. Using more than one core is a problem that is affecting the AmigaONE owners as well. The AmigaONE X1000 and X5000/20 have dual core processors, and the X5000/40 has a quad core. With AmigaOS 4.1 they are only able to use one of the cores. AmigaOS 4.2 is supposed to offer limited multiple  core  usage.  Limited  means what? I do not know. Still it is a tribute  to  the  AmigaOS  watching  the Raspberry  Pi  run  AmigaOS,  and  the AmigaONE running 4.1, and doing everything  very fast!

The Amiga emulation on the Raspberry Pi has become so popular that cases that look like little Amiga computers  have  sprung  up  all  over the  Internet.  My  favorite  was  a  full sized 3000 case for Raspberry Pi.

There are also some add-ons for the computer, to add functions to the emulation.  One  recent  is  a  FPGA  chip card.  The  FPGA  has  been  making news in the Amiga world by being the driving force on the Vampire accelerator card. It offers Amiga users a new level of performance never dreamed of  for  original  Amigas.  They  have even begun calling it the 68080. Which  is  faster  has  come  up.  At  the moment  the  Raspberry  Pi  seems  to hold  a  speed  advantage,  but  just  a little.  Every  time  the  Vampire  dips into the older hardware it loses speed, but it is getting to the point where it does it so less and less. But the Raspberry Pi truly wins on price. The Vampire  is  just  an  Amiga  accelerator  for $300. The Raspberry Pi is a complete computer for around $60.

There is now a FPGA card announced for  the  Raspberry  Pi,  if  it  offers  anything for the Amiga emulation, it has yet to be seen. The AmigaONE X1000 and  X5000  have  FPGA  chips  on  the motherboard, but those have yet to be put to use as well.

A recent announcement for the Raspberry  Pi  is  a  full  blown  laptop  case and parts, that could give the world a low  priced  Amiga  laptop.  It  is  very compact.  The  Raspberry  Pi  dimensions  keep  the  laptop  from  being  as thin  as  some  very  popular  laptops, but it is portable.

As I was in the process of putting this article  together,  the  Raspberry  Pi  3 B+  made  it's  debut.  Offering  greater CPU  speed  will  give  a  boost  to  the Amiga emulation, as well as faster networking  with  the  1  gigabit,  and  improved bluetooth speed, with version 4.2. The amazing part: it is only a few dollars  more  than  the  previous  version.

Well, in closing, if I can say anything, the Raspberry Pi is quite an achievement and can provide many avenues to help take advantage of its abilities. It would take a big list to show even half of the things it can do. It can emulate  fifty  different  game  consoles.  If you want a pocket sized Amiga, it can do it,  as  well  as  many other computers. The Raspberry Pi can and is putting the fun back in computers.

## Speed Comparisons and Amiga Nostalgia

March has arrived, and I'm not sure whether we've gotten the lion or the lamb  at  this  point.  There  are  a  few notable  developments,  one  of  which ties in to my continuing adventures of the Vampire A600. The Apollo Accelerators team recently put out the public  release  of  the  'Gold  2.7'  core  for the Vampire 500 and 600 cards. This adds several enhancements over the previous public release, but the headliner  is  the  addition  of  the  FPU  (the Floating  Point  Unit  for  the  uninitiated- for complex math stuff such as 3D work).

I  downloaded  the  new  core  for  my Vampire  600,  followed  the  installation  instructions  to  the  letter,  and turned  my  Amiga  600  into  a  brick. Apparently  the  update  did  not  go through properly, and I was unable to try a second time now that the system refused to do anything. My next step was to  order  a  'USB  Blaster'  device, which allows you to program the FPGA core on the Vampire board from an  external  computer.  Eight  dollars and four days later, I had the device and  the  software  I  needed,  but  my attempts to program it from my Linux laptop were unsuccessful. I took the next  option  available-bringing  the Amiga  and  'blaster'  to  VP  Mike  Barclay's  home,  and  trying  to  program the core from his Windows machine. Thankfully, the operation was mostly a success, and the A600 is back up and running  with  the  new  core.  I'm  not completely  out  of  the  woods  yet,  as the  SAGA  graphics  from  the  Vampire's  HDMI  port  are  not  coming through in  full  color,  but  everything else is apparently working fine, and I want to be sure to exhaust all other troubleshooting possibilities before I dare try re-flashing the core again.

At  the  last  meeting,  I  started  to  explore  some  'practical'  speed  trials and comparisons of the Vampire system.  I  got  my  copy  of  Lightwave  3D (V5) running, with an identical scene of  a  spaceship  rending  an  800x600

pixel image on my different systems. My  venerable  A4000T/68060  rendered the scene in 8 minutes, 59 seconds. My MorphOS G5 Mac rendered the same scene with all the same settings  in  just  32  seconds.  (Doing  it  a second time clocked in at a quicker 30 seconds,  thanks  to  the  nature  of  JIT processor emulation.) The Morph G5 has an extra speed advantage in that it  does  not  perform  some  of  the  display  updates  that  require  an  Amiga chipset, but I doubt that would be that big a drag if it did. Finally, I set up the render  on  the  Vampire  A600  at  last month's meeting. Unfortunately, this was  under  the  previous  'GOLD  2' core with no FPU, which Lightwave 5 requires  to  run.  I  was  able  to  run  it thanks to 'Femu'-software that emulates an FPU-but like many forms of emulation, it was slow and quite a drag  to  the  system.  The  render  was only  about  halfway  finished  by  the time we had to cancel and finish the meeting.  Once  I  had  more  available time  at  home,  I  set  up  the  render again, which took a glacial four hours, 55  minutes,  and  49  seconds  to  complete.  Obviously  rendering  under  an emulated FPU is not recommended.

After  all  the  mess  updating  the  Vampire's core to version 2.7, (now with FPU), I ran the test again, and got a far more  respectable  render  time  of  6 minutes even. I also did a few other time trials using some of my commonly-used graphics software (as opposed to benchmarks or SysInfo like everyone tries at least once). Bear in mind these times are far from exact, as  my  reaction  time  and  fumbly  fingers  on  a  stopwatch  app  are  factors, but you should get an idea.

Lightwave 3d V5 spaceship render: (800x600, raytraced shadows, glow effects)

- Amiga 4000T/060 - 8 min 59 sec
- MorphOS Mac G5 - 32 sec
- V600 2.5 (emulated FPU) - 4 hr 55 min 49 sec
- V600 2.7 w/FPU - 6 min 0 sec

Personal Paint 7.1 load/convert JPEG (800x600 24 bit to 256 color)

- Amiga 4000T/060 - 8.2 sec.
- A600/V600 2.7 - 6.1 sec.
- MorphOS Mac G5 - 2.7 sec.

Image FX 4.5 Gaussian Blur (640x844 24 bit, blur over entire image)

- Amiga 4000T/060 - 15.7 sec.
- A600/V600 2.7 - 12.9 sec.
- MorphOS Mac G5 - 1.35 sec. (Note: The G5 was using PowerPC native code here, and thus had a huge advantage)

As you can see from these admittedly imprecise  tests,  the  Vampire  A600, while not touching the speeds of the G5 even when it runs 68K-based software, it offers a significant all-around speed  boost  over  the  previous  'fastest  ever'  68060/50  Mhz,  knocking down all times by about a fourth or more,  which  is  quite  good  for  something which is still ostensibly a 68000-series CPU.

One  of  the  things  I  enjoy  about  our modern world is that, surprising as it may  seem,  nostalgic  Amiga  material both new and old is easier to find than ever. For example, there's a wealth of Amiga stuff to be found on YouTube, with new things popping up fairly regularly, from old game coverage to talk of  the  new  Vampire-accelerated  systems and more. Here are a few videos I have found which you might enjoy, if you haven't already seen them all.
