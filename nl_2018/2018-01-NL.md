## Acer LCD Supports Amiga 15khz Output

Today I wanted to show an interesting LCD screen from Acer that is a current model, available brand  new  in  2017.  What  is  so special  about  it  you  ask?  Well,  it supports Amiga video modes that run  at  15khz!  So  with  a  RGB  to VGA converter you can get native Amiga  display  on  a  modern  LCD screen,  without  the  need  for  a scan doubler! Exciting right?

The model I got is a V226HQL model if you want to get one yourself. Even though I bought this new in its  original  box,  it  is  a  few  years old.  I  have  seen  others  on  Facebook  using  ones  made  in  early 2017 that work also.

Of  course,  the  Amiga  uses  a  nonstandard  23  pin  RGB  connector, intended  for  connection  to  Commodore  CRT  1084(S)  /  1940  or 1960  monitors.  These  take  up  a lot  of  room  and  the  non-flat  displays  are  very  small  in  this  day and  age.  To  connect  the  Acer screen  to  the  Amiga,  I  needed  a RGB to VGA converter. This is not a  scan-doubler-it  just  converts the  existing  15khz  signal  from RGB to VGA.

These are easy enough to come by on Ebay, but check carefully to get ones that have a REAL 23 pin connector, rather than a DIY hacked 25 pin connector on them. Generally sellers try to hide the fact they

hack the connectors to make them fit a standard Amiga RGB connection  since  23  pin  connectors  are not exactly easy to come by these days.  Check  the  photos  carefully and  read  the  seller  feedback.  I found a seller on Ebay who makes these converters (from Canada actually), using the right 23 pin RGB connector. I ordered 3 of them!

Here  is  the  converter  I  received last week:

Since I happened to have the Amiga 1200 out at the time, I decided to try it on that system first. Technically I don't need it since I have an  Indivision  AGA  installed  in  it already, but hey, why not check it anyway!  Here  it  is  connected  to the A1200.

On  power  on  I  held  down  both mouse  buttons  to  get  the  early boot  screen,  which  appeared  on

the  Acer  screen  straight  away!  I then brought up the screen mode info screen to confirm it is indeed running at 15khz! The screen does  promote  the  screen  to  a slightly odd 1440x288 screen mode,  but  it  looks  fine  and  the aspect seems ok too. I tried modifying  the  usual  fill  screen/aspect control  to  adjust  it  to  4:3,  but  it doesn't change the screen. So the resolution  is  what  it  is,  but  as  I said,  it  displays  fine  from  what  I could see.

I  then  decided  to  try  a  different Amiga. I hooked up the Amiga 600 next. As with the A1200, I already have a Indivision ECS installed in the A600, so technically it doesn't need  this  screen  either.    As  you can see, the output from the RGB port at 15khz to the Acer screen works fine on the A600 also:

Something to remember though is that because it is native 15khz output  that  is  not  scan  doubled  or flicker fixed, any interlace modes will flicker the screen, the same as all Amigas do on the 1084S monitor or TV output.

Running  Bomb's  E255  demo  on the A600 looked great on the Acer screen.

As a test I removed the converter from the RGB port so there was no display.  I  then  booted  from  the kickstart  disk  and  the  machine was clicking the drives so I knew it  was  at  the  Workbench  boot screen.  I  connected  the  RGB  to VGA  converter  at  this  point  and the display appeared and worked perfectly!

Next up I hooked up the Amiga

1000, one of the systems I wanted to get this screen for. Unlike the

other Amigas I don't have a Indivi- sion ECS installed or a scan-dou-

bler connected to it. It needs this screen, and so I was very excited

Next  up  I  hooked  up  the  Amiga 1000, one of the systems I wanted to  get  this  screen  for.  Unlike  the other Amigas I don't have a Indivision  ECS  installed  or  a  scan-doubler connected to it. It needs this screen, and so I was very excited to  try  it  out.  As  you  can  see  the Kickstart screen came up fine on the Acer.

I  did  hit  some  trouble  here  with the Amiga 1000 though. For some reason  when  I  booted  any  kickstart disk, the system wouldn't display  the  Insert  Workbench  disk screen  and  instead  hung  on  a black screen. The screen was displaying something, but the system wasn't responsive.

from the RGB port to this new Acer  screen  since  it  can  accept  the 15khz  output.  As  expected,  once powered on it worked great.

I fired up the rather excellent Rink A  Pink  demo,  booting  via  floppy and  it  worked  great  on  the  Acer too.

There is a useful wiki that lists all the 15khz compatible models that people  have  tried  out,  which  includes the one I covered here today. You can read it here: http://15khz.wikidot.com/

It is great that we have options in 2017 to output our ~30 year old Amiga systems to modern screens, still supporting the 15khz output required!  If  I  had  more  room  I

Strange  behavior  though.  It  only seems  to  happen  on  the  Amiga 1000. I tried 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 kickstarts  and  also  all  three  converters  I  bought  and  they  all  do the same thing. Having plugged in the  RGB  to  VGA  converter  after the Insert Workbench disk screen appeared, it did work perfectly on the A1000 though. Strange huh? I guess  the  16khz  is  what  causes the problems but really don't understand that one. If anyone knows  what  is  happening  here please let me know.

Last, but not least, I connected my CDTV  to  the  Acer  screen.  It  also doesn't have a Indivision ECS scandoubler installed, and until now I used the AV out to connect it to a TV,  or  my  HDMI  upscaler  to  convert  the  signal  to  display  on  my HDMI LCD screens. Now though, I can  connect  the  CDTV  directly would buy more screens now that I  know they work, but things are tight  in  here  these  days  space wise. I might get one more though as a backup.

## The Vampire Arrives

In  the  amazing  saga  of  Vampire Quest®,  after  what  feels  like  decades of waiting and runaround, I finally  have  my  Vampire  600  V2 board.  Actually  I  received  it  last month,  but  I  withheld  that  information in the November newsletter for the  sake  of  it  being  a surprise at the meeting. While it's tempting  to  do  so,  I  have  not rushed  to  get  it  running,  for  the sake  of  making  sure  the  I's  are dotted  and  T's  are  crossed,  and avoiding  mistakes  made  in  excited haste. Because of this I haven't really  experienced  much  of  the power of the Vampire yet, though I am learning things as I go.

Firstly, there is very little real estate  inside  the  case  of  an  Amiga 600,  and  it's  quite  the  challenge getting  the  Vampire  card  and  a RapidRoad USB interface crammed inside there with their supporting  cables  in  such  a  way that the case will close.

Secondly,  while  it's  apparent  the Vampire  card  attaches  over  the surface-mounted  68000  CPU  on the  motherboard, I didn't  realize exactly  the  effort  that  takes.  Initially I had the board snugged up against the CPU (aided by the included screws), but the board did not appear to be working correctly,  despite  apparently  powering on.  I  learned  that  I  didn't  do  a good  enough  job  attaching  the board, which involved literally CRAMMING  the  Vampire  socket onto  the  CPU  (not  for  the  squeamish)  until  it  is  flush  with  the motherboard.  The  screws  seem less necessary once you see how tightly the board fits on, but their job  is  to  keep  the  board  from working loose once it's there.

Thirdly,  it's  interesting  to  note that  the  kickstart  ROM  on  the motherboard becomes  optional once the Vampire is installed, as it has  its  own  custom  version  of Kickstart  internally  (required  to accommodate its function, though I'm not sure if this copies the Commodore  code  or  uses  an  AROSbased open equivalent.) The board  appeared  to  be  working more correctly now, but apparent conflicts with the RapidRoad USB adapter  caused  errors  with  the Compact Flash card that serves as the hard drive. I jumped though a few hoops trying to figure out the problem,  but  it  would  seem  that

re-installing the 3.1 operating system  from  floppies  has  fixed  the issue. (Late update: perhaps not.)

The  story  leaves  off  here  for  the moment, though I hope to be a bit further along on the software side by the time of the meeting. As my long  VampireQuest®  comes  to  a close, originally begun in March of 2016 when I first wrote in declaring my intent to buy one, up to last month with the receipt of the actual  board.  There  are  undoubtedly plenty of stories yet to come, as I see  there's  still  plenty  of  fight ahead of me to turn this tiny monster 600 into a useful productive Amiga, but the achievement of getting  the  board  itself  has  been reached. Stay Tuned in the future however for Vampire-Quest II, the search for the Vampire V4 standalone Amiga-alike system, coming to a newsletter near you in 2018 (maybe).
