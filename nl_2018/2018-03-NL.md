## Life Left in Classic Amigas

With  things  like  the  Vampire  and other  affordable  accelerator  cards for  low-end  systems  being  more readily  available,  interest  appears to  be  rising  in  the  low-to-middle end  of  Amiga  retro  usage  lately. Nowadays  there  are  a  handful  of issues when it comes to using older hardware, generally related to trying to use it in concert with newer hardware  and  standards.  A  common issue is that of video, as Amigas, especially older ones, use NTSC and PAL (15 kHz) video scan rates, which has been more and more of a problem  as  31  kHz  VGA  became dominant  for  computer  monitors, then  LCD  and  HD  wide  screens, along  with  digital  signal  cabling like the DVI and HDMI interfaces.

The Vampire card has an HDMI interface,  and  an  'SAGA  video  card' built in to allow you to output to HD screens much like an Amiga with a dedicated  video  card.  Future  core updates  of  the  Vampire  intend  to implement  the  Amiga  AGA  chip hardware, thus making it possible to  output  common  Amiga  resolutions  and  (hopefully)  'metal-banging' games and software via HDMI.

Unfortunately, for the moment, Amiga  chipset  video  still  goes  out through the standard ports, requiring anything from a switch to a separate monitor if you want to work both  sides,  and  you're  still  stuck finding  a  method  for  viewing  15 kHz video. Many in the 'retro' com-

puting and gaming world  keep around at least one dedicated CRT 15 kHz monitor, such as the venerable  Commodore  1084.  If  you  do some research, you can find a few recent  LCD  monitors  that  will  accept 15 kHz video signals, as long as you have a good VGA cable adapter for the Amiga's 23 pin video port. Another option is a scan-doubler or HD up-converter (internal or external) to modify the native signal into one  for  a  modern  TV  or  monitor. (again, you may require an Amiga to VGA cable, or SCART, or component)  These  up-converters  range from inexpensive with quality that depends  heavily  on  what  you  are willing  to  accept  (like  unimpressive  picture  quality  or  significant video lag), to high quality and fast response with a price tag to match.

Sometimes waiting around for the Vampire cores to catch up on Amiga chip implementation looks like the best  option,  but  that  doesn't  help those  using  something  else,  or  no enhanced hardware at all.

The other main issue is that of getting  files  in  and  out  the  system from your other computers or outside sources. Back in the day, floppy  discs  were  the  only  universal standard for moving files in and out of the Amiga, which didn't seem too bad  then  since  most  of  the  files were under a megabyte. Now with giga/terabytes  of  storage  in  the palm of your hand, networks, wireless,  and  Internet  on  everything, the  old  Amigas  look  like  xenophobic isolationists by comparison. Thankfully, there are multiple new-

er  methods  for  getting  things  in and  out  of  your  Amiga  systems, again  depending  on  how  much work and money you want to put into it.

A common option for the retro gaming crowd is the Gotek drive, replacing  or  supplanting  an  unreliable floppy  drive  with  one  which  accepts SD  cards or  flash  thumbdrives loaded with ADF disk image files.  This  is  a  limited  option  designed mostly for replacing floppy discs, and thus has a fairly specific use  geared  toward  classic  gaming. One of the most versatile options is adding a USB adapter, as not only does this give access to flash drives and other storage, you can also add PC  mice,  keyboards,  and  a  wide range of other USB hardware. For small-box  Amigas  like  the  A500, A600,  and  A1200,  this  is  usually accomplished  by  boards  like  the Subway  or  RapidRoad,  which  use the clock port interface  on  the A1200  motherboard,  or  on  thirdparty memory/clock cards for the 600 and 500. This is one of the pricier solutions, no to mention a challenge  trying  to  fit  the  card  and cabling inside a cramped all-in-one Amiga case.

Another  option  is  a  network  card, either  wired  or  wireless.  This  has obvious  benefits,  but  if  your  only goal was to get files in and out, it's a  bit  indirect,  requiring  you  to  access  files  on  another  computer  or device,  or  even  doing  thing  like  emailing attachments to yourself. Amiga  network  hardware  can  be pricey,  with  some  of  the  cheaper options being re-purposed PCMCIA network cards for the interface on the A600 or A1200. One of the less pricey options for large file transfer, at  least  for  600s  and  1200s,  is  a PCMCIA adapter for memory cards such  as  Compact  Flash.  Like  any PCMCIA card to be used on an Amiga, you need a 16 bit card to match the  stock  Amiga  interface.  Amiga Kit sells one for roughly $13. If you find it  difficult  or  pricey  to  get  CF memory  cards,  further  adapters are  available  to  use  common  and inexpensive SD cards in their place. These adapters cost about $12 each. Mine is a brand called Digigear, and was  bought  through  Amazon.com. (You want the slim version for one that works with Amiga PCMCIA or IDE drive adapters.) They seem to work quite well, though it is recommended to avoid card sizes above 32 gigabytes.

For  a  while  it  seemed  like  classic Amiga  was  stagnating  somewhat, with  more  attention  going  to  the 'high end' systems that ran OS4 or MorphOS. The door seems to have swung  the  other  way  in  the  last couple  of  years,  thanks  to  more available and affordable hardware options to make the classic systems 'just modern enough' to work within the framework of modern monitors  or  storage  technologies.  It's plenty  enjoyable  to  play  around with  classic  Amiga  hardware,  not unlike fixing up and tooling around in a classic car.

## Drones  Deliver Blood in Africa

Last  month  in  Rwanda,  a  young woman  started  bleeding  after  giving birth by C-section. Try as they might, her doctors couldn't stop it. They'd already transfused the two units  of  matching  blood  that  they had on-hand. They could have called  the  national  blood  bank  in the capital of Kigali to request more, but ordering it, and sending it the 25  miles  over  mountainous  roads to  the  hospital  would  take  up  to four hours. The woman didn't have that kind of time.

Desperate, the doctors called a distribution center near Kigali, where clinic  workers  and  a  flight  crew loaded a series of small, unmanned aircraft  with  the  needed  supplies and  launched  them  into  the  sky. Within 45 minutes, they dispatched seven units of red blood cells, four units  of  plasma,  and  two  units  of platelets, more than circulates through the entire human body.

Each drone needed just 15 minutes to reach the hospital, where  it dropped its payload on a pre-determined landing zone. Doctors grabbed the supplies and  used them  to  stabilize  the  24-year-old patient.

Delivering  medical  deliveries  by drone  has  become  almost  routine in Rwanda  since the California startup  Zipline  arrived  in  October. "We do this every day," says company founder and CEO Keller Rinaudo. Although  his  company's  hardware helped  save  that  woman's  life,  he gives all the credit to the team, recruited from the surrounding community,  at  the  distribution  center. 'That's  not  just  her  life,"  he  says, "that's a kid who has a mom.'

Now, Zipline is expanding into neighboring Tanzania, establishing the world's largest national drone delivery service.  The  Tanzanian government wants to make as many as 2,000 daily deliveries from four distribution centers serving an area roughly the size of Texas and Louisiana.

Zipline has performed about 1,400 deliveries in Rwanda, about a quarter  of  them  in  emergencies.  Its drones have clocked 60,000 , delivering  blood  to  areas  ground  vehicles  can't  reach  quickly,  or  at  all during the rainy season that turns roads to mud.

For the new service, Zipline plans to fly upgraded  versions of its fixed-wing  drones,  which  have  a 6-foot wingspan and can cruise at 70 mph. Each can carry 3 pounds of cargo  (one  unit  of  blood  weighs roughly 1.2 pounds), and the batteries  can  make  a  round  trip  of  100 miles. Folded wax paper parachutes  and  cardboard  cargo  bays make the drones both durable and cheap to operate and repair. 'The new  vehicle is highly modular," says Rinaudo. "If a sensor is giving weird  readings,  it's  super  fast  to replace that."

Tanzania's first distribution center is  slated  for  Dodoma,  the  capital, and will be up and running early in 2018. Three more will follow initially, with an eventual plan to create a network  to  serve  the  nation's  55 million  citizens.  That's  a  huge  expansion over the operation in Rwanda,  a  much  smaller  country, where the  drones  currently  reach around half of the population of 12 million. Each center will run a fleet of 30 drones, enough for 500 deliveries  daily.  In  addition  to  blood, they'll  carry  emergency  vaccines, HIV medications, and supplies like IV tubes, to 5,640 public health facilities.

Zipline makes a habit of recruiting and training local engineers, health workers,  and  flight  operators.  As was  the  case  in  Rwanda,  Rinaudo knows his team will have to work with  local  communities  to  emphasize  the  aircraft  perform  humanitarian, not military or surveillance, work.

The  drones  will  supplement  the government's sporadic overland deliveries.  'That  mission  can  be  a challenge during emergencies, times  of  unexpected  demand,  bad weather,  or  for  small  but  critical orders,'  Laurean  Bwanakunu,  director general of the country's medical  stores  department,  said  in  a statement.  'Using  drones  for  justin-time  deliveries  will  allow  us  to provide  health  facilities  with  complete  access  to  vital  medical  products no matter the circumstance.'

While Zipline might expand further in  Africa,  Rinaudo  believes  its  services could be useful globally. 'Rural healthcare is a huge problem in the US too,' he says.

But launching in America requires wrangling  with  restrictive  regulations that have limited drone deliveries  to  the  occasional  test,  like 7-Eleven's Slurpee shipment in Reno, Nevada, or Flirtey's drug dropoff in Virginia. Widespread operation requires approval from the FAA, which worries about keeping drones away from conventional aircraft.

But  remote  areas  of  the  countryrural Native American reservations, for  example-far  from  hospitals, could  certainly  benefit  from  a  Zipline-like  service.  And  from  there, it's not such a big leap to launching a  service  to  get  you  that  Amazon package you so desperately need.

## It's Not You, It's Your Android

Dating  can  be  stressful.  Going  out with  someone  whom  you  barely know has the potential to be a supremely  awkward  event,  whether because  of  their  awkwardness  or your own. Not to mention, putting yourself out there to be scrutinized by  others  can  feel  unpleasant,  because  who  knows  what  they  are thinking to themselves as you progress through the date.

Well, the information in this article won't  make  you  feel  any  better about all that!

Dating site Match.com performs an annual  Singles  in  America  Study, and  it  just  published  the  results from its eighth incarnation, which took input from over 5,000 single people. This year's study focused a lot  on  technology,  and  how  tech plays a role in the dating world.

One of the more interesting results from the study is that iPhone users are  21  times  more  likely  to  negatively judge Android users they end up  with  on  a  date.  Comparatively, Android  users  are  15  times  more likely to do the same to iPhone users,  so  that  settles  the  debate  on which subculture is more judgmental towards the other.

To be fair, even having your phone out on a date is cause for judgment, as  58%  of  respondents  claimed they don't want their date to have their phone face up on the table as they  chat.  75%  responded  they wouldn't want their date to answer the phone without any explanation, and 66% said "No" to their date texting.

Remarkably,  a  whopping  92%  of women were more likely to judge their date for having an older model of phone. So, to you single guys out there, might we recommend an upgrade?

Oh, and one more thing: the survey says  that  25%  of  people  would have sex with a robot,  but  almost half  of  the  respondents  said  they would  consider  it  cheating.  So  if you plan on having some hot robot sex, let your date know beforehand. Let us know how that goes for you.
