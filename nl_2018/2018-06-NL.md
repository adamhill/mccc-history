## A  Look  Back  at Game Hardware

It may have taken some time, but it seems like the weather has finally made up its mind about whether to give up on the cold or not, and leapt into summertime instead.

Our meeting takes place at the usual time and date, back in the usual 'group  study'  room.  I  will  bring back the Vampire-fied Amiga 600. I managed  to  find  my  way  around the  problem  I  was  having  at  the meeting last  month,  where  games loaded via WHDload used a key to cancel  to  Workbench  which  was not  available  on  the  short-form A600 keyboard. I'll go into how that issue was fixed at the meeting. I'll also show off classic Amiga DOOMclone  GLOOM, (actually Gloom Deluxe) which runs nicely on the Vampire.

As I gain more experience with the system,  I've  learned  to  moderate my  hype  a  bit.  The  Vampire  definitely runs significantly faster than a 68060 or slower system, but it's still  a  bit  much  to  expect  silkysmooth high-res 3D gaming that a PPC or Intel system might give you. I might get better performance out of the faster core versions, but with my past experience, I'm playing it safe for now.

Digressing a bit, I've been thinking about gaming history, and how consoles  and  computers  evolve  beyond their  abilities  in  one  way  or another. Many are familiar with the

first successful cartridge-based game  console, and the Amiga's grand-ancestor: the Atari 2600 VCS. When the hardware was being designed, it was made to recreate early-to-mid-1970s  arcade  games  at home,  from  Atari  and  others,  like the  many  variations  of  Pong,  or Tank (AKA Combat), usually simple two-player events with few moving objects. Also, ROM game cartridge sizes were limited to 4K for all program, graphics, and sound data, or 4096 text characters, or one multipart Trump tweet. This all appears very  limited  now,  but  it  could  do lots, and was more versatile than it first  appeared.  Bear  in  mind  that the system was released at least a year before Space Invaders first appeared in arcades.

Similar to the Atari in many ways was  the  next  big  game  system  of the  following  generation,  the  Nintendo  Entertainment  System,  or NES.  The  NES  didn't  come  to  our shores until 1985/6 for a number of  reasons  (about  the  same  time the first  Amiga  1000s  were  released), but before that it was the Nintendo  Famicom  (Family  Computer)  in  Japan,  released  in  1983 while the video game market was caving  in  on  itself  in  the  US.  Not unlike the Atari, the Famicom was designed  around  playing  an  excellent home version of arcade games of that time, specifically Nintendo's own  Donkey  Kong,  among  others. The Famicom and NES had its own set of limitations. I found it interesting to discover that the original Super  Mario  Bros  game  that  came with many of the first western NES

systems  was  actually  a  game  that was  made  to  push  the  limits  of  a stock system and ROM cartridge, a swan-song for what Nintendo thought to be a console on its last legs  in  Japan,  even  as  it  was  just starting in the USA and elsewhere.

One  thing  to  distinguish  the  NES from preceding game consoles was its lockout chip, which didn't allow the machine to play unofficial carts. You could say they learned this lesson from Atari and the  uncontrolled game cartridge speculatory market  which  led  to  a  glut,  then crash (more so than Atari's E.T. or Pac-Man games, contrary to snarky journalists), but perhaps more from their own home market, which had the same lack of control, with third parties producing Famicom games of any possible level of quality.  The  lock-out  enabled  Nintendo  to  exert  control  on  the  cartridge production and market, (perhaps  draconian  control)  and game producers had to play ball if they wanted to get on the system at all (or circumvent the lockout somehow, and probably get sued).

No  matter  what  others  thought about  it,  Nintendo's  approach  became  the  model  for  nearly  everyone's  game  console  markets  since then. In Japan, Nintendo was moving to the 'Disk System' a proprietary  floppy  disk-based  expansion for  their  Famicom,  which  boosted the memory and specs of the base unit somewhat, running games from the disks, and allowing game data to be saved to the disk as well. Several NES games we know today got their start as disk games in Japan,  adapted  because  the  disk  expansion never made it to the US. I don't know exactly why, but in any case the technology of the cartridge games  themselves  were  growing, to the point where the disk system wasn't a big advantage, with hardware included to enable new capabilities, larger games, or battery-backed saving. This is much like Atari and some third parties had already done for the 2600. Additions to the cartridges and clever  programming  made  it  possible to circumvent the console's 4K limit  thru  'bank  switching,'  bringing us games at sizes of 8K, 16K, 32K, and  even  beyond.  Other  carts  or expansions  offered  enhancements to the minimal system RAM, or added new sound channels. (the later Atari  7800  console  offered  some games with extra  audio  hardware

time would have expected it to be remotely capable of recreating later  arcade games like Ms. Pac-Man or Dig-Dug or Stargate, even poorly, much  less  some  of  the  things  the homebrew community would come up with later,  such  as  'Princess  Rescue'  an  unofficial  2600 clone of Super Mario Bros. The Nintendo Famicom/NES was designed to  play  Donkey  Kong  games  and and the first Super Mario was once thought to be the very top end of its ability,  yet  the  NES  had  years  of games to go, with expansive adventures and vast shooters, not to mention two more Super Mario games which make the original look tiny an simplistic by comparison.

can see a lot of the same over the life of the Amiga and its games. Early  Amiga  games  were  often  unimpressive  in  the  light  of  later  ones (and  many  were  direct  ports  of Atari ST or PC games with little enhancement), but motivated Amiga programmers  proved  nearly  anything was possible when they tried, even on a humble Amiga 500 with 1  meg  of  RAM  and  a  floppy  drive (which was practically a game console unto itself back in the day). It was  magical  to  see  what  some could squeeze out of those simple specs, as well as expanded AGA systems, hard drive or CD storage, video or sound expansions, and more.

The world of computers is not quite the same as that of game consoles, as  the  base  hardware  is  not  as much of  a  closed  system,  but  you inside the carts, for example.)

What  makes this stuff special to me is  how  a  piece  of hardware  can  go beyond  its  apparent limits when game designers and  programmers get innovative. When the Atari VCS  came  out  in 1977,  is  was  designed to play games like Combat or Pong, and probably no one at the

The  demo  scene  still  creates  new works  for  classic  Amiga  500  systems, as well as heavily expanded machines. One would never expect a  stock  500  to  rival  a  modern  PC,

just like you wouldn't expect an  Atari  2600  to play  Super  Mario, or the NES to play sprawling multiworld  adventures, so when they come close, it's something pretty special.
