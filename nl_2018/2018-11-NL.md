## New Meeting Location

Beginning  this  month,  we  will  be meeting  at  the  Burleson  Public  Library. This change was brought about when the Grand Prairie Municipal Airport suddenly decided to charge rent for their meeting space at a cost the MCCC cannot afford. MCCC member Steve Eggers, a Burleson resident, has arranged for us to meet at the library at no charge.

Please  note  that  the  meetings  have been  moved  from  Sunday  to  Saturday and from 2:30 to 2:00. Meetings will be held on the second Saturday of the month from 2:00 to 4:00 pm.

## Why Nvidia Ray-Tracing is Exciting

Nvidia recently announced new high-end graphics cards with an RTX designation  attached  to  the  model numbers-that  RTX  indicates the card's enhanced ray tracing abilities, which could bring a whole new level of realism to games. Here's what you need to know about ray tracing and how  it's  going  to  feature  on  the graphics cards of the future.

The  name  is  a  giveaway  as  to  what ray tracing actually is: Trying to determine the path of photons of light in virtual environments, so those virtual environments look as realistic as

possible. Being able to work out how light should fall in a scene requires a lot  of  computing  power,  even  more so as objects and light sources start moving (as they tend to do in games and movies).

Ray  tracing  is  nothing  new.  Coders have been experimenting with it since the very first days of computer graphics.  What  has  changed  over time is how realistic and detailed ray tracing can be, and how fast it can be computed,  and  with  Nvidia's  new cards the technology is taking another jump forward.

## How ray tracing works

Ray tracing attempts to work out the path  of  light  by  imagining  the  eye looking at a scene and working backwards to the light source. The color of  each  pixel  must  be  figured  out based on the objects in a scene, their relationship  to  each  other,  and  the number,  type,  and  position  of  the scene's light sources-not a straightforward set of calculations at all.

The  way  that  light  falls  on  a  black cloth is different to how it falls on a chrome  sphere,  of  course,  and  ray tracing algorithms need to take into account all these properties for every object in view, and every light source hitting  them.  Light  bounces  and  reflects too, making the process of figuring out the colors of a few million pixels even harder.

As a result, it takes a huge amount of processing  power.  We've  seen  high quality  ray  traced  scenes  for  years now, but it's been largely restricted to static images or scenes that can be rendered  a  long  time  in  advance-

movie  CGI  has  been  able  to  deploy ray tracing a long time before video games  because  huge  banks  of  computers  can  spend  days  calculating the physics of a scene.

Pixar even published a paper about how it used ray tracing in the movie Cars. 'Adding ray tracing to the renderer  enables  many  additional  effects such  as accurate  reflections, detailed shadows, and ambient occlusion,' explains Pixar. (Ambient occlusion  is  a  technique  used  to  better work out where light is blocked in a scene, and how that's represented on screen).

A  lot  of  the  impressive  effects  that ray tracing brings-reflections, shadows, refractions-already  exist in computer  games,  but  the  details  of these  effects  are  mostly  fudged  or estimated  by  graphics  artists.  Moving to true, real-time ray tracing has been compared to moving from graphics painted by artists to graphics calculated by physics.

Up until now, games have solely relied on a rendering technique called rasterization, where instead of bombarding a scene with millions of rays of  virtual  light  bouncing  around  in every direction, graphics processors calculate  how  the  millions  of  triangles that make up 3D models should look  when  converted  to  pixels  and flat  2D  images-but  just  one  at  a time.  Simulated  light  rays  coming straight  from  a  virtual  light  source influence the color and brightness of those  rendered  pixels,  but  multiple triangles  can't  affect  each  other,  requiring  shadows,  indirect  illumination, and reflections to all be cleverly simulated.

On the  best  games  of  today,  on  the best hardware,  it  looks  fantasticbut it's still not quite like looking at the real world. Real-time ray tracing promises another step in that direction.

Lighting  is  particularly  hard  to  get right  with  rasterization:  It's  treated more or less as moving in a straight line,  brightening  up  the  sides  of  objects closest to the light and casting a shadow on the other side, but lighting  in  the  real  world  doesn't  quite work like that.

Thanks  to  the  engineers  at  Nvidia, Microsoft, and others, we've now gotten to the stage where ultra-realistic lighting can be mapped out without being pre-rendered. You should see the difference most clearly in complicated lighting setups, where there's a row  of  frosted glass doors, or  a stained glass window, or a waterfall.

## Ray tracing on Nvidia cards

With the switch to the RTX moniker from  GTX,  Nvidia  is  making  a  big noise about the ray tracing capabilities of its new series of cards. Those cards and the Turing GPUs contained within  have  been  engineered  especially  to  cope  with  the  kinds  of  advanced,  demanding  calculations  ray tracing requires.

If  you  think about how light travels through a scene-literally at the speed  of  light-and  how  shadows, reflections, and refractions are formed  (such  as  when  light  passes through water), it's perfectly understandable  why  consumer  graphics cards have taken all this time to get to  a  stage  where  real-time  ray  tracing is possible.

Check out the Shadow of the Tomb Raider demo from Nvidia below, for example.  We've  seen  lighting  tricks like this before, but not in the same detail or with the same level of realism:  Note  how  strong  backlight  is enough  to  turn  objects  and  people into complete silhouettes, something that needs the power of ray tracing to properly work.

It's something engineers and researchers have been working towards  for  half  a  century,  both  in computing  and  movie-making.  The best CGI in films now looks like it's part of the real world, reflections and refractions and all, and now Nvidia's new cards promise to bring the same realism to games.

'Real-time ray tracing replaces a majority of the techniques used today in standard rendering with realistic optical  calculations  that  replicate  the way light behaves in the real world, delivering more lifelike images,' says Nvidia.

Another example shown below comes from an Unreal Engine demo of the technology published back in March.  Look  at  the  detail  and  the quality of the reflections in the scene-suddenly  it's  barely  distinguishable  from  live  action  (though this  demo required a hugely powerful  PC  setup  and  some  background rasterization to work).

The new cards actually split ray tracing  up  into  two  components-ray casting  (tracking  the  paths  of  rays) and  shading  (determining  the  final appearance of objects). The RT cores on the new RTX cards are designed to  speed  up  ray  casting  specifically, so performance increases and visual improvements  will  vary  depending on the geometry of a scene and how much other work there is to do.

Being  the  first  consumer  graphics cards  to  include  specific  hardware for ray tracing, the RTX 2000 series represents another milestone in real-time rendering. Of course shadows,  reflections  and  other  lighting tricks have been in games for years, but now they don't have to be fudged or approximated-they can be finely calculated.

It is still a nascent technology though, and  games  will  have  to  be  written specifically to take advantage of the RTX  hardware.  At  the  moment,  the list  of  games  supporting  the  new standards  is  relatively  thin,  but  it should grow and grow over time. As we've said, the ray tracing revolution won't start overnight, but it is beginning.

## The Latest and a Personal Paint Update

There  has  been  some  news  in  the Amiga arena. A new version of 'classic' Amiga OS3 is available from Hyperion, version  3.1.4,  which  fixes some  long-standing  bugs  from  3.1 and adds a handful of new features, some of which users of 3.5 or 3.9 are familiar with. The update involves an updated  ROM,  though  I'm  not  sure exactly what options are available so far putting the ROM to chip for use in actual hardware.

Over the weekend of October 11 thru 14, we had the 2018 AmiWest show. Undoubtedly news, pictures, and videos  from  the  event  will  be  trickling out  between  this  writing  and  the time of our meeting.

For a third thing, I'll share a link of Youtube series 'The Guru Meditation' featuring a demo of the new Vampire V4  (the  particular  hardware  on  display  being  for  the  Amiga  500).  It's worthy  of  note  for  the  showing  of features  coming  to  V4  and  current Vampire cards, such as recreation of the AGA  chipset,  allowing  Amigamode  video  over  the  HDMI  display. The implementation isn't perfect, with a few visual glitches seen in the demo, and info that interlaced modes don't get along well with HDMI video (so far). Still, I found it most interesting to see, and a good look at what's to come to Amiga.

At the last meeting, I showed off my recent copy of the new(er) Personal Paint  version  7.3b  from  Aeon  after they bought the rights from Cloanto. For  the  uninitiated,  Personal  Paint, or PPaint, is a paint program for color-mapped images or animations (up to  256  colors  in  the  palette).  What set  PPaint  apart  from  its  predecessors and contemporaries is, while it works  very  similar  to  mainstay  Deluxe Paint in terms of interface style, it gets along well with RTG and video cards  for  the  most  part,  making  it useful in ways that programs limited to Amiga chipset only modes like Deluxe Paint or Brilliance weren't. Thus PPaint, which made it to version 7.1 under publisher Cloanto,  became popular with many users of expanded Amiga systems, especially when it was released for free distribution after Cloanto shifted focus to its Amiga emulator packages.

While PPaint 7.1 did a fine job, it had a  few  quirks  and  issues.  One  such problem appeared in systems other than  classic  Amigas,  such  as  those running OS4, MorphOS, or running a Vampire accelerator, for example. The  software  had  small  deviations from  standard  Amiga  OS  programming  that  hitched  on  these  newer systems, resulting in graphical glitches,  freezes,  or  painted  filled  shapes not  working  properly.  Users  clam- ored for ports to OS4 and MorphOS, which  didn't  amount  to  much  for years,  until  Aeon  started  buying  up rights  to  various  Amiga  software packages with the purpose of updating them with an aim toward the Amiga OS4 systems they produce, non-committaly  promising  updates for legacy OS3 and MorphOS as well.

Personal  Paint  7.3  was  one  of  their first  to  bear  fruit,  so  to  speak.  Versions  were  produced  for  OS3  and OS4 Amigas, available via CD or online  distribution.  A  direct  MorphOS port is not apparently planned, as the OS3 version should work with that. I bought the OS3 version of Personal Paint  from  AmigaKit  (approx.  $17 without shipping) with a certain amount  of  blind  faith  that  issues plaguing version 7.1 on MorphOS systems  would  be  fixed.  I've  only  had limited  hands-on  experience  with the new 7.3 Personal Paint so far, but I would list it as a mixed bag currently, at least for the uses I wish to get out of it. Firstly,  PPaint  requires some Amiga library files not included on  the  disc  to  run  properly,  mainly the font-handling 'bullet.library.' This is only a problem for operating systems that don't include it, such as MorphOS,  so  be  prepared  to  move some files over from an Amiga installation  if  need  be.  As  to  be  expected, performance on most things are pretty snappy on a PowerPC or Vampire system, notably faster than  my 68060 Amiga at least. One of the larger  problems  running  PPaint  7.1  on MorphOS (and a Vampirized Amiga. I discovered) is creating a filled shape, either by freehand or polygon drawing,  did  not  work  correctly,  giving either an unfilled shape or an error message. I was happy to find this was apparently  no  longer  a  problem  on 7.3, with fills of all types working fine on Vampire and MorphOS systems.

A separate issue, however, did carry over from old to new. On MorphOS at least,  there  are  strange  behaviors when modifying colors in the palette. Moving the sliders for the RGB components of a color seem to work fine, but doing the same for the HSV values result in strange behavior in the color  you're  working  on,  from  overshooting the mark to a full-on freak out.  Finally, I did run into some circumstances which froze up the program,  from  attempting  to  play  an animation using an HD  graphics mode (Vampire, though to be fair no version of Personal Paint handled animation via video card too smoothly) and, perhaps most unforgivably, the program froze on MorphOS, using up nearly all available CPU according to the  monitor,  immediately  after  saving  the  image  I  was  working  on.  I plan to do further testing depending on available time, finding out exactly which errors affect which platforms. I also hope to bring the Vampire 600 in for some hands-on PPaint 7.3 testing at the meeting. As it stands now though, I'd rate Personal Paint 7.3 as not  quite  ready  for  prime-time,  at least  not  if  you  hope  to  use  it  on  a MorphOS machine. Perhaps tests will show it faring better on Amiga/Vampire. Time will tell.
