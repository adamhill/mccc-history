## The Amiga Consciousness

There  exists  a  global  community,  a loosely knit consciousness of individuals  that  crosses  boundaries  of  language and artistic disciplines. It resides in both the online and physical space, its followers are dedicated, if not fervent. The object and to some extent,  philosophy  that  unites  these adherents, is a computer system called the Commodore Amiga. So why does a machine made by a company that  went  bankrupt  in  1994  have  a cult-like  following?  Throughout  this essay I will present to you, the reader, a  study  of  qualitative  data  that  has been collected at community events, social  gatherings  and  conversations. The resulting narrative is intended to illuminate the origins of the community,  how  it  is  structured  and  how members  participate  in  it.  Game  industry professionals, such as the person interviewed during the research for this paper, will attest to the properties, characteristics and creative application  of  the  machine,  and  how this  creativity  plays  a  role  in  the sphere of their community. I will examine  the  bonds  of  the  society,  to determine if the creative linage of the computer plays a role in community interactions.

The story of the Amiga and its maker, Commodore,  is  a  long  and  complex tale. Confusing it with a Tolstoy saga could be forgiven. The purpose of this study is not to retell the origins of the Amiga  computer  or  the  demise  of Commodore,  but  instead  to  look  at the people that surround  today's close knit global community.

Home computing  was  undergoing  a revolution  during  the  mid  1980's. Computing  power  and  connectivity were on the rise while the entry cost into  the  hobby  was  dropping.  The market was awash with systems that were  all  jockeying  for  pole  position. One system that stood out from the rest  was  the  Commodore  Amiga,  a system so unique and powerful for its time, it had Steve Jobs of Apple Computer  nervous.  In  1985,  the  Apple Mac  was  limited  to  a  grayscale  display,  where  as  the  Amiga  had  color modes that went up to 4096 colors.

Membership is informal and very few User Groups (interacting users based in a similar geographic location) exist that require registration. This differs from operations in the past. Local User Groups in the 80's and 90's typically  required  member  dues  and  were operational  around  the  world.  Frequency of meetings varied from weekly to monthly. In a much more limited  scope  a  number  of  these groups have either survived through the  decades  or  reformed  in  new  capacities, as can be seen at local meetings  and  their  presence  at  yearly conferences.  The  observed  population  segment  that  attends  meetings and conferences is typically older, averaging from mid 30's to late 50's and mostly  male.  With  the  exception  of smaller  User  Group  meetings,  most events that occur are on the scale of 200-300  people  and  cover  a  wide geographic area. Conferences are quite affairs-the primary goal is to impart knowledge in a social setting. The  unmistakable  hum  of  old  CRT monitors  serves  as  ambient  white noise,  occasionally  punctured  by  a computer game melody and cheerful laughter.  Some  machines  are  to  be observed, from  a distance. Either

they are rare and valuable or delicate and  difficult  to  maintain.  However, these  machines  were  made  to  be used,  and  standing  alongside  the  interactive  exhibits,  their  owners  are typically ready and more than willing to answer any questions.

The nature of the community and format of events enables individuals of all levels to participate how they see fit.  Meetings  and  larger  shows  are frequented  by  members  imparting their historical knowledge about the computer, games, demo and BBS (Bulletin Board System) scene. It's quite likely some members didn't make the conscious decision to become affiliated, instead their connection evolved out of their interest in computing, art or  music.  For  others,  collaborating with people of complimentary skills sets has produced new hardware designs  that  weren't  thought  possible 30 years ago. Active participation in forums  and  group  discussion  helps mold  the  direction  of  projects,  further adding to the intellectual wealth of the community as a whole.

Software demos that are seen showcasing the capabilities of the Amiga at conferences or another type of event called 'Demo Parties,' are decedents from a programing and art inspired sub-culture  called  the  'Demoscene.' The Amiga can be partially attributed to the creation of this related sub-culture. Individuals with specialized talents  in  art,  audio  production  and programming, who teamed together to form a group, are collectively known  a  Demogroup.  Together,  the art  and  effects  produced  push  the computer to new limits.  Competition between groups was, and often still is, very competitive, with one group trying  to  outdo  another  with  a  style  of coding  technique.  Today,  is  not  uncommon at community events to find the the products of demo parties running  on  either  original  30  year  old hardware,  or  being  emulated  on  a modern laptop. Programmers are often coding 'close to the metal.' That is, the languages they are using, have the minimal amount of interpretation by the computer that require the program to run, they are directly accessing physical parts of the machine. The simplicity of the Amiga that enables this type of coding is an incentive to younger  generations-the  'style'  of the machine allows them to show off their  skills.  Younger  members  are forming a solid base primarily in online forums, but also at physical demo parties. The logical conclusion is that these  individuals  are  one  way  the community will continue to grow, as the older generations inevitably pass on.

Let us reference back to the primary assertion:  the  Amiga  computer  is  a tool  that  binds  creative  individuals into  a  community.  To  understand that statement, we must look at how the  creative  empowerment, enabled by the Amiga, gave rise to  careers in the game industry. When questioned with:  What  was  your  favorite  platform to develop on 'Back in the day?', the  response  from  an  interviewed seasoned developer was: The Amiga home  computer,  a  machine  with  a custom  chipset  for  handling  sound, video  and  I/O  (input  and  output  to the computer). Combined with a low price  point,  the  Amiga  was  the  best choice for game development with its powerful graphic capabilities.

Secondly, let us consider the response  another  question:  When  do you define the 'Golden age' of video games?  Answer:  Probably  1987  to 1988, the C-64 was in full swing and the 16-bit machines (the  Amiga) were just starting to take hold of the market.  Game  development  teams were growing in size in terms of numbers but they were still small enough for each member to feel the contribution of their efforts.

The underlying message that can be extrapolated  is  creativity,  an  important function for this  interviewee. We can juxtaposition this inferred importance against observations at User  Group  meetings,  to  assume  that the glue of the community, the reason these individuals are meeting, is the creative  capabilities  of  the  machine. When we position the origins of the Amiga  community-what  it  enabled users  to  do:  coding,  art  and  music, next to the observed creative output that is  still  being  presented  at  meetings, the conclusion suggests the forces of attraction to the community are not  only  a  notion  of  nostalgia  for  a games machine, but the act of creativity itself.

The achievements of the individuals that  conceptualized  the  Amiga  computer  are  highly  recognized.  Engineers  that  worked  for  Commodore, such  as  Dave  Haynie  in  the  1980's and 1990's along with hardware developers that continue development, command  enthusiastic  audiences  at community  events  throughout  the year. It  has  been  witnessed through observation at these events their willingness to meet and talk with not only  small,  intimate  groups,  but  also large audiences. It could be inferred that these actions not only help preserve  the  legacy  of  their  work,  but they are also functioning as ambassadors for the community. Their efforts and openness introduce people to the platform  who  might  not  have  been users  during  the  machines  commercial years, and help the community to thrive and expand.

Observations in the field have shown there is a specialized niche for newly produced hardware that typically enhances existing machines or replaces faulty components. Vendors and technicians  present  at  conferences  perform technical services, many of whom do it for  the  love  of  the  platform,  and  of  course,  a  nominal  fee. Tucked away in corner locations, surrounded by machine carcasses, toolkits, soldering irons and empty caffeinated beverage cans, engineers can  be  found  laboring  on  delicate hardware.  The  long  lines  of  customers  imply  demand  for  their  skill  is high.  This  observation  of  dedication, seen at events and in the online realm, reinforces the notion that individuals embrace their technical contribution. Their goals are not solely profit driven, and they are finding their niche in the community with this service.

Families  play  an  important  role  at conventions. A large diversity of activities are available to entertain younger  children  that  accompany  parents. Finding kids glued to a monitor playing  a  platform  game  is  a  common sight.  Introducing  children  not  only continues  the  community  and  provides  them  with  a  glimpse  of  their parents' youth, but has the added benefit  of  helping  them  understand  the core  concepts  of  computing-something which is often difficult to comprehend on modern systems.

To summarize the findings observed during community conferences, meetings,  social  media  engagements  and dialog from interviews, the catalysts for  community  engagement  can  be identified as:

- An outlet for creativity-art, music, animation.
- Intellectual  challenge-programming, electrical engineering.
- Historical  connection-familiarity  and  lengthy  community interaction.
- Nostalgia-Games played  in  the past, introducing children to component of the parents' youth.

With this information, would it be reasonable to speculate, the term 'Amiga'  not  only  describes  a  computer, but also a community who's collaborations continue to find new ways of expressing art?  It's  a  vision  or  nontangible  quality  that  cannot  be  described  by  the  computers  physical form  of  silicon  and  ABS  plastic.  I would postulate that it is not an enormous stretch to draw the conclusion that  the  Amiga community isn't centered  around  its  physical  attributes. Instead, the community is defined as a collective consciousness of creativi- ty and camaraderie, who's inclusivity is not limited by an individual's own aptitude for any one creative or technical outlet.

## The Vampire Saga

Hopefully you all have made it though  March  and  April  up  to  this point, whether the Easter season, or tax season, or the political season, or just  seasonal  weather  (which  apparently  had  no  idea  what  the  word 'spring' meant this year). At least the Amiga fans got an unusual amount of news to offset the annoyances of the last couple of months.

Version 5 of MUI, the GUI toolkit for classic and PPC-based Amigas, came out recently, though it appears it may be geared to the higher-powered systems.  The  Apollo  Accelerator  group has released version 2.8 of the Apollo core  for  the  Vampire  500  and  600 FPGA cards in March, hot on the heels of  2.7,  followed  by  version  2.9  in April. 2.8 fixed some bugs in the FPU code and added support for the V500's  expansion  connector,  while 2.9  focuses  on  ROM  mapping  separate  from  the  CPU  core  itself,  seemingly in preparation for potential application  of  Vampire  cards  to  the Atari ST range of computers, and other future plans undoubtedly. More on my Vampire experiences to follow.

After no public releases for well over a year, the MorphOS team has finally released version 3.10 of their operating system, one of the largest updates to  the  system  in  a  long  time,  both under  the  hood  and  on  the  surface: adding  support  for  new  hardware (though  I'm  still  having  issues  with my USB scanner) and more. I couldn't give an adequate rundown of the full list  of  additions,  so  check  the  links earlier in the newsletter.

I've repeatedly written in these newsletter  articles  about  the  long  and winding saga of VampireQuest™. Nowadays, I have my hardware and it works nicely, but with the gift of hindsight,  the  quest  looked  more  than  a tiny bit like some strange, systematic years-long campaign to jerk  me around.  That  may  be  a  hyperbolic overreaction, but if you look over the timeline of events, you might agree.

- March  2016-I  get  some  of  my first  information about the Vampire 600 V2, and e-mail the North American hardware producer, Kipper2K to declare my interest.
- April  2016-Waiting  on  a  reply, as the hardware was hand-made at the time, leading to slow firstcome-first-served production, and a long lead time before any replies.
- July 2016-No  reply  yet, but news that Altera FPGA chip prices are going up after the company was acquired by Intel means the price of cards will go up from the 150 Euro original price.
- August 2016-I  receive  word and a 'declare your interest' form from Apollo, so they know I exist.  I  coin  the  term  'Vampire Quest' in my newsletter articles.
- October 2016-I get word that a Vampire board is reserved for me. Pricing sets V600 boards at over $300. (Technically still a deal for what it does.)
- November  2016-Kipper's  site says  first  batch  of  boards  is  finished and shipping, second batch is being worked on. Production is being  revamped  to  meet  heavy demand. I hear nothing.
- December  2016-Kipper  is  recovering from hand surgery, with grisly online photo posted.
- March  2017-Kipper's  site  lists that  all  V600  orders  have  been fulfilled,  but  I've  heard  nothing. Time to start loading up Kipper's in-box.
- May  2017-I  am  told  my  V600 board will be part of this month's batch to be manufactured.
- July 2017-Finally receive a payment  request,  and  the  board  is finally  paid  for,  just  in  time  for
- cards to be sold through dealers like AmigaKit.
- August 2017-While waiting, the new V4 line of Vampire cards is announced.
- September  2017-Still  waiting, and news comes out that Kipper is  quitting  the  team,  leaving  my order in doubt.
- November  2017-I  contact  the Apollo team to inquire, am told to ask  Kipper.  Finally  get  in  touch with Kipper, who tells me my order was not yet fulfilled thanks to a mix-up with a different Schwartz out of Germany. I finally receive my Vampire 600 card and  show  it  off  at  the  meetingnot yet installed in my Amiga 600.
- December 2017-Board  is installed, after some fumbling, difficulty, and mistakes.
- March 2018-The new 'Gold 2.7' core  is  released.  When  I  try  to install it, the system gets bricked, forcing me to buy a 'USB Blaster' chip  programmer  to  install  updates  from  an  external  system. After fumbling to get things working again with help from the Prez, the new core in installed, but HDMI  video  is  in  black  and  white now. It was not well documented, but starting with 2.7, the Apollo team added a white list of board serial numbers  into the core revisions to discourage unofficial hardware,  so  if  you  hadn't  yet registered  your  board  on  their website  (or  the  entity  you  ordered from didn't do it for you), you get the B&amp;W video output. I registered as soon as I found out, but  'Gold  2.8'  comes  out  the same day. I try to install, and the system bricks again. I do the external  installation,  and  the  system  is  displaying  in  B&amp;W,  as expected.
- April 2018-'Gold 2.9' is released,  thankfully.  Even  better, the standard installation is actually successful this time. It doesn't brick the system, and my registration was apparently accepted, as the color display is back. Before you think everything is  good though, I get a new mail from the

Apollo  team  telling  me  'Great News! A Vampire 600 board has been  allocated for you!' As I didn't order a new one, this was a fresh new merry mix-up, which I wrote in to correct, just in case it was  something  that  might  bite someone  else's  order,  and  not just me.

## Apple Powered by Renewable Energy

April 9, 2018

Apple today announced that its global facilities, including retail stores, offices,  data  centers,  and  more, are powered with 100 percent clean energy.

Apple's 100 percent clean energy figure encompasses facilities in 43 countries, including the United States, UK, China, and India. In a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple is "committed  to  leaving  the  world  better than we found it."

'We're  committed  to  leaving  the world  better  than  we  found  it. After  years  of  hard  work  we're proud to have reached this significant  milestone,"  said  Tim  Cook, Apple's CEO. "We're going to keep  pushing  the  boundaries  of what is possible with the materials  in  our  products,  the  way  we recycle  them,  our  facilities  and our work with suppliers to estab- lish  new  creative  and  forwardlooking sources of renewable energy because we know the future depends on it."

To reach its clean energy goals, Apple has  invested  in  and  constructed  renewable  energy  facilities  all  around the world, such as solar arrays, wind farms, biogas fuel cells, micro-hydration  generation  systems,  and  other energy storage technologies.

Apple  says  it  has  25  operational  renewable energy projects around the world, totaling 626 megawatts of generation  capacity.  286  megawatts  of solar  PV  generation  came  online  in 2017,  which  Apple  says  is  the  most ever in a single year. An additional 15 projects are under construction, and once finished, will offer a total of 1.4 gigawatts of clean renewable energy generation across 11 countries.

Some  of  Apple's  renewable  energy projects  include  the  solar  panels  on the  roof  of  Apple  Park,  its  newest campus, 485 megawatts of wind and solar  projects  across  China,  solar  facilities  in  Reno,  Nevada  and  Maiden, North Carolina, more than 300 rooftop  solar  systems  in  Japan,  and  an 800-rooftop  renewable  energy  system in Singapore.

Reaching 100 percent renewable energy for all Apple facilities has been a longtime goal for the company. Since 2014,  100  percent  of  Apple's  data centers have been powered by clean energy, and since 2016, 96 percent of Apple facilities  have  been  run  on  renewable energy.

## May Calendar

May 13 - MCCC Meeting 2:30 PM - Grand Prairie Airport 3116 S. Great Southwest Parkway, Grand Prairie

May 13 - Board of Director's Meeting Approximately 4:30 PM - Location TBD

June 3 - Newsletter Deadline - 8:00 AM

In  an  interview  with  Fast  Company, Apple VP of environment, policy, and social  initiatives  Lisa  Jackson  said that Apple has been working hard in recent months to ink energy deals to cover  its  remotest  offices  and  retail stores  in  countries  like  Brazil,  India, Israel, Mexico, and Turkey.

"If  you look at our trajectory, for the  last  couple  of  years  we've been close to 100%, It's just four percent  more,  but  it's  four  percent done the right way. So this announcement feels like a classic Apple  product  release.  Like  our products,  we  sweat  the  details, we  have  pretty  strict  standards, and we prefer to wait and meet our  standards  than  to  rush  and make a claim."

Since 2011, Apple's projects have reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by 54 percent and prevented close to 2.1 million metric tons of CO2e from entering the atmosphere.

Apple has also been pushing its suppliers to use clean energy, and along with its own announcement, nine additional manufacturing powers have committed to using renewable energy sources, bringing the total number of supplier commitments to 23. New suppliers that plan to use renewable energy include Quanta Computer, Pegatron, Finisar, and more.
