## AT&amp;T and Verizon in Rural America

$60  a  month  for  10  Mbps  DSL broadband? That's the same price AT&amp;T  charges  for  its  50  Mbps  Uverse service.

Talk about unfair. Millions of broadband customers in rural and underserved  urban  markets  are paying  nearly  identical  prices  for slower  DSL  service  as  customers who have access to high-speed fiber services.

That's the conclusion from a report published this week by the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA), which  advocates  for  more  equitable broadband deployment.

In places where AT&amp;T and Verizon don't  offer  their  high-speed  fiberbased broadband, they continue to sell  customers  slower-speed  DSL service.  But  recently,  the  companies have been eliminating lowertier  plans,  which  has  resulted  in higher prices for the base cost of service. But in areas where the networks haven't been upgraded, like rural  regions  of  the  country  or low-income  urban  markets,  this means customers are paying more for slower service.

Take  AT&amp;T  as  an  example.  The company is charging $60 a month for  DSL  with  speeds  ranging  between 6 and 10Mbps, according to the white paper. This is the same price, after the first year discounts

end, that AT&amp;T charges its U-verse broadband customers, who  get download speeds between 50Mbps and 75Mbps.

Verizon's pricing is similar. It charges $65 a month for 100Mbps Fios service, and about $63  a month for DSL service, which tops out at between 1.5Mbps and 15Mbps.

NDIA argues that AT&amp;T and Verizon  have  been  eliminating  their cheaper rate tiers and leaving the midrange  price  point.  But  they haven't upgraded the DSL networks and have left the speeds of those services low.

"Each company now charges essentially identical monthly prices$63-$65  a  month  after  first-year discounts  have  ended-for  home wireline  broadband  connections at almost any speed up to 100/100 Mbps fiber service," the white paper said.

AT&amp;T said in a statement that the results of this study are misleading.

"Attempting to assess internet service  offerings  by  only  looking  at standard rates does not give a complete picture; the internet service market  is  more  competitive  than ever  and  most  customers  make their purchases at bundled and discounted rates," the company said in a statement.

The  company  says  it  hasn't  eliminated speed tiers but instead has

"simplified" its pricing with an "entry level price point that's remained  relatively  constant  while the speed offered has increased."

It also notes that DSL is generally more expensive  to  maintain.  And because this service is typically offered  in  areas  where  there  isn't enough population density to justify the cost of a fiber-based service, there are fewer customers, which increases the cost per customer.

A Verizon spokesman agreed.

"In terms of pricing, rural areas are challenging  in  that  there's  higher costs  involved  in  providing  and maintaining  DSL  and  it  isn't  always feasible to build fiber to the home,"  said  Raymond  McConville, a  Verizon  spokesman.  "Our  products are priced competitively in all of our markets."

Verizon also disagrees with the assertion  that  the  company  is  not investing in DSL upgrades in rural markets. In January, it announced it would deploy fiber to over 15,000  homes  in  rural  upstate New  York.  Last  week,  New  York state announced Verizon would deploy fiber to another 50,000 homes.  Verizon  has  also  brought its Fios fiber service to several new towns in southern New Jersey, including some areas that had limited or no broadband access, McConville added.

"In  the  areas  where  we  haven't brought fiber, we continue invest- ing  to  maintain  and  improve  the performance of the DSL network," he  said.  "It  wasn't  that  long  ago that  speeds  topped  out  at  only  a few Mbps-now  we  reach 15 Mbps in some areas thanks to our investment in the network."

New technologies like 5G wireless could  also  be  game-changing  for delivering  high-speed  broadband to  rural  areas  where  deploying fiber is not feasible, he added.

Still,  the  report  comes  as  policy makers take a closer look at broadband access and the digital divide that exists between urban and suburban markets and rural America. Nearly  24  million  Americans  do not have access to broadband with download  speeds  of  at  least  25 Mbps  and  uploads  of  3  Mbps,  according to the Federal Communications Commission.

A  large  majority  of  these  unconnected  or  underconnected  Americans live in rural areas where it's expensive  to  build  infrastructure and deliver service. The situation also happens to be in parts of the country where there's little if any competition. And that seems to be a  better  predictor  of  whether  the networks  have  been  upgraded  to higher speeds.

A report published earlier this week  by  the  Institute  for  Local Self-Reliance, a public interest nonprofit,  shows  that  big  cable  and telecommunications companies have invested most heavily in network  upgrades  in  areas  where they face competition. Meanwhile, in  markets where no competition exists, network speeds lag.

"Efforts to increase investment from the largest firms in more rural  areas  have  largely  failed,"  the report  said.  "Though  states  have varied regulations, the same trend results in every state-investment by  the  large  ISPs  is  correlated  to competition rather than the regulatory Environment."

## Gorilla Glass 6 On The Way

Gorilla Glass 6 tackles the problem of cumulative smartphone damage

Every year, Corning says the newest  version  of  Gorilla  Glass  is  better  than  the  last.  Gorilla  Glass  4 survived drops "up to 80 percent of  the  time"  when  dropped  "face down from one meter," while Gorilla Glass 5 survived "80 percent of the time" from 1.6-meter drops onto a rough surface. This new glass concoction is designed to take multiple  drops,  though,  with  Corning saying  it  can  survive  "15  drops from 1 meter onto rough surfaces." (One  meter  is  a  little  more  than three feet.)

This year, the company is tackling repeated  damage  that  is  inflicted on  a  display.  While  a  brand  new piece  of  Gorilla  Glass  might  survive  any  single  drop,  the  micro abrasions  incurred  from  multiple drops  weaken  the  display  panel and make it more likely to break next time.  Corning  says  Gorilla Glass 6 should reach the market in "the next several months."

Coming soon to a smartphone near you: it's Gorilla Glass 6, the latest version of  Corning's  ubiquitous smartphone display cover. Gorilla Glass typically sits between the display  and  the  outside  world,  protecting  your  precious  pixels  from damage. Lately, manufacturers have been using it for the back of the phone, too.
