## My MorphOS Computer Problems

Greeting Amigans! I don't know if it's been a good summer so far, but it has been interesting at least. Apparently my backyard has become a wildlife preserve for foxes, which I personally chose to find awesome. (video evidence available upon request).

It's not as easy to find Amiga news currently, as the Amiga.org site has been  down  for  months  now.  Perhaps the headline news of recent is the  release  of  MorphOS  version 3.11, mainly consisting of bug fixes and minor updates, as befitting the smaller decimal number increase. I was initially planning to hold off on the upgrade until I had less work to do,  but  my  G5  system  seemed  to make the decision for me.

I was having problems, which turned out to be a disk error in the system  partition.  It's  unknown  exactly  what  caused  it-presumably something like a reboot or crash or something while the disk was writing-but the system was becoming nigh-unusable because of it. It also prevented me from upgrading the operating  system  until  the  error was fixed.

I tried running the 'SFSDoctor' disk  scan  and  repair  utility  after booting  from  the  Morph  3.11  CD, but  the  program  kept  hanging  before  it  could  fix  anything.  Since  it was looking like an impasse, I took a different approach. When I set up

my G5 system, I gave it a terabyte hard  drive,  which,  not  being  on  a Windows machine nor used to download  tons  of  HD  videos,  is drastic storage overkill. Since I had at least one mostly-empty partition still  available,  I  set  it  as  bootable and  made  a  fresh  install  of  MorphOS 3.11 to that partition, figuring that would give me a good place to work from to either salvage the old system  drive,  or  start  anew  if  I couldn't. The plan apparently worked, as I booted from the new system  partition  (AKA  'Gadget') and ran SFSDoctor from there to fix the 'classic' system partition without a hitch.

Exactly why the program ran well from a hard drive boot and not a CD boot  I  can't  say.  Regardless,  the problem  was  fixed,  the  system  is booting properly from the originally  intended  drive  partition,  and now I have a redundant system installation should it come in handy later. On the downside, I didn't get any  appreciable  work  done  that day,  as  all  my  time  was  taken  up diagnosing and working to fix the machine's  problem(s),  as  well  as the  OS  installation  that  wound  up linked to it  all.  I  suppose  I  should count my blessings, as a lost day of productivity is infinitely preferable to  an  unusable  system and all the lost work that would cause.

## Google Search Tips and Tricks

An incomplete list:

1. To  search  for  an  exact  phrase, enclose the phrase in quotes. A search for 'Amiga games' will show only results where those two  words  occur  in  sequence: exactly and shown.
2. To exclude terms, use a minus sign. A search for 'Amiga games' -Pacman will  find  the same results as before, but will eliminate  any  matches  where the word Pacman shows up.
3. Search for a term within a web-
4. site like this: site:amigamccc.org kelly will pull up any mention of our illustrious  leader  that  appears  on our website.
4. You can use an asterisk to serve as a wildcard. Search 'The most  powerful  *' to  find  the most powerful anything.
5. You  can  set  a  range  for  your
7. search.
8. US Presidents 1920..1990 will  show  presidents  between those years. (That's the first value, followed by two periods, followed by the second value.)
6. You can also use a single value. US  President  ..2010 will  return Barack Obama.
7. Ranges  can  also  be  used  for price matching. For example, if you  wanted  to  find  a  camera that  costs  between  $400  and $600, the search term camera $400..$600 would return only those within that price range.
8. You can quickly find the definition  of  any  word  or  acronym. define html will quickly return the definition.
9. Automated coin toss? No problem. Enter flip a coin into  the search bar.
10. Try do a barrel roll just for fun.
11. Or try askew .
12. Use Google for simple math conversions. 5  miles  to  km will quickly return the value of 8.04672. 1 quart to liters will return: 0.946353.
13. Use  the  word  nearby  to  find businesses close to where you are. Restaurants nearby will show…wait  for  it…restaurants nearby.
14. Want to know what your public IP  address  is?  Just  type IP  address in the search bar. (You'll probably  see  an  IP6  address that is quite different than your local address.)
15. Want  to  know  the  weather? Just  type  weather  followed  by your zip code: weather 75104 .
16. You can search for specific filetypes. Amiga filetype:pdf will return pdf files referencing Amiga. Searching for: site:amigamccc.org filetype:pdf will return all the pdf files on our club website.
17. You  can  track  packages  by  entering your tracking number directly  into  the  Google  search bar.  This  works  for  UPS,  USPS and FedEx.
18. Need a quick translation? Type translate word to french (where word is any word and
22. french  is  any  language).    The actual response to my example is mot .
19. You  can  check  sunrise  or  sunset times for any location. Just enter sunrise 75104 or sunset 75104 where 75104 is the zip code. Addresses or city names work as well.
20. Need to check flight status? No need  to  go  to  the  airline  website.  Just  enter  the  airline  and
25. flight number into Google search  and  the  status  will  be returned. For example, aa 1445 will  return the flight status for American Airlines flight 1445.
21. Need  to  know  the  time  somewhere in the world? Time London will show the current time in London, England.
