## Developments: Current, Past and Future

Instead of news or the like, I'll begin my column this month with a story of my trials. You might remember my column a couple months back, where I noted I was having some problems with my G5 MorphOS system as I worked to install the new 3.11 version of the OS. Well, a couple  days  ago  (as  of  this  writing)  a seemingly new problem arose. The system refused to boot-just one of those 'I decide not to work today' things computers are known to occasionally do. I was  worried,  as  I  use  the  system  for work, and it's a little hard to figure out what's  wrong  if  you  can't  get  the  machine running.

With a little fumbling, I was able to get my system to boot from the MorphOS install CD. Since the machine appeared to  be  working  normally  from  there,  I started thinking the problem might be more  software  than  hardware-based. After a little  checking,  the  problem showed  itself  as  a  repeat  of  my  issue from a couple months ago-a disk error, but this time getting in the way of the boot  process  instead  of  just  messing with  the  web  browser.  Another  difference  this  time  is  I  still  had  the  redundant OS install I set up before, so after switching  around  boot  priorities,  The machine  was  booting  again  without  a hitch. I tried to run the 'SFSDoctor' to fix the  disk  error,  but  this  time  I  was  unable to successfully get the fix done. At least I have the spare OS to work from, and  was  able  to  (mostly)  back  up  my original  OS  partition  so  I  could  pretty much continue without missing a step, aside from having my old small OS partition  sitting  there  with  'do  not  cross' crime scene tape over it.

I'm not sure exactly what went wrong. It seems as though the disk error(s) are linked to the Odyssey Web Browser in some way, either by some power-off or other interruption occurring while the browser was writing to  disk,  or  possibly  the  browser  cache  writing  to  the same sectors over and over and weakening them, like wearing a path in the carpet. I'm investigating the possibility of directing the web browser caches to a different little-used disk partition, but if not, I'm hoping the 'worn carpet' metaphor is correct, and I've bought several more  years  by  moving  to  a  different, barely-used block. Regardless, I'll have to keep my eyes open for potential disk problems, and prepare for the possibility that I might need to get a new hard drive before too long.

On a different note, one day I was looking some things up and learned that in 1971, the year I was born, the first commercial all-in-one microprocessor chip, the  Intel  4004  with  the  full  power  of four bits and three quarters of a megahertz,  was  released.  At  this  point  I  understood, though in many ways I already knew, that my life has covered the  entirety  of  the  modern  computer era, the consumer computer era. While I can't say I recall every Altair kit or TV pong  machine,  I  can  say  I've  experienced many of the highlights.

My family got the Atari 2600 VCS when they were a new thing. I remember the 'big three' of 1977, the Apple II, the Radio Shack TRS-80, and the Commodore PET. By the early eighties my family had a Commodore 64, so I was well-versed in the idea of a computer built around a command  line  and  a  BASIC  language interpreter, largely there to run games and other software from tape, disk, or cartridge.

By the mid-eighties, the sixteen bit era was starting to take hold, along with a paradigm  shift.  The  graphic  interface

was growing, along with the mouse and WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) ideas 'borrowed' from the Xerox PARC research group, spawning Apple's Lisa and  Macintosh,  the  Atari  ST,  the  Commodore  Amiga,  and  the  latecomer  Microsoft  Windows  (so  good  PC  users stuck  with  straight  DOS  for  quite  a while). Meanwhile the US gaming market was taken by storm (after a crash) by  Nintendo,  using  a  machine  already considered  borderline  obsolete  in  its home market of Japan at the time (but then it got better).

I  remember  the  nineties  largely  as  a war of bits and clock speeds. Game consoles  warred  with  escalating  numbers of  bits,  while  their  fans  argued  over whether each was 'really' 64-bit or not, and  whether  that  actually  made  one better  than  another.  Meanwhile,  the computer industry and dealers touted how many megahertz their CPU could pump  out,  also  to  much  debate  as  to whether  that  translated to a faster, smoother experience for the user or not. Unfortunately this was the time we lost Commodore, as it struggled to compete in a market increasingly dominated by Windows  PCs  (and  flail  at  'cash  cow' consumer  goods  like  game  consoles). The  Amiga  system  they  helped  spawn continued for a while, and attempted to advance  in  various  forms  and  directions, but it would never regain its (relative)  prominence seen in the late '80s and early '90s.

The '00s would see the Intel-based PC become a dominant standard unto itself, where  it  seemed  like  every  computer was roughly the same hardware, whether  it  ran  Windows,  or  some  breed  of Linux, or Apple's Mac OSX. Computers moved from expensive tech toy to kids' educational tool and game machines to an  appliance  with  the  internet  on  it. While  some  people  cared  about  the specs  of  their  system  (bleeding-edge gamers mostly), many didn't really wor- ry too much about what CPU or video card or OS was part of their machine as long as it did what they wanted it to do. Into  that  environment  stepped  a  new contender, and along with it a new paradigm. It started with MP3 players and Palm Pilots, which merged with cellular phones,  and  Apple,  finding  all  these pre-existing  ideas  and  whipping  them into  slick,  easy-to-use  new  packages that made people believe they were allnew inventions, from iPod to iPhone.

With the 2010s, the 'smartphones,' and their tablet bigger brothers had all but taken  over  the  casual  duties  people used desktop or laptop computers for a few short years earlier. The hardware from these devices spreads to make our clocks or refrigerators or whole houses into networked 'smart' things. Voice interfaces  grow  in  ability,  to  the  point where we approach a paradigm of living  with  chatty,  'Star  Trek'-style  computer usage. However, even as computers and devices grow more powerful  and  ubiquitous,  nostalgia  grows alongside it, with classic computers and game systems from past decades recreated  or  emulated,  so  the  past  can  be relived and people can enjoy the uncomplicated games of their youth, or even play  all-new  games  designed  in  the style of past classics.

I think a little about our hometown heroes,  the  Wright  brothers.  It's  worth considering that Orville Wright  survived  until  1948,  and  I  can't  help  but wonder what it must have been like for him as one of THE pioneers of powered flight, to see aircraft develop and change  over  the  years,  through  two world  wars,  to  the  early  jet  age,  into something  wholly  different  from  the 1903  Wright  Flyer,  yet  built  on  the same principles.

Sometimes I think the same about computers. An Altair 8800 is not a Commodore 64 is not an Amiga 4000 is not an iMac is not a Samsung Galaxy Note. An Atari VCS is not an Amiga CD-32 is not an X-Box is not a Nintendo Switch. None of them will be what we might see in the future, but all of them are, at heart, the same  thing,  a  microprocessor-based computing device. I hope to have a lot of years  left  in  me  to  see  what  is  yet  to come. I'll be right there to check it out, and  hopefully  my  Amiga  and  related systems will hang around long enough with  me  so  everyone  with  their  holographic brain-interface will ask me why I'm bothering with the strange dinosaur computers  that  you  have  to  touch  to operate.

## Amiga OS 3.1.4

The  new,  cleaned-up,  polished  Amiga operating system for your 68K machine fixes all the small annoyances that have piled  up  over  the  years.  Originally  intended as a bug-fix release, it also modernizes many system components previously upgraded in OS 3.9.

Contrary to its modest revision number, AmigaOS  3.1.4  is  arguably  as  large  an upgrade as OS 3.9 was, and surpasses it in stability and robustness. Over 320K of release notes cover almost every aspect of your favourite classic  AmigaOS-from bootmenu to datatypes.

Some highlights:

- Over  20  Kickstart  ROM  modules and many more disk-based core OS components  were  fixed,  updated, or added.
