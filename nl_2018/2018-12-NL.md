## Buying an Amiga 30 Years Later

When  I  was  younger  we  had  an Atari ST as our home computer, and while it was a great machine and I loved it dearly, I always found a lot of the games weren't quite as good as  on  the  Amiga  that  a  lot  of  my friends had.

I routinely used to go to my friend's house, and we'd play for hours on the latest Amiga games. I'm guessing  this  was  the  mid  to  late  80's. That's around 30 years ago. Yikes!

A few months ago I watched "From Bedroom  to  Billions."  It  triggered some serious nostalgia and a lot of memories  came  flooding  back.  So on  a  whim,  I  decided  to  see  if  I could pick-up an Amiga on eBay to replay  some  of  those  old  games that I loved as a child.

It turns out it's not too hard. There's a thriving community that still uses and loves the Amiga. There's also a fair number of people on  eBay  who  refurbish  and  upgrade  them  with  a  4GB  memory card  containing  workbench  and  a bunch of software and games. This is very handy because, even if you did  manage  to  buy  the  original games,  there's  no  guarantee  they will work due to the magnetic platters  getting  mouldy  or  damaged over  the  last  30  years.  Yes,  that's real life bit rot in action.

Buying  "Vintage"  Amiga  Hardware

## MCCC News 0

## December 2018

Ah  eBay,  I'm  not  sure  where  else you  could  easily  find  vintage  and retro tech with such ease. I picked up the following for under £650, it may  sound  like  a  fair  amount  of money  for  30-year-old  hardware and  I  suppose  it  is.  However,  because  it's  now  "vintage,"  it'll  hold it's value (or go up). I don't plan on keeping it forever, but it's good to know I'll be able to get my money back once I've enjoyed that sweet hit of nostalgia.

## Amiga Problems

I picked up the 1084s monitor, and on first boot, it looked good, I was impressed it was still working after all these years. However, a few minutes later I noticed a high-pitched whine. Uh-oh, I knew this was not a good  sign.  A  little  bit  of  Googling and I found out that this is usually a  problem  with  the  flyback,  and while  I'm  technical  and  can  build PC's this is way outside my comfort zone - especially when you consider  these  old  CRT's  are  known  for storing up a lot of electricity inside them.

The whine goes away after it's been on  for  20  minutes,  but  the  issue does  mean  the  monitor  probably has limited life left in it unless it's fixed. I plan to sell the monitor back on eBay at some point, so hopefully, someone that can fix the issue will pick it up.

I  got  the  machine  up  and  running, and  the  first  few  games  I  tried looked  glorious  on  the  old  CRT monitor. I was delighted, however,

I  then  tied  to  launch  Cannon  Fodder, Syndicate, Monkey Island, and a few others and each one greeted me with the following error "Can't Allocate ShadowMem." Urgh.

After some more Googling, it turns out because the games are not running from floppy disks the machine needs to load them into RAM and run  them  from  there.  Along  with running Workbench, this can quickly munch through the 2MB of RAM that the A1200 has installed.

Again,  I  turned  to  eBay  and  found an  8MB  RAM  upgrade.  I  installed this via the trapdoor in the bottom of the Amiga. I was pleasantly surprised  to  find  it  took  less  than  5 minutes to install. I never thought I'd see myself buying RAM and upgrading  30-year-old  hardware  in 2018, but here we are.

If you really want to push the boat out, you can try and get your hands on  an  accelerator,  something  like the  Blizzard  or  Apollo  -  these have  up  to  128Mb  RAM  and  a 68030 or 68040 Processor and offer  a  blistering  performance  enhancement. I decided not to go this route as they can be somewhat pricey.

Once the extra RAM was installed every  single  game  I  tried  worked like a charm. I had finally reached retro nirvana. I had a perfect Amiga setup,  it  looked  and  worked  just like  it  would  have  all  those  years ago.

Personal Top 20 Amiga Games

I'd forgotten how many of the best games  I'd  played  as  a  child  were actually  on  the  Amiga,  as  I  dug deeper I kept finding classics that I'd forgotten about. The vast breadth  and  depth  of  the  Amiga games  library  is  seriously  impressive.

While we've come a long way in 30 years, some of the games don't hold up as well as I remember. Thankfully, there are a bunch of games that still look good, sound great, and are fun  to  play.  Some  of  them  could even give modern games a run for their money.

In no particular order, here are my personal  top  20  favourite  Amiga games:

- Lemmings
- The NewZealand Story
- Bomb Jack
- Bubble Bobble
- Rainbow Island
- R-Type
- Worms
- The Secret of Monkey Island
- Rick Dangerous
- The Chaos Engine
- Dungeon Master
- Gods
- Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh
- Chuck Rock
- MouseTrap
- Batman The Movie
- King's Quest I
- IK+
- Goldrunner
- Dogs of War

The  other  game  I  loved  from  this era  was "Solomon's Key." Unfortunately, it was one of the few games that was only on the Atari ST and never  made  its  way  to  the  Amiga. Here's  a  list  of  games  that  didn't make my top 20 but are still worth mentioning:

Another World, Xenon, Space Quest, Magic  Pockets,  Syndicate,  Cannon Fodder, Adventure Island Dizzy, Supercars,  Pushover,  Stuntcar  Racer, Populous I &amp; II, Speedball II, Simon the Sorcerer, Fire and Ice, Kid Chaos, Ballistix, Xenon &amp; Xenon 2, Benefactor,  Oscar,  PP  Hammer,  Ruff  'n' Tumble, Soccer Kid, Yo! Joe, Traps n Treasure, Mr. Nutz, Jim Power, Turrican 2,  Lost  Vikings,  Superfrog, Putty,  Wonder  Dog,  Walker,  Settlers,  Kult,  Oids,  Flood,  and  Super Methane Bros.

## Vintage Amiga Hardware Photos

There seems to be a lack of recent Amiga  photos  out  there  (not  surprising really), and because I enjoy photography  (and  I'm  a  geek),  I thought I'd spend some time taking a few photos. I've tried to give the images a slight retro/vintage feel to them without going over the top.

## Final Thoughts

The  Amiga  still  has  an  active  and faithful community, and it's thanks to them that it's possible to pick up an Amiga and get it upgraded and running all these years later. I also think it's a testament to how impor-

tant the machine was in the UK and around Europe.

If  you're  looking  to  learn  more about the booming home-brew game  scene  during  80's Britain then I can highly recommend "From Bedroom to Billions' (http://www.frombedroomstobilli ons.com/).  It's  a  little  low  budget but seems to capture the time perfectly.

The follow-up documentary, "From Bedroom  to  Billions:  the  Amiga Years' (same web address) is also a must watch if you have fond memories of the Amiga. There's also "Viva Amiga," (http://amigafilm.com/) but I've not watched that one, yet!
