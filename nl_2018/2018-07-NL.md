## 'Free' Software &amp; Vampire Info

Welcome to another month, another  meeting  (usual  time  and  place, check  the  front  page  if  you  don't know  what  that  is.),  and  another mass  or rambling ranting  from yours truly.

This  particular  ramble  was  kicked off when I received notice that my go-to  application  for  graphics  and drawing  on  my  tablet,  Autodesk Sketchbook, was now free, as long as you set up an account with the company, 'graciously' allowing me to continue using the program without an active account for a number of  days  before  usefulness  is  (presumably) cut off. First off, this was a  little  annoying  to  me  because  I was one of those people who paid actual money to have a full working version  of  the  program  on  my tablet(s),  only  for  the  ownership paradigm to be swapped out before me. I  don't  have  much  experience yet  with  this  new  'free'  Sketchbook, so I can't say for certain what to  expect,  but  I  do  have  plenty  of experience  with  other  ostensibly free  applications  of  various  types, which is why I'm concerned about the change. Will I be able to use my graphics  software  freely? Will I have to endure interruptions as advertisements  are  put  between  me and my work? Will my account information guarantee additional spam and targeted marketing headed my way? Does the need for an account  mean  the  program  won't run  if  it  can't  'check  in'  with  its

home base, thus being useless anywhere I don't have a wireless internet  connection?  I  don't  know  the answers to any of these questions yet, but I'm sure I will find out soon enough, and I have my doubts I'll be happy with the answers.

It's all part of an ongoing campaign to remove the concept of user ownership from software. As an Amiga user, I remember the good old days when you owned the software you bought in a relatively unambiguous way.  Part  of  this  comes  from  the software usually being sold only on physical media such as floppy discs and  later  CD-ROM  (or  tapes,  or ROM cartridges  depending  on  the platform.). As the buyer/owner, you pretty much had the legal right to do whatever you wanted with it, including  making  personal  copies and  modifications,  as  long  as  you weren't distributing or reselling them  and  messing  with  the  software creators' business (even though a draconian user agreement might say otherwise).

In  this  age  of  digital  distribution and constant connectivity, the balance  has  shifted  far  more  toward the  software  publishers,  and  the idea  of  buying  a  game  or  application  is  more  akin  to  licensing  or renting  it.  It's  easier  for  them  to enforce any restrictions they want to place on something when the net lets  the  program  converse  with some  distant home  server,  and snitch that you might be using it on too many different machines, or using an unofficial (pirated) copy, or in  some  other  way  not  fully  sanc-

tioned by the publisher, regardless of what money you may have spent to  gain  access  to  that  software  in the  first  place.  Perhaps  they  don't ask you for money at all, at least not a  first,  instead  using  the  game  or app as  a  vector  to  target  advertising at your head. Perhaps they use the  free  stuff  to  hook  end  users, then  offer  further  enhancements for  money  as  the  free  part  of  the experience grows more tedious. Perhaps  the  publisher  eventually decides to stop supporting that particular  piece  of  software,  or  anything at all because they went out of  business  themselves,  and  suddenly  your  app  doesn't  work  because  it's  looking  for  some  home server  that  isn't  there  any  more. Perhaps I don't really need to worry  about  those  things  with  my Sketchbook program, but historically, switching from 'thing you bought' to  'free  thing  if  you  have an  account  with  us'  rarely  comes without strings.

As I am the resident club member with a Vampire accelerator for my Amiga,  I  was  asked  to  relay  some information regarding the current availability  of  Vampire  hardware. This  was  not  quite  as  simple  as  I was hoping, but here is some of info on the current state of the Vampire Amiga hardware family.

Currently available hardware:

- Vampire 600 V2 Card plugs on over Amiga 600 surface-mount  68000  chip.  Offers HDMI video output for enhanced graphic modes, 128 Mb
- RAM, and storage via micro-SD card slot.
- Vampire 500 V2+

Card    plugs  into  68000  chip socket on Amiga 500 (and has successfully been used on other models  with  the  same  socket, such as A2000 series or A1000). Offers the features of the V600, and adds an IDE interface and a 'user  port,'  which  allows  extra interface hardware to be added, such as network or USB.

Planned upcoming hardware:

- Vampire V4 series

Uses  newer  Cyclone  5  FPGA chip for greater speed and capabilities than V2 series (presumably), 512 Mb DDR3 RAM, fastIDE,  digital  video  out,  MicroSD, dual kickstart flashROMs,  and  a  modular  design philosophy for easier adapting to different systems.

Versions of the hardware are planned for the Amiga 500/1000/2000/CDTV, Amiga 600 (adapter for the A500 board), Amiga 1200, and a stand alone version which requires no Amiga hardware for plugs/interfaces/power.

Current availability:

Stock fluctuates, but as of this writing:

- www.amedia-computer.com (France)  V500  V2+,  V600  V2,
- each @ 379 Euro. V600 in stock as of this writing.
- Amigastore.eu (Spain) V500 V2+ listed @ 370 Euro, not currently in stock.
- www.relec.ch V500 V2+ @ 390 Swiss  Francs,  V600  V2  @  300 Francs, low stocks.
- Amigakit.amiga.store (UK) Listed  as  a  reseller,  but  Vampire boards  not  found  on  the  site currently.

For  more  up-to-date  information, visit the www.apollo-core.com site.

Also,  you  can  visit  the  sister  site www.apollo-accelerators.com, where you can put in your contact info,  and  receive  word  and  payment  request  once  hardware  is available (usually via PayPal). Currently only the V500 V2+ is listed as available on the site, at the price of 300 Euro.

Based  on  my  brief  amount  of  research, there are still  hoops  to jump  through  if  you  want  to  lay your hands on a new Vampire card, but  the  overall  convenience  and number of available purchasing options  is  far  greater  than  when  I tried  to  do  so  over  two  years  ago. Good  luck  to  anyone  who  might want  to  make  the  attempt  in  the future.

## Worthy

Just because a system becomes obsolete for most of us doesn't mean that  everyone  stops  working  with them. Take a look at this brand new game for the Amiga 500 called Worthy, which is sure to make most of us regret ever upgrading our home computers,  despite  the  improvements made since 1987.

The group who developed the game is  known  as  Pixelglass  and  they have done a lot of work on this platform, releasing several games over the  past  few  years.  Their  latest  is Worthy, an action-adventure game that looks similar to the top-down perspective Zelda games from the SNES.  It's  an  impressive  piece  of work  for  a  system  that  few  of  us own anymore, but if you have one (or even if you have a good emulator)  you  might  want  to  give  it  a whirl.
