## The CMI Processor Accelerator for the Amiga A Review by Johnny Kitchens Mid-Cities Commodore Club

It seems that since the creation of the Amiga everyone has tried to speed up its operation in some way. The result has been the installation of 68010 cpu, 6802) cpu, and the 55030 cpu. Each of these have offered advantages and disadrantages Increased speed on the plus side and incompatibilities on the negative side seem to be mentioned equelly. Another complaint, especially about the 68020 and 68030, is price Their cost alone could double the price of your computer. All of this was enough for me to keep my original 69000 in place until now.

Creative Microsystem, Inc. has introduced an accelerator board which offered most of the positive advantages of other cpu changes with none of the disadvantages, They accomplished this feat by utilizing a 16 mhz 68000 mounted on a board which allows you to set the cous frequency to i. Ib mhz or 14 Se mhz This gives a but reduction in the cpus command execution time. The circuitry on the board allows the Amiga to operate as if the original cpu is still in place. You can switch between the two frequencies by using a software switch provided by

All of this peaked my interest and I bought one At less than f150 it certainly beats the prices of othe cpu enhancements. Upon opening the box I found very well written instruction booklet It even shows all the screws that have to be removed. There was also a card that gives a 800 number where you can order a 68881 and a crystal for the board. mounting a bobol math chip on your board you get an even better increase in pertormance. Inis was getting better all the time!

Installation appeared to be easy, but I would soon learn not easy enough. The original cou came out much easier than I had heard. The new cpu went in easy enough I thought, but after reassembly the computer did not work. I took it apart ağain discovered that one pin was not seated I straightened the pin and tried again without putting the case together. It worked and I reassembled it again. When I turned the power on nothing happened. Unce again! had go through the motions of disassembly and reassembly, yute trying, but tinally - success.

everything ced think a lot ed terene I noticed very little change in performance in most operations. One thing I had noticed in the past was that after opening many windows and using the program Dropshadow, screen refresh seemed to take forever. With the new cou the speed increase was very noticeable. I could open more windows before I slowed back to the original Performance out d the atas disk tole that ditterence it showed. The new cou appears to be more actve than the old Switching between cou speeds showed a very noticeable difference in activity. PM shows that the cpu is doing a lot during it's time of activity, but is higher up on the scale just slightly showing it is more idle. I decided to load the computer down with multitasking. Using 7. 16 mhz I started several programs until the PM showed the cou was working constantly. I switched to 14. 32 mhz and Immediately got an indication ot a more idle cpu. At least I now had proof that the cou was faster.

After extensive testing I finally found &amp; program it wouldn't run. On Marauder Il is a demo called ArkDemo. It will not run using either speed. On the disk provided with Accelerator they have set up a file to list hardware and software incompatibilities.

## CMI Processor Accelerator Continued From Page 1

Certain guru in the past now have a new problem. cannot be reset with CiRL-Amiga-Amiga So far this has been only an infrequent problem, but a problem none the less.

Would I recommend this to anyone? Yes. to those who are interested in technically improving their computer and to whom any increase in speed is desirable It also adds the convenience of allowing installation of the 68881 math chip, which will be really appreciated after 1 3 is on the market. I would not recommend it to anyone expecting to see dazzling speed changes in the Amiga. The Amigas' use of special chips to perform specitic functions means the cou has less to do Anything relying on the cou will be sped up by the accelerator, but there is a lot that won't Math and graphic intensive operations will perform at up to 40% faster at the higher clock rate

## METCOM*88 A Report?

This newsletter should logically hold a report on METCOM*98, the Mid-Cities Commodore Club's biggest event of the year. The event became history last month, but unfortunately, this issue will go to the printer one week before it occurs This makes s critique rather difficult. The only thing that can be ahead of time is that it was a great success. Thanks go to all the people who worked so hard over so many months. Its not easy to pull off an event of this magnatude. Take the time to thank them personally for their efforts More next month

## LaserXPress for Amiga An Overview by John Rydell Reprinted From Amy Today

Since early in 1987, C Ltd. has been working on adapting the newest technology in desk-top publishing/small office automation hardware (including small local area networks, laser printers, page scanners and facsimile transmission devices) for use with the various models of Commodore Amiga Computers

While IBM and Apple were adding band-aids to outdated designs, trying to circumvent some of their limitations, Commodore started selling a new computer system, the Commodore Amiga, which was designed from the very beginning to take advantage of the technological advoncements that had been made, Though not specifically designed to directly drive a laser engine, the Amiga computer is ideally suited to do so with the ability to directly address over y megabytes of memory for storage of information. The Hmiga also came with several very tast methods o sending the information to external devices such as thi laser engine. The Amiga computer. because of its outstanding video graphics display, is also ideally suiter to host desk top publishing sottware, which le currently the tastest growing use for laser printers li the business market. Building on the basic strengths ol the Amiga, C Ltd. developed the LaserXPress as à laser printer that truly works in concert with, rather than in spite of, the computer to which it is attached.

In addition to excellent print quality, the LaserXPress is able to print a complete page of 300 DPI text and/or graphics information 3 to 72 times faster then any other laser printer available for the Amiga.

In summary, the Laserxpress printer uses new technologies in both hardware and software design that allow it to out perform ANt laser printer connected to ANY small business or personal computer. No other system allows full 300 DPI editing of the exact bit-map seconds! Priced at under $2500, the Laserxpress combined with Publishing Partner Protessional, Express Paint, and the huge volume of fonts (all of which gre provided at no cost provides a complete fast powertul yet economical solution for even the most demanding high-productivity desk-top publishing environments

## What's New At Babbages Software Review By Cheryl Howard Mid-Cities Commodore Club

For all you garne show enthusiasts, Share Data has a supply of computer versions of the popular television game shows on the market. Most of them have been on the shelves for quite some time, and now the Second Edition versions are on the shelves. Two of these Second Edition series are Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy. Both games are authentic to the shows which they emwate with Jeopardy being the most educational and most like trivia. COMPUTER JEOPARDY is fast paced and can be played by one to three players. If you select a one player game, the computer will select your opponents. You can select a three player game and make up opponents as well, as this is what my daughter and her friends do After entered into the Champions List along with the total earnings and character representation to be saved to the disk. This allows the winner to return at a later date as Returning Champion to challenge new contestants and to increase their total earnings. You do not have to have a data disk to store on because only the highest winners are left on the list. · The lowest scores are erased to make room for higher scores. Both the original version and the Second Edition are played exactly the same. The Second baition is just a new set of categories. I highly recommend this game is both entertaining and educational. Both versions are priced at $1L00.

For those of you who, like myself, enjoy the

all contestants are selected, a game board with six categories is shown From here on responses to the game are given using the keyboard. Numeric keys select the category, the amount of the wager and the "Who, What, When and Where" type questions that must proceed your answer. (Remember, in Jeopardy, all answers MUST be in the form of a question) Then you type in your answer, using the delete key to correct spelling errors One word of caution - the game will allow for some spelling errors but your answer must be pretty darn close or you will get the wrong answer even though your only mistake was not knowing now to spell some foreign name. The game is played exactly like the television version with the Commodore key, the space bar, and the F7 key being used by the contestants to "buzz in Correct answers add money to your score, incorrect answers deduct. There are the usual Daily Doubles and Double Jeopardy included on the disk for a complete version of Jeopardy. I like the feature of the game that allows the champion's name to be

Sprint Cycling Hurdles, Pole Vault, Hammer-throw, Uneven Parallel Bars, Rings, Archery and Springboard Diving. The graphic representations of Olympic Park are beautiful and true to the actual site This version offers first-person views of the events, fantastic television angles, 3-D scrolling and of course, sound effects. The new gimmick this time is a Coaches book that is supposed to boost your scores. Unfortunately the game does not include the team sports, boxing or weight lifting. Maybe if they did, we could take out some of our frustrations over the scoring controversies that arose in the real games. After all, no ones feelings will be hurt at the computer. Game play is controlled by the joystick, as in earlier versions and

Olympic games, Epyx has released the latest in their programs simulating the Games of the Olympiad. THE GAMES, priced at $3196, is an authentic representation of the Summer Olympics at Seoul, Korea. Each time Epyx comes out with their version of the Olympic games, something new is added. THE GAMES features eight events: Velodrome

the game is worth the money if you collect these games.

Another popular game show to hit the computer circuit is WIN, LOSE OR DRAW. This version, put out by Hi Tech Expressions, is cute and fun to play. Of course you lose some of the enjoyment of the show since you don't have a live audience. The live payers at this house seem to get embarrassed if too much emotion is shown during game play. When the program is booted up, you are asked for the number of players and if a one player version is chosen you play against the computer. This version of game play is slower than if you make up a second player and play both sides. You are then give a choice of whether to be a male or female and also a choice of people to appear on the screen as your contestant which you then give a name. From here on the game is played strictly using the alphabetic keys. The computer will generate a hand drawn clue and your job is to type in guesses to what is being drawn. As you give a correct answer, that part of the answer is put on the 'drawing pad for reference The puzzle may be ANYTHING so keep an open mind. No clues are given as to what the phrase might be, you just have to assume it could be anything and start guessing I you miss the answer, your opponent is given a chance to guess. After each member of each team draws, then the Speed Round is played The winner with the highest score wins and goes on the Champions list to compete again. This is a good entertaining game for those of you who are not adyenture seekers. Priced around $l

For those of you familiar with MANIAC MANSION, this new game by Lucasfilm Games is just for you ZAK MCKRACKEN AND THE ALIEN MINDBENDERS is played exactly the same way. Joystick controlled, you have the necessary commands right on screen with you at all times Zak is a reporter for a sleazy tabloid and things right now are kinda slow around the newspaper. Aliens from outer space have started a world wide stupidity epidemic and the phone lines have been identified as the way the epidemic bas spread. Zak's job is to find the true story about the epidemic. This is one of those games that I could continue describing, but because it is a comedy thriller, to do so would take away some of the enjoyment. Let's just say l enjoyed playing it and it is well worth the price of $3820. Since I am not generally a game player, that says a lot.

## Telecommunication Protocols

## A Primer by Ron Skinner Reprinted From Amy Today

Let's begin with a couple of essential definitions. Baud, named for a fellow named Baudot, means, for our purposes, "bits per second." It really means something different, but this will serve as a working definition. The other required word is byte. There are eight bits of information contained in a byte. That is, a byte is simply a group of eight specific bits. Within a set of eight bits there are 256(2-to-the-8th) permutations possible, ranging from all zeroes to all ones. Each letter in the alphabet, every digit, and all other special characters are represented by a predetermined pattern of these eight bits. For example, a capital letter has a different pattern than its lower case counterpart. Obviously, only half of the total patterns available are necessary to represent text. This allows the remaining 128 to be used for other purposes.

Now that the preliminaries are out of the way, let's look beyond the "smoke and mirrors" that seem to obscure the understanding of protocols and telecommunications in general.

To communicate successfully, computers must be similarly configured. Each must be set for the same data transfer frequency or boud rate. Because computer data transfer is, by definition, a binary process, some method of translating the telephone's analog system to a usable digital format is required. This is the purpose of the modem. The term ", "modem" is an acronym derived from "modulate/demodulate". Its primary function is the digital/analog/digital conversion process that allows the magic to happen.

For the sake of reliability, we must do more than pour a stream of modulated binary information in one end of a copper wire, and then demodulate it at the other end. We're all familiar with that nemesis of telecomputing: line noise. Without some system of controlling and verifying the ensuing torrent of bits, the task of deciphering the stream would be insurmountable. Often absolute data integrity isn't critical. For example, noise bursts in text transmissions are readily identifiable. But even here, in this simplest of exchanges, there is more to the process than you may think. Remember that 128 permutations are enough to cover text requirements with room to spare. Seven bits are required to give us these 128 variations. However, a byte is eight bits long. This presents possibilities. In ASCIl (Americon Standard Code for Information Interchange) transmissions, the first seven of these bits represent data. And the eighth bit represents a form of insurance that the first seven were received as 'sent. This is "parity checking." A convention is established between the sender and receiver requiring that each byte be composed of an even or odd number of The eighth bit is used for this purpose at the sending end. Should the receiving end get a byte that has odd parity (an odd number of ls) when even parity has been agreed on, it knows that the byte contains an error. This system, despite its relative simplicity is sufficient for most text transmissions.

Program files, data files, and archived text files use all eight bits in every byte lo represent information. This requires a somewhat different approach to parity checking. All protocols other than ASC require that we add either one or two full bytes to the end of o "block" of bytes. A block is usually fixed at 128 bytes in length. The purpose of the added one or two bytes is to contain a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CAC) character or word. Like parity, the CAC is constructed of the sending end as o pattern of bits to verify that the preceding block has been received accurately. The receiving end dynamically creates its own CRC from the information received and compares it to the CBC pattern from the sender. Any variation requires that the block be present. This is done by transmitting to the sender o "Negative Acknowledge" (NAK). If it was correctly received, an "Acknowledge" (ACK) is returned and the next block is sent

Let's return for a moment to the idea of baud. 2400 baud, modems are able to send and receive 2400 bits per second. Although there are eight bits per byte, 2400 baud does not translate into 300 bytes per second Unfortunately, a byte must be preceded with o "start" bit and ended with a "stop" bit (sometimes two at lom baud rates). Ten bits are therefore required to transfer each byte at 2400 baud, reducing the maximum rate to 240 characters per second (cps). But the reduction does not stop here. In most protocols, an additional one or two bytes of CAC data are added for each 128 bytes of information. Contributing to this slowing process is the time required for the ACK or MAK cycle. This lost time is referred to as "overhead," and frequently results in the loss of several cps.

One method of reducing overhead is to eliminate the ACK, MAK response wait. Newer protocols do not wait. They assume that a transmission will be successful and immediately send the next block Telephone lines accept simultaneous two-way traffic (full duplex) so, while sending the next block, the sender is listening for the ACK or NAK for the previous block. If all goes well, there is o performance gain. If not, the software must decide which block (or blocks) have to be re-transmitted. This process, while being more efficient in a noise-free environment, creates still more overhead in the form of an additional

byte called the packet number. The packet number allows the faulty blocks to be identified for rebroadcast

This brings us finally to the main thrust: protocols First we must deal with ASCI. ASCIl's use is restricted solely to uncompressed text. This, plus its poor control, make it unacceptable for anything other than the transfer of raw text data such as mail and short text files. Most newcomers to communications make the mistake of attempting to transmit binary files in ASCIl at one time or another. Much of the available terminal software allows this to be attempted. Often the transmission will appear normal, but, due to the formatting, the outcome is invariably garbage.

Another common and broadly used protocol is ModemCRC. This is exactly the same as Xlodem except that it uses two CAC charocters. The result is that effective performance is insignificantly reduced while reliability is increased to about 9968. Obviously, when confronted with a choice between the two, always opt for Modem-ChiC.

The most frequently used protocol is XModem. This standard is both reliable and widely available. Blocks of 128 bytes are used and one CRC character is added to the end of each block. Accuracy is 96% owing to its reliance on only one CRC bit.

Next up is Kermit. · Kermit is a compromise protocol included in some terminal software to allow communication with mini or mainframe systems that demand it. Most PC users have little reason to use it and few will ever encounter it. It uses 128 byte blocks and includes heavy overhead such as "header block," etc. It has the same accuracy as XModem-CAC, but it is slow. This is the option of "last resort."

This brings us to YModem. This protocol differs from those above in that it sends "super blocks" of one kilobyte (eight blocks of 128 bytes each) followed by a two byte CRC word. As a result it is the fastest protocol for micro computers using non-self-correcting modems above 2400 baud. There are two times when this protocol should not be used: when lines are unusually noisy (the failure of a single bit requires the re-transmission on all 1,026 bytes); or in an environment such as PC Pursuit involving long hand shaking delays. There are other considerations with Modem. For example, Modem pads (adds lo) a block until it is exactly 1024 bytes even though the last record may contain only a few bytes of data. If the file being transmitted is 1025 bytes long it will be sent as two blocks of 1024 bytes each Remember - each YModem block contains 1024 bytes of data plus two bytes of CRC. The second block will consist of one byte of data and 1023 bytes of podding composed of end-of-file marks. The receiver does not automatically strip this padding: Therefore, that 1025 byte file is now 2049 bytes. One excellent feature of Modem is its ability to revert automatically to 128 byte blocks. If six errors are detected during the transmission of a file, it will assume the cause to be line interference and immediately switch to the smaller blocks. This increases the likelihood that the transmission will be completed and improves efficiency dramatically,

On the immediate horizon are far more capable protocols, many of which are already at work on older, better supported systems. The next step from Amigo software developers will likely be the inclusion of windowing protocols such as hillodem This uses a process called "windowing," hence the "W" Like XModem, it uses 128 byte blocks but does not wait for a response between blocks. WModem tries to stay four blocks ahead of the receiver while, as in the "Roadrunner" cartoons, the receiver plays the part of the coyote. The difference between the block being sent and the most recent ACK or MAK is the window. WXModem is currently the protocol of choice for packet switching applications and should serve well until baud rates beyond 2400 become commonplace. Then it will be on to something like MegaLink which is capable of more than 98% efficiency at 9600 baud. Unbelievable though it may seem, there are systems in the offing capable of surpassing 100f of their rated efficiency.

This brings us to Zlodem, one of the newer protocols. ZModem was designed for use in a PC Pursuit-like environment. There is a significant difference between ZModem and the other protocols we have already discussed. Instead of being start-stop in nature, it is a streaming protocol. A streaming protocol does not look for ACK signals from the receiver until the transfer is successfully completed. If an error occurs, it is up to the sender to insure that it can recover the faulty data--no small task, considering it is not buffered. Elodem simply continues transmitting, assuming all is well until it receives a NAK or finishes. This means it should be faster than even the windowing protocols which we will discuss next. However, while Zlodem does not wait for ACKs, relatively slow as originally configured. One reason for this is its use of un-buffered blocks of 250 bytes each, requiring continuous file access. If buffers had been used there could be a large group of blocks in memory awaiting transmission. This obvious limitation has led to hack solutions and ZModem is becoming increasingly nonstandard. This shouldn't present problems as long as the transfers are between similarly configured machines-Amiga to Amiga, for example. However, not all Modem protocols in use today are created equal I, and this may be a consideration when communicating between the fimiga and other (ahem, lesser) systems. Nonetheless, it is a popular protocol because of its speed on the packet switching networks. But because it's not network-friendly (doesn' recognize their Xün-XOff requirements and consequently appears hoggish) its future is becoming increasingly cloudy, particularly as the networks get ever more congested

## The Hewlett Packard PaintJet

## A Review by Dan Bonachea Reprinted From Tuna

Our beloved Amiga is blessed with outstanding graphics capability dont need to tell you that, you already know it Unfortunately, until recently, Ami was cursed in one respect the printed page. Oh, you can pick up any old near-letter quality printer and print very nice hardcopy of text, and some decent gray-scale pictures, even some fairly good 24-pin dotmatrix color output But they just dont seem to have quite the grab that Amis monitor has. This has been one of my few dislikes about my system Graphic output simply was NOT up to par! Enter the Hewlett Packard PaintJet.

The PaintJet is an ink-jet printer which combines 4 colors, cyan, yellow, magenta, and black, to perform its magic. The ink comes in two cartridges, one for black ink, and one for the three-color ink. The black ink cartridge has an approximate life expectancy of approximately 1,100 pages, based on 1000 characters per page (at this point I was getting excited about the prospects of filling my house with every picture / have come across Then I read on..) The color cartridge, unfortunately, requires a higher per-page ink density, so one can expect only about 180 pages of color graphics. BIG let-down This unfortunate sideaffect makes the price-per-page go up as well

Set-up is easy. The PaintJet (supposedly) comes in three versions, parallel, serial and HPIB (IEEE-408). I can only assume that the serial and HPIB interfaces are a special order, because mine came with a parallel interface and nothing more. · The power supply is separate from the printer, ala the Commodore 64. When I first plugged the power supply in after setting up the printer, I got one of the biggest surprises Ive had in quite some time the printer goes through a sort of power-on/off routine, meaning that the power comes on for about half a second then goes right back off (I am still a little leery of this function, but I have heard of no failures caused by this, so I cross my fingers and hope! Once connected to the Amiga's parallel port and powered on, you are raring to go. Simply open up preferences, go to the printer select screen, scan through the printers available, and select select hmmm there doesn't seem to be a choice

for the PaintJet listed bere. That's right, unless you have the AmigaDOS 13 printer drivers, printerdevice and preferences, youll be barking up the wrong tree. If you don't have them, all I can say is to get them. Numerous software packages are out which have the 13 printer stuff on the disk, such as Prowrite 20 or Shakespeare, or perhaps you might find some friendly dealer or maybe someone from your user group.

Now for the nitty-gritty. As I said (contrary to popular belief), the printer will accept any 85 x 11 inch piece of paper, within reason (weight-wise) There IS special paper made for the printer, a claycoated paper which HP says is specially vacuumed to reduce dust, the number one enemy of ink-jet printers. I highly recommend using it, though not for HP's reasons The clay-coated paper is specially made to work with the ink in the cartridges so that it will spread the ink together somewhat, blending the colors

Some specifications print rate is a respectable 167 characters per second at 10 characters per inch, 200 cps at I2 cpi, and 300 cps at 18 cpi (You read that right. Most dot-matrix printers slow down as their characters get smaller, but the Paintdet gets fasteri Line length is 80 chars at 10 cpi, 96 chars at 12 cpi, and 144 chars at I8 cpi. Two font sets are built in, Courier 12 pt, and Letter Gothic 12 pt. and 8 pt (is that really THREE font sets? Arguable) Text printing can be uni- or bi-directional, color printing is unidirectional only, and transparencies can be printed upon (this, by the way, uses a larger amount of ink and the transparencies are NOT cheap) The printer will accept any 85 x Il inch piece of paper (more on this later). Maximum density is 180 dots per inch, both horizontal and vertical. dot size is 0.0085 inch (That's 85 THOUSANDTHS of an inch) The printer comes with an 8K buffer installed, which is reduced proportionally in size if downloadable fonts are used. The physical size of the printer is 1189 x 1740 x 3.86 inches and weighs Il pounds.

for a much more pleasing result than you will get with regular copier or typing paper it also tends to dry much faster. How is output? Excellent I have compared the output with the screen display, and all the colors are there, even in HAM mode. In fact, unless you want to buy a VERY high-end printer (minimum $5000), I don't see how you can do better. Yes, there is always the Xerox 4020 color ink-jet printer, and I must admit the output from that printer is excellent also In fact, you cant go wrong with either printer, except for one fact To clean the nozzles on the 4020, you need to get a cleaning fluid kit, which is not cheap. To clean the nozzles on the PaintJet, you need only wipe them with a supplied brush and plain WATER! Of course, you could also simply change the print cartriage. Oh! Did I forget to mention that the nozzles on the PaintJet are IN THE

CARTRIDGE? EVERY time you change cartridges, you change print nozzles. HP does this with all their inkjet printers, and I think it is a very good idea, considering the alternative.

Let's get down to facts. Do I recommend the PaintJet? Just like any other computer-related hardware question, the answer depends on what you want to do with it If your output has nothing to do with graphics of any sort, I would most certainly recommend against it. The cost of the cartridges is prohibitive, and there are dot-matrix printers available which can do a fine job for text-bosed printing. But if you have a need or desire for color output, I can see nothing in its price range which is as easy to use or has as nice a printed page as the PaintJet.

Bravo, HP!

## Amiga By-The-Loop

Brent Wood

Several things are happening right here at the end of the year. Lots of new programs are coming out and everyone is gearing up for the holidays. Despite all the activity, we had an excellent turnout at the October meeting.

At least thirty-five people enjoyed Rick Bilyea's presentation on home accounting packages. Rick made budgets about as entertaining 8S anyone could while demonstrating "Money Mentor" and "Phasar". (If we could just get a big screen to show these demos on!) And right at the door as you came in was a preview of "Dragon's Lair". OUR dealer support is VERY good. Thanks, Rick

And in this election year we have our yearly elections. The next two meetings are yery important to the future of the club and all members are encouraged to attend and vote for your choice for club and chapter officers. We need your input.

The next meeting "by the loop" falls on election day, Tuesday, November 8 The polls will be closed before we start, so while you're out, come on down for the meeting. Well start at 7:30 for g little after).

## Fort Worth Night Bill Jones

The Fort Worth Night Chapter met on October I7, at which time we discussed an invitation from the Fort Worth Day Chapter to merge our two groups. After some discussion it was agreed that the merger would strengthen both chapters and the FWNC accepted the invitation with the merger becoming effective at the first of 1989. The program for the meeting was a discussion and demonstration by Harold Williams of some of the Archive and Library software available in the club library. This was a very good presentation covering a utility which most of our chapter had not utilized. Next month our meeting will be November 21 at which time Jim Marshall will be giving a program about problems encountered when newing a disk.

## Arlington/Grand Prairie

Janet Hamm

Our September and October meetings provided very interesting and informative programs. In September, Keith Brown presented a judgement type program be designed in decision making. He gave a demo disk to our library for members to try out to see how useful it might be for them. Also, Glen Herring passed around a sample of a cartridge extender and contributed two demo disks to our Library of 64 and 128 versions of Write Stuff, a new word processing program. Classes and other bargains found available at the Budget Computer Store in Arlington and the Sears Surplus Store were brought to our attention.

In October, Cheryl Howard presented an updated version of GEOS using the GEOS ram expansion to demonstrate Geowrite, Geodex, Geocalc and Geofile. GEOS has pulldown menus for which you use a joystick or mouse for options. She also showed how to set your driver for a work disk and how to select and set up your printer. This is a very powerful and effective program.

Glen read the proposed MCCC slate of officers for the coming year. A nominating committee wil be selected at our next meeting with the election of new officers in December. Okley Moss is also scheduled for the November 15th meeting. He will be bringing us up to date on how to use the bulletin

## Fort Worth

## Mary Louise Hagemeyer

At our October meeting we had good attendance and a full agenda. First, we discussed the future of the chapter and of the whole club. Mext, we nominated the following chapter officers for 1989:

| President          | Bob Krause     |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Vice President     | Rich Meyer     |
| Treasurer          | John Sookma    |
| Secretary/Reporter | Ellen Triplett |
| Librarian          | Joe Ostrokol   |

Donald Tate demonstrated the General Ledger double-entry accounting program for the C6f. This is a versatile bookkeeping program that would be good for a small business, although it could be used for personal records, too. While it can operate with one disk drive, it goes better with two drives. It sends all results to the printer instead of to the screen, which might not please some users. Donald had developed a realistic example of a business application, and the printed output looked professional.

Jim Marshall reviewed the SID Utilities disk which was recently added to the club library. He didn't want to gaze at the picture of Elvis very long, but at least we learned that the program makes it possible to combine pictures and music.

For the BASIC lesson we looked at Jim Butterfield's little program that draws a can and moves it across the screen, and we demonstrated how to list a disk directory on the C64 screen without losing the current program.

Next month we will elect our chapter officers, and Herschel Gibbs will present an interesting program on computer music.

The meeting will be Saturday, Movember 12,at l:38 p.m. in the Southwest Regional Library on Hulen Street.

## Chapter News

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

Our October meeting featured a presentation by Rob Thompson of Computer Skills and Dave Munsie of Intercomputing. He were treated to a demonstration of Digiview 3.8. This is the latest and greatest revision of the original framegrabbing software/hardware package for the Amigo. They keep making it better! Thanks to both Rob and Dave for a very interesting demo. And it's nice to see these stores actively participating at our meetings.

Speaking of the next meeting, the next one will be held on hovember I?, at the Arlington Community Center. Don't forget to attend the Amiga Workshop on Hovember 15. Bring your computer and your problems and let the "experts" help.

Scott Lamb was kind enough to lead the question and answer/rumor portion of the program. Lots of activity in the Amiga world these days. For the latest information, attend the next meeting. He generally find out about things several months before they appear in the national magazines.
