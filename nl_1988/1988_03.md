## GET RICH! Cheryl Howard, MCCC

This FINANCIAL STRATEGIES program by Arrays, Inc./Continental Software is available in several sets or modules dealing with basic financial planning, real estate, and insurance planning. Each module is sold separately and Module 1-FINANCIAL STRATEGIES is available at Federated in Hurst.

A basic C=64 set-up is required with two disk drives being recommended, to cut down on the disk swapping time between the program disk and your data disk. A printer is nice, but optional. The program disk uses both sides of the disk, with the main menu, utility programs, demonstration program, printing programs and the forms on Side A. Side B contains the graphics programs and graphics data.

The program is completely menu-driven and supports most of the current printers on the market. The authors of GET RICH! advise the user to study both the program guide and the financial strategies booklet that come with the program, which contains a number of worksheets to help you organize you assets, investments, and liabilities to help you set goals and determine both your net worth and discretionary income. The CALCULATIONS part of the program Will allow you to solve problems involving money, time, and interest. When you have completed all this, the GRAPHS will help you easily analyze the performance of your money over a given period of time. Finally, you have the option to print out various forms and graphs containing the information you have entered into the program. This option allows you to print one form at a time, all the forms at the same time, as well as printing itemizations.

Unfortunately, I did not have sufficient time to spend with this program due to previous commitments, however, after reading the enclosed booklets and viewing the demonstration program, l was impressed with the program as a whole. Serious financial planning can be successfully done with this program if you utilize the suggestions and take the time to gather your information needed to sit down and plan your financial future. While no program can completely take the place of a qualified financial consultant, this program will certainly do an adequate job.

## COMPUTER CRAYONS Cheryl Howard, MCCC

This program by Playground Software, available at Federated for $25.88, is a very nice electronic coloring book for kids of all ages, including those adults who sometimes like to pretend they are a kid again. Computer Crayons comes complete with ready-to-paint scenes and a palette of vibrant colors. You also have the options of saving your masterpieces and restoring your picture quite easily. as well as the ability to adjust your brush size and erase your mistakes.

The visual menus which appear on the screen are all symbols which even the youngest child can relate to. Control of the cursor for in this program, a black crayon) is done with a joystick or an EDUMATE LIGHT PEN. Pictures are accessed by the use of the LETTERS symbol and the LITTLE HOUSE symbol. When you find the letter of the alphabet you like, move your black crayon to the LITTLE HOUSE symbol and press the button on your joystick. A picture, corresponding to the letter selected will appear. Now it is just a matter of moving your black crayon over to the AAROW symbol and pressing your joystick button to bring up the palette of colors. Select your favorite color by again moving your crayon to the desired color and pressing the button. Move up to the desired location to color, hold down the joystick button and move your joystick lever to color on the screen.

After you have completed your picture, you can activate the RUNNING MAN

symbol to animate your picture. This can be done at any time the picture is on the screen. You may also change the color selection by touching the BOX OF CRAYONS symbol. Kids, with their vivid imaginations, will probably want to color the picture in one set of colors, then touch this symbol to completely change the colors.

This program is not only fun but educational as well as children can associate the pictures with the letters of the alphabet, as well as learn what colors look good together.

## FLEX FILE 128 Clem Countess, MCCC

Flex File is an adyanced database program for the C128. It is a rewritten version of Practifile 64, also known as Flex File 64. The C128 version is similar to those programs in appearance and operation but is greatly improved and expanded.

Flex File is self-booting in 40 or 80 disk only once for the remainder of the column on either the 1541 or 1571 drives, and can be configured for single or dual drives. There ia also a C64 version on this same disk.

This new program is an outstanding example of programing that is designed to use the increased speed, expanded memory capacity, and increased disk storage of the C128 system. Flex File 128 is very similar to Practifile in purpose, appearance, and user handling; anyone having used the older program will be able to jump into the new one

## the inkery..

without even looking at the docs. The C64 files are also transferable to the C128 version. There are some readily obvious differences, thaugh, like much faster loading and a Directory command to the main menu. When operating with only one disk drive, Practifile could wear you out swapping the program and data disks. Flex File 128 eliminates this problem by loading the entire program into memory, then swapping to the data session. However, the new program does support two drives beautifully

Based on my limited use of Superbase 64, I suspect that Flex File 128 is not as broad or powertul as that program, but it isn't necessary to take a six-week course to learn to use it. I think the primary application areas for Flex File address books, mailing lists, organization membership rosters, etc. It will permit you to sort your data on any of three preselected key fields such as alpha sort by lastname/firstname, or by zipcode for bulk mailing. Criteria can be defined to select the records to be printed: just follow the menu prompts to be guided through with no confusion. It is also easy to design and organize a printed report or address labels.

A file created with Flex File 128 can have up to 40 fields and 254 characters. With a 1571 drive, a file can contain as many as 8,000 records of 31 or fewer characters (such as names and phone numbers), or 1,100 records in a file of 254 characters each. Cut these numbers in half if you are using a 1541 drive. (Cont. p.6)

The mouse interface is very Barbarian good and is acheived through a row of icons along the bottom of the screen. Larry Vance Catalina Commodore These icons are large enough and simpie Computer Club enough not - more (Y)/N/NS? ns to interfere with the rapid selections that have to be made. In fact, after you have lost approximately 100 lives, you begin to memorize the various combination of selections that you must make. I have even seen these moments in my dreams.

Can you become Hegor the Barbarian? Are you the warrior who can enter the fearful realms of the underground world of Durgan, a world terrorized by the evil Necron? Your quest is to destroy the lair of the accursed Necron. Your prize is the kingdom's crown. Your task is awesome! You must live on your wits, conquer your innermost fears, use every skill and weapon available to you. Hideous perils await. Can you survive?

This is the challenge that awaits you as you read the manual for the game, Barbarian. It sounds like quite a challenge and I have to admit that although I have been playing the game for about two weeks, I have yet to meet the challenge.

![Image](1988_03_artifacts/image_000005_894688fae07071ee73cb8d4bb9c341942d824a96e22f16abe02cebeee95f99bb.png)

Thus, as you enter the lair farther and Dark Castle farther, each new challenge becomes a Silicon Beach Software little harder. You will have · the Barbara Cramer opportunity to pick up objects as you go along and increase your choice of weapons.

I love 'run &amp; jump' arcade games. Jumpman, Loderunner and The Castles of I usually try to finish a game before Dr. Creep were among my favorites. Now writing a review of it, but in this case, I there is one for the Amiga, Dark Castle. think that Barbarian is such a good game Already released for the IBM, I had heard that perhaps some of you will try it and much about this game and was eagerly help me get past the swinging hammer! awaiting its arrival.

All in all, I would highly recommend this game. You must have the patience to start over and over and over as there is no save feature and as with most adventures, once you complete the quest, "That's all folks!" If some of you were disappointed with Psygnosis' first release called Brataccus (released by Mindscape) This one will be a pleasant surprise. The improvements are great and the mouse movements do not hinder the play. You just have to figure which moves to make and in what order. Sounds simple until you try it!

Your assignment: Overthrow the black knight but first you must safely pass through fourteen danger zones, each more treacherous than the last. To make things worse, they are each guarded by everything from flying monkeys to dragons. You have a handful (60) rocks for fending of anything that stands in your way and four extra lives for those instances when you are caught with your guard down. Bottles of elixir and extra rocks are plentifully scattered along your way. As your quest progresses you may also come upon a mace, fireballs and a magic shield to aid your cause.

My first reaction to this 2 dimensional game of tact and strategy was utter delight. The creatures are thoroughly delightful, well drawn and animated and accompanied by a humorous soundtrack. For a while, it was more fun to listen to the grunts and groans of my 'man' as he perished over and over again. Silencing the laughing little trolls was another joy Which momentarily distracted /Cont.

me from the obvious goal. But soon I settled down to the job i had been assigned.

Mastering the keyboard and mouse contol of your fighting and manuevering More skills will take a bit of time. While I am not a teenage arcade whiz, l am not an amatuer either. I eventually managed to make it through one of the first screens - TWO hours later. With an hour more of practice and varying startegy approaches, I made it through the one of the other beginning choices. At the end of FIVE hours, I had scarcely made a dent in the solution.

I quickly learned that precision was only second to impeccable timing in mastering Dark Castle. This is not a game for the beginner. Presistence and a high tolerance of frustration is essential to the enjoyment of each screen. Not only must you return to the very beginning after each game is lost, you must constantly sit through the loading of 2 opening screens which have very little to do with your first challenge. This would not be so bad if you were given a save game feature in order to save your progress as you mastered each level. No such luck. To reach theend you must continually perfect your skill on the lower levels.

All in all, I would recommend Dark Castles to the younger set who have the time and persistence to see it to the end. I enjoyed playing the garne but my frustration with failure eventually overcame my enjoyment. Born arcade gamers will love it. (Ed. Note: DARK CASTLE is available at BABBAGE'S)

DELUXE HELP FOR DELUXE PAINT I Vikki Highfield

The Club-South News Birmingham, AL

Regardless of what the primary purpose people choose the Amiga over any other brand, many want, in some point in time, to take advantage of the fantastic graphic capabilities of this computer. To do this they purchase one of the graphic drawing programs avallable, usually Deluxe Paint I1 by Electronic Arts. Using this program to the fullest extent of its power requires a great deal of reading and referencing of the large manual provided. How many times have you tried to produce a graphic using the full features of Deluxe Paint only to find you cannot remember exactly how to do it and have to refer to the manual? Well, throw that manual away! Help has arrived!

RGB Video of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, has provided us with a program called "DeluxeHelp for Deluxe Paint II" which is in essence an online tutorial of Deluxe Paint II. DeluxeHelp for Deluxe Paint Il is loaded from the internal drive with Deluxe Paint II loading on the external drive and running as a background task. It provides pull-down menus and actual real-live demonstrations of using the different applications provided in the Deluxe Paint I program. Deluxetelp uses a form of the program journal which actually records the mouse movements the programmer used in demonstrating the different Deluxe Paint lessons and you see them on the screen exactly as if you

were sitting next to him when he did them. By swapping the screens back and forth you are provided with an instant on-line tutorial while you are actually drawing a picture with Deluxe Paint Il.

If you have expanded memory of at least one megabyte DeluxeHelp's Mouse Talker voice module will explain the process as you go along. If you are just trying to learn to use Deluxe Paint this interactive tutorial allows you to learn at your own pace by watching expertly prepared lessons being demonstrated before you on an active Deluxe Paint I| screen. Over 50 lessons are provided online on the DeluxeHelp disk.

Another advantage of this program is that as a registered owner you are qualified to receive free member access to their Amigalink BBS where you can obtain a wealth of public domain Amiga Programs, plus additional Deluxe Paint I

lessons which could not fit on the absolutely packed DeluxeHelp disk. The program will run on all three of the Amigas with 512 K ram and 2 drives, however to take advantage of the MouseTalk module you must have at least one megabyte of expanded memory. This program is expertly done and reasonably price at only $19.95. I think it would be a valuable asset to anyone who uses Deluxe Paint II.

MCCC NEWS: HEB CHAPTER Glenn Schneider, President

Twas the night before the meeting and all through my mind, Lots of creatures were stirring to kick my behind.

The program was all set by P Jack and Jesse, his elf, Librarian Cheryl had all the latest disks, hot off the shelf.

Treasurer fred would be there with new disks to sell, But please tell me why does my stomach feel like hell.

A notice was put on the BBS for the meeting to be held, When that very night the modems did melt.

As the dark clouds began to gather I wanted to scream, I'T do me a favor and calm myself down with some chocolate ice cream.

Now I sit at the keyboard, a beer in my hand, It is rather daubtful my kids will see age 10.

The ice cream munchkins have struck my freezer again, They devoured it all with no respect for President Glenn.

Easyscript, Speedscript and Word Writer sit in my disk holder, But Librarian Cheryl says try "The Write Stuff", she says "Be bolder."

For tomorrow she says I must turn this report in, For those are the rules and Editor Bennett will not bend.

I feel much better as I finish this prose, I think the beer begins to tickle my nose.

The voices inside me are yelling "Write on - write on", And finish the report - on construction paper with my children's crayons.

February's meeting was a very interesting one featuring a four-part presentation by a representative from Hai-Tex, a software company.

The first program demonstrated was a spreadsheet by Hai-Tex called Hai-Calc. Next was an incredible CAD program from Taurus which is being marketed by Hai-Tex. It is called X-CAD and was designed to compete with the popular Auto-CAD, and would seem to be a hands-down winner with an unoffical line update 60 times faster than the IBM compatible program. Third was A-Drum, a drum machine which can play any sound fed into it. Last, but certainly not least, was a 3D animation program which turned out to be a sneak preview for chapter members since it is not due out on the market for another few months. The 3D effect was achieved

The aim of this store is to be the largest Amiga supplier in this country, offering huge selections and mail-order prices. Welcome to the Metroplex and we wish you luck! (Ed. Note: See Ad p. 11)

Chapter business included the changing of our name to the Amiga Central Chapter since we are no longer the only one for the Amiga. We look forward to this addition to our ranks as an opportunity to double the infomation we contribute to the Amiga community.

And thanks to Kerry Batts (with an assist from Jody) for an excellent and entertaining MIDI demo. It looks like music on the AMIGA is well supported by club members, judging by the crowd drawn to the front after the demonstration.

The next meeting will be March 8th at the North Richland Hills Community Center, southeast corner of Rufe Snow and Loop 820, at 7:30pm. The program will feature a Maxi-Pian demo and will give me a little ammunition to use on the wife when she tells me to stop playing games. "Look honey, the budget!"

## BOARD OF DIRECTORS NOTES John Malmstrom, Secretary

The Board of Directors held their regular meeting at Western Hills Inn in Euless on February 6, 1988.

President Harold Williams opened the meeting by welcoming all members present and pointed out that any member of the club is welcome to attend any board meeting. The voting members of the board consist of the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, librarian, newsietter editor, educational training coordinator, BBS coordinator, and chapter representatives (chapter president or designee and additional representatives based on chapter size). Harold then presented a brief review of some of the major issues that will be facing the club in the coming year.
