## METCOOD-88

a RepoRt by lack OctoRe

## What did MCX accomplish at METCOW*98?

The area dealers were: Amazing Computers showing MAGNI for the Amiga 2000, Brook Mays Music Co, Budget Computers with new 64/128 software, Computer Age with X-CAD for the Amigs, Computer Skills with X-SPECS, interComputing, inc, Metropolitan with desktop publishing and 13, and Software Terminal with their new games by Scott Lamb and their new security system Suppliers were: Benetech Electronics (Amiga 23-pin connectors), Label Appeal,

We hosted major developers: just about every dealer of Commodore computers in the Metroplex, several service and accessory dealers, a good percentage of the members and guests of SCOPE as well as MOCC user groups and several folks who came thru who were curious about Commodore and related products As hosts we provided educational service through our tutorial booths for Commodore 64,128 and Amiga computers and software; made available our public domain libraries, provided hands-on on-line familiarization with many local and national BES and network database services thru our telecommications booth, provided an economical way for new users to get started with products from our flea market, and sponsored lectures and demonstrations about new products and utilities for these computers. Computer artistry was present. In music: a terrific performance by electronic musician, Jaxon Crow, operating an Amiga/MIDI system sponsored by Peter Rafeiner of interComputing, inc., and a new six-voice stereo cartridge capability for the C64. Beautiful Amiga graphic art by Jean Riley was also evident and pleased many judging from ber sales. Specifics and Software, Etc. Area developers were: Microbotics, Precision, Inc, and ELWII Enterprises

Kyle McCoy, the new Commodore district sales rep and Andre Fresch of the Atlanta regional office talked to our group. Rick Bilyea of Software Terminal carried out on-line game competitions before the big screen. Bob Krause, Ft. Morth Chapter president, demoed PaperClip Publisher for the 64/128 Harold Williams, club president, presented a medley of utilities for the Commodore 128. Jaxon Crow presented an Amiga/Midi performance accompanied by laser interpretation that was fascinating and entertaining

At least two products premiered: SuperBase Personal 2 and TeleEpic. I suspect that there was at least one more. Edward Wilson Ill talked about computer viruses and provided ways to detect and exterminate them. New product videos were provided by NewTek, ROB Videos, Byte-By-Byte, and 3D Systems (stereolithography).

Doorprizes, distributed by Harold Williams and family, were provided by several dealers and developers including Broderbund, Label Appeal, MicroBotics, OXXI, Precision, Software Terminal, and STARTEXT. Prizes included several versions of SuperBase (even the new SuperBase Professional) provided by Precision and an 8UPI board with a pair of POPSIMMS provided by MicroBotics.

## Was it worth the effart?

A lot of effort goes into a show like METCOM*93 by all the participants dealers and developers haul their wares and cover the expense: user group members plan, execute, and provide most of the sweat and some of the brains. The club president presides

Dallas/Ft. Worth

ISSUE 12

over the event and the vice-president directs preparations. Other members of the METCOM*88 staff included: Ned Kelly, deputy director (note: director for 1989); Bill Keatley, Betty Clay and John Schneider, publicity; John Malmstrom, registrations; Bill Racke, membership specials; Tony Velez, club librarian with Glenn Herring for 64/128 and Gary Campbell for Amiga; Roy Baker for tutorial booths; fred Noble, members flea market; and Okley Moss, assisted by Betty Clay, telecommunications booth.

There is no substitute for the very special support provided by spouses during this kind of event I want to especially thank MCCC wives that I know were in there at "METCOM"88". My wife JoAnne, was working MEICOM*98 in many ways since January - putting up with my weekend chores undone, getting bulletins printed, supples rounded up, beaucoup phonecalls, and at the last minute being on-hand at home to make TWO emergency runs to the Convention Center. Jill Campbell, Edna Malmstrom, Evelyn Racke and Judy Willams worked the tables and, Im sure, belped to get ready in the weeks before. Many others were also behind the scenes.

Was it worth it? Of course! What Ive heard is that dealers and developers want to come back next year. Some ot the national developers want to come Your club officers would like to make sure that more of the general public wants to come next year. What really counts is that there is enough fun to go around

Peter Rafeiner, in a follow up message after METCOM*88, says that to respond to interest he's had in the Amiga/MIDi systems, he is willing to have people meet with Jaxon Crow at his office to learn about the technical aspects of setting up and operating the systems. There would be a modest fee to cover Jaxon's time for the instruction.

so that PEOPLE want a METCOM*89 and will be looking forward to participating this coming year.

This is the kind of spirit

## What about next year?

that makes it better for all of us in the Metroplex: developers, dealers, service specialists, users, artists and those who are curious but have not yet acted. With no effort, nothing good is realized.

Yes, therell be one next year, tentatively set for Saturday, October 14, at the Arlington Convention Center - again sharing the building with our friends with the Senior Citizens' Craft show. Ned Kelly, as our new club Vice-President, will be director for METCOM*89. Based on feedback from participants this year, here are some of the things we are considering:

1. Open up the rooms devoted to the auditorium and dealers area in 1900 as one large booth hall with a sound stage centrally located. The sound stage can be used or prepared during the day independently of the auditorium areas.
2. 2 Have auditoriums for Amiga and C64/C123 events in separate presentation rooms.
4. Plan to have telecommunications with the METCOM*89 staff booth near the section with the Amiga library and tutors.
3. Plan to have another flea market with the C64/C128 section of library and tutors.
5. Invite more of the general public and national developers to participate.

Ned Kelly will be contacting us all as he zeros in on - METCOM*89. Don't miss it!

## The CommodoRe 1084S @DonItOR a hardware Review by lohnny Kitchens Mid-Cities CommodoRe Clud

Recently Commodore introduced a new monitor. Although this monitor is not totally new, it is the monitor the Amiga should have had all along. The reason is that this monitor has stereo sound. 1084S is clearly pointed to the Amiga, but can be used with other computers as well

Commodore must be planning to sell this monitor to all Commodore buyers. The 1084S comes packaged with four cables. One for the Amiga, a cable for the C-128 or the Commodore PC to be used to display RGBI, a cable for C-b4 or C-128 in composite (Separated ICA display), and finally a cable to connect the Amiga stereo sound to the monitor.

Technical specifications of the 10845 match the 1084 as far as video performance is concerned it has 13 inch screen, in-line dot, pitch 042mm. The resolution is 640 lines in center (RGB MODE). Sound specs show that it has 1 watt at 5% distortion (per channel. Definitely not something to get excited about compared to even a low priced stereo.

The 1084S offers four display modes Composite, Separated LCA (Luma-Chroma-Audio), Digital RGBI (Red/Green/Blue Intensity), and Analog RGB. This covers just about any 40/80 column display you could want

There are many monitors on the market that will have better screen images; some of these cost quite a bit more. But I can only compare it to the Amiga 10B0A which has sat reliably on my Amiga If for two years. A side by side comparison showed advantages and

Adjustments on this monitor are very complete. There are 7 adjustments beneath a front cover which include Hue, Brightness, Contrast, Color, Sharpness, Volume, and a switch for CVBS or RGB. On the back are six more adjustments, some of which may be new to some users. They are a VCR switch that adjust the monitor's circuitry to display VCR or Video Camera images, a Vertical Height adjustment, a Vertical Centering adjustment, a Horizontal Centering adjustment, a Horizontal Width adjustment, and a CVBS/CA switch allowing a choice of composite or separated LumaChroma-Audio signals. This is a very complete monitor for the price: less than $350

disadvantages of each. The 1084S has a much better control accessibility. You can easily read what each knob is as well as get your fingers on the controls. This is one area where they learned from experience: the 1080A controls were always bard to locate and to adjust.

The big question is, how's the picture? In a side by side comparison the 1084S bas the edge over the 1D80A The colors appear to be brighter and the images appears to be sharper, but there is a price to pay. The IDaDA has a anti-glare finish on the screen to stop reflections on the screen from light sources around the room. Obviously this coating is costing part of the image quality to do its job. The 10o4s screen is slick and shiny and shows reflections from everything. This is the one glaring fault I can really point out It can be a bit annoying. There is not a major difference in picture quality so if you have a luduA, I might say keep it.

Stereo sound may not be a reason to switch either. When I first started playing music I couldn't hear the stereo separation. After trying different songs and moving around the monitor I still couldn't get the stereo sound. I came to the conclusion that the speakers position was the problem. They face outward directing the sound at a 90 degree angle from the user. I found a simple cure I taped a some cardboard at a angle over the speakers. This directed the sound towards me and stereo sound became a reality. The bigger the cardboard the better. Adjusting the angle of the two even gave some balance control - one control missing from this monitor. Of course hooking any Amiga to a stereo will blow the sound of the stereo monitor away. The monitor also has a hook-up for stereo headphones which is a very nice feature. Listening to an Amiga with a good set of stereo headphones can be a new experience, and can be helpful if the sound is annoying to those around you

If your just getting into the world of Amiga you might consider the 1084S. If you already have a monitor and stereo book-up then there is little reason to try it If you have a 1080 monitor the sound improvement of the 10845 may not be a good enough reason to move up An amplified speaker system can be cheaper.

## amiga StaRtap Routine

## OV Roy FRIsque Reprinted From Scantines

The Amiga must go through a complicated set of system test routines before you can do any work on it During the system test the Amiga is attempting to determine and let you know if the system is well. Here is a list of the start-up activities:

- 2 Disable DMA and interrupts during the test
- 1 Clear all chips of old data.
3. Clear the screen.
4. Check the hardware (68000).
5. Change screen color.
6. Do a checksum test on all ROMS.
7. Change screen color.
9. Check RAM at $C0000 - more SYSBASE there.
8. Begining of system startup.
10. Test All CHIP RAM.
- Il Change screen color.
- 13 Change screen color.
- 12 Check that software is coming in ok.
- 14 Setup CHIP RAM to receive data.
15. Link the libraries.
16. Check for additional memory and link it
- 18 Start a default task.
17. Turn the DMA and interrupts back on.
- 19 Check for 68010, 68020, and/or 68881.
20. Check to see if there is an exception.
21. If so do a system reset.

![Image](1988_12_artifacts/image_000002_46640a6cc7a5952847ac85705dfc628607f038ef9facb86fe4fa181d471fce6a.png)

During this system test the Amgia is sending vital information to the screen with colors. If the system checks out ok, you will see the following sequence that you have seen so many times.

DARK GRAY: The initial hardware tested OK. the 68000 is running and the registers are readable. LIGHT GRAY: The software is coming in and seems OK.

WHITE: The intialization test have passed

RED: If an error was found in ROM. GREEN: Error found in the CHIP RAM. BLUE: Error was found in the custom chips. YELLOW: If 68000 found an error before the error trapping software (GURU) was running,

If something is wrong with your system, you may see the following:

The Keyboard has it's own processor, RAM and ROM. regulatest is peformed on power up in the following

- 2 Checks 64 bytes of RAM.
- 1 Performs checksum on ROM's.
3. The timer is tested

If the keyboard does not pass the test it will notify you that it is not working properly. This information is indicated with the blinking of the CAPS-LOCK light.

4. Performs handshake with computer and gives results of selftest

One Blink Keyboard ROM check failed. Two Blinks. Keyboard RAM checked failed. Three Blinks: Watch dog timer failed. Four Blinks A short between two row lines or special control keys.

If you are having problems with the Amiga, perhaps these codes will help you and your repairman.

## Whats New at Babbages Software Review By CheRyl howard Mid-Cities Commodore Clud

CAVEMAN UGH-LYMPICS is this months top C64/128 game. Most of the game software today is of a very serious nature, with the computerist trying to save the world from aliens or entering into a major quest. Not much is out there just for the fun of it In fact, some of us prefer the silly, nonsense programs that allow us to just sit back and relax. CAVEMAN UGH-LYMPICS is just that sort of program; silly yet very entertaining. (A special thanks to Tony and Chris for previewing this program for me while I was having computer problems.) This crazy program has excellent graphics and is joystick controlled. Much of the joystick action is reminiscent of the Olympic Games programs put out by Epyx, so anyone familiar with those games will have no trouble adapting to this one.

## Software For This Review Provided by BABBAGES

-

As you enter the program, you are given 6 caveman athletes to choose from. There are six events to compete in and four game options Practice, Start Games, Cave of Fame and Restart The events include: Mate Toss, Saber Tooth Tiger Race, Dino Vault, Dino Race, Clubbing, and Fire Starting.

Saber Tooth Tiger Race - Here you run over obstacles to the safety of a tree to escape the Saber Tooth Tiger that is chasing you Obstacles include rocks and cactus which will slow your contestant

Mate Toss - In this event you grab your mate by the ankles and slowly start to spin him/her around. Gradually build up speed spinning counterclockwise. When you reach the spinning speed you are happy with, press the joystick button to release your mate to go flying through the air. The length of the toss determines how your mate will react. Hint Mates like to be thrown very far.

down as he runs out of breath. Watch out for the tiger as nothing slows him down and if he catches you, wel-1--1-l, that's all folks.

Dino Vault - Pole vault over the mouth of a dinosaur.

Dino Race - Horse racing with a twist. There are obstacles on the race course, so watch out.

Clubbing - stand on a cliff and try to beat your opponent silly with your trusty club. You can distract him, but turn-about is fair play,

Fire Starting - Rub sticks together to start a spark, then blow. Keep blowing to get fire started You can hit your opponent if he gets ahead of you, but you can get hit yourself.

GRAND SLAM BASEBALL puts you right down on the playing diamond as baseball greats Steve Garvey and Jose Canseco are opposing team captains in a duo of pure baseball games, played by the major league rules and based on real percentages, times and strategies You can either play baseball as it has always been played or you can go on to Grand Slam Baseball in which only grand slam home runs will score points for your team. This is a one or two player game controlled by joystick You have control over the pitching, hitting, fielding, throwing and baserunning. You can even start your own league. One of the nicest features about this game is the automatic screen scrolling from side to side to follow the action. Even to an baseball novice like myself, this looks like an interesting game.

For all you quest seeking adventurers, TIMES OF LORE by Origin is the latest program to hit the shelves. My quest adventurer did not have time to go through this one since it is time for six weeks test in school, and I definitely am not into quests However, what little I was able to figure out was impressive and well put together. From all appearances, this game is on the way to the top.

## amiga By-The-Loop BRent Wood

With the national elections just over, the "loop" chapter unanimously accepted the proposed slate of club officers for next year. (Of course, all races were uncontested.) Next time we elect our chapter officers. There is still a slot available for a nomination for chapter secretary. The position will be filled by the elected president until someone else volunteers for that post.

Last month's meeting featured David Anspach and his HP-PaintJet Color Graphics Printer and many fantastic color pictures he has printed. The printer is very fast with most pictures taking less than 5 minutes to print in over 300 colors. David also showed us Express Paint from Brown-Wagh Publishing. This is a great graphics/desktop publishing package with lots of nice features. Lots of elbowing going on to get a look at both of these items Thanks, David!

It should be noted that the club's by-laws specify that a chapter must have at least 4 officers for said chapter to remain in the club. We walk a narrow line by not electing a fifth officer. Normally, nominations are closed at the monthly meeting prior to the elections. This time we will allow &amp; member to fill this spot at the last minute. Consider this post if you are interested in serving the club.

Next time well feature "Tele-Epic" from Software Terminal, well conclude our election business as mentioned above and well begin looking toward 1989 for all those promised products! The December meeting will be held Tuesday, December 13th at 730 pm at the NRH Church of Christ This falls after the club Christmas party on Sunday the Ilth. Hope to see you at both events! Happy Holidays!

## FORT WORTh

MaRy Loarse bağemeyer

The Fort Worth Chapter voted to elect all the nominees for club and chapter officers for next year. The chapter nominees were listed in last month's newsletter.

Our thanks go to Herschel Gibbs of the Arlington/Grand Prairie Chapter for his demonstration of music programs. He discussed the SID chip, played some songs with Sidplayer, and guided the audience in writing a few measures of music in Sidplayer format. He told us how a second SID chip could be added to the C54, either by modifying the computer or by plugging in a cartridge, and he played his arrangement of "Mississippi Mud" for stereo C64, proving that six voices are more than twice as good as three

Donald Tate reviewed library disk #418, which he described as baring lots of programs that are lots of fun. In particular, he mentioned a color chart and test, a sketch program, and a graph plotter.

We won't have a chapter meeting in December but hope to see everybody at the club's Christmas party.

ack slay, there ares no official meting of the H Chapter in November. Among the members present, recommendations were made for Eldor Luedtke, Jr. to be nominated as President and Jack Slay as Vice President because of his previous knowledge of the position.

The next general meeting is January 21 at 130pm at the Hurst Rec. Center.

He then spent 2112 hours socializing and making disk copies from the library while Eldor Luedtke, Jr. demonstrated the Geos 128 program. Some disk sales and membership renewals were made.

See y'all at the Christmas party.

## TORT WoRth Night Bill Jones

At the Night Chapter meeting this month Jim Marshall gave an interesting program on how to minimize loss and recover data when you have the wrong disk in your drive and you start the reformat procedure This included not only how to stop the procedure but also how to recover data by rebuilding the BAM.

This was the last meeting of the Night Chapter since we will not be meeting in December. After the first of the year we will be merging with the Ft Worth chapter. I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those members who have been the ones who I could count on to be at every possible meeting. You don't know how much encouragement I have received from knowing that my efforts were not completely in vain. My thanks also go out to Don Stevens and Clay Sutton for serving as chapter officers this year. Finally I want to extend a special thank you to Bruce Umbreit and Jim Marshall for volunteering to present several programs and filling in on less than three hours notice when the person · scheduled to give the program could not come to the meeting.

If you weren't in attendance at the November meeting - you blew it Our program was a presentation of Invision working with Amiga Live Image processing at real-time speeds of 30 frames per second. No, that's not a misprint - and it is pretty amazing. Amiga Live captures the images from a camera or VCR and Invision processes them as quickly as they are captured Our thanks to Jim Pomeroy for a "captivating" (pun intended) demonstration.

At our November meeting, we "gobbled up" the informative program presented by Okley Moss on the MCCC Bulletin Boards. He demonstrated how to start out as a new user and continued with various features for both Graphics and ASCIl BBS's, plus how to use the buffer for sending and receiving He also stressed the need for bulletin board user support. Let's all try a little harder to support and use our bulletin boards. Our SYSOPs do a great job.

Congratulations go to Don Mckinney - our door prize winner of the month Don took home a roll-top disk holder.

For those who didn't make it to the November meeting, be sure not to miss December's. Our presentation will feature Scott Lamb and Software Terminal's latest creation designed to give your computer something to do to while away those lonely hours when you are not there to entertain it A new home sentry system. Lots of bells and whistles. Don't miss it.

President Glen Herring announced that the MCCC Christmas party is scheduled for December 1l He presented the proposed slate of officers for election at the December meeting and also stressed the need for everyone to support the monthly Saturday workshops held at the Grand Prairie Library.

See you at the Christmas Party on December 11 and at our regular meeting - third Thursday, as usual December 15.
