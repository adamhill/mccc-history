## The Phoenix PFD-135 External Disk Drive Henry Colonna, AML Report

I jumped on the opportunity to buy a used Amiga 1000 several months ago, and when I did everyone I anew who oned an Aniga vas telling ne to buy a second disk drive along with the computer. I kept thinking "nah, Connodore sells then with one drive, it'll be OK." Within tvo hours of actually using the computer, I was desperate for a second However, I had spent just about all the noney I had, and simply could not afford a second Commodore disk drive.

I did some shopping around, and noticed that a corpany naned Phoenix was selling a alternative to Cornodore's external disk drive. When the drive arrived, I vas disappointed to tind a ribbon cable on the back instead of a regular cable. Everyue in the store vas snickering behind my back that this drive used "older ribbon cable" technology, which supposedly produces more RFI interference than normal cables. Hovever, in real-life use I have had no problems with the disk drive, and the next shipment of drives had normal cables, and every shipment since then. The drive 1s smaller than the Carnodore drive, though it is a bit longer. It is very thin and short, making it physically attractive. After several months of use I have found that it runs admirably under all conditions. with one potentially serious draback that I will describe in a second. During multitasking, the drive gets noisier and seans to rattle, but is usually a lot quieter even after heavy use than the Connodore drives.

It was a bit disconcerting during my first multitask to hear the drive rattle louder, hovever, it is perforning nornally besides the sound. The potentially serious drawback of this disk drive is the way that the "busy" light on the drive vorks. It does not stay on steadily, for some reason it blinks during disk accesses. The blinking does not becone a problem except during DOS operations or during ARC operations. Otten the drive light vill shut off for a good second or two and then cone back on again. Removing the disk during that period when the drive light is off will result in a trashed disk. I trashed many disks at first before I realized what was happening with the drive light. Fortunately they were all recoverable in every way with the sharevare progran "DiskSalv", but the operation of the drive light nay be a serious drawback. I have noticed that the Comnodore drives behave occasionally in this fashion, but the Phoenix does it much more often. When I was pondering this revieu I was considering giving it a "danning" review because of the problen I mentioned above. Hovever, upon careful thought I reconsidered. Many people trash many disks with the Comnodore disk drive at first and if anything would leam their lesson quicker. Yes, I know, that's bordering on warped logic, but what can I say. Overall, because of the $20 to $40 savings and the 1 year warranty (compared to Comodore's 90 day warranty) and flawless, quiet performance I would give the drive a cautious nod. If saving that amount of money is of little consequence, get the real thing.

## AMIGA CENTRAL CHAPTER

## Tim Flynn

Well, by now anyone who read last months article knows not to ask me for tips on either stocks or horses. (Although I do have this great real estate deal...)

We might not have had doves bursting forth from the monitors but they did have some interesting displays on them. Thanks to all those who showed us half a stage full of equipment he gave a very detailed presentation of the sound capabilities of the AMIGA, including some original songs he developed. Here again we got a taste of the future when he demonstrated an advance copy of a music synthesizer
