MID-CITIES COMMODORE CLUB MCCC NEWS

DALLAS/FORT WORTH TEXAS ISSUE 1

JANUARY 1988

## THE PRESIDENTS COLUMN

I purchased a COMMODORE 64 in January of 1983. The 64 had been selling for $595 and the price had just dropped to $400. I didn't purchase any software (there was almost none) and I couldn't afford a disk drive or a monitor. I bought a cassette drive for data storage and used the family T.V. for a monitor. About a month later I saw a notice that a users group was being formed in Hurst. About 75 COMMODORE users attended the organizational meeting of what later became the Mid-Cities Commodore Club. We rapidly grew to a group that numbered in the 100's. We were split about equally into VIC 20 and COMMODORE 64 owners. There were even a few PET users in the group. Local businesses were attracted to our group and began to offer special discounts to members and would advertize our meetings in their stores. Strong supporters in the retail world were Videoland, Rave, and Taylor's Computors. The MCCC met once a month, published a newsletter that consisted of a couple of photocopied pages, and began collecting public domain programs for a disk library. Five years have passed and the MCCC has seen many changes. The cassette drive for data storage is now a legend from the Stone Age. Does anyone remember the first affordable home computer, the VIC 20? Rave and Taylor's are gone, and Videoland has become Federated. The MCCC has kept up with the changes. The COMMODORE 128 Personal Computer is often the highlighted machine at chapter meetings. The largest MCCC chapter supports the COMMODORE AMIGA. There are currently seven chapter meetings held each month. The software library consists of hundreds of disks containing thousands of programs. The MCCC News is now a professionally produced multi-page newsletter. The MCCC now supports two electronic bulletin boards The size and prestige of the MCCC has allowed us to attract nationally known speakers like Jim Butterfield and Dr. Eric Graham. As the MCCC begins its sixth year I don't wonder if the changes will continue. Change is the only constant. I wonder only what the changes will be. Harold Williams

## 64 BEGINNERS' OORNER

## By Rick Swallow, South Bay

I'm so glad you finally decided to invest in a Programmer's Reference Guide to help you with your programning! I'm sure your're wondering by now how you ever got along without it.

IF... THEN... is another Basic statement that checks for conditions. Type in the following:

- 10 PRINICHR$(147) 'WELCOME TO STUPIDITY DETECTOR"
- 20 INPUT"DO YOU NEED INSIRUCTIONS (Y/N)"; I$
- 30 IF I$="" THEN 30
- 40 IF I$="Y" THEN 100
- 50 IF I$="N" THEN 200
- 60 IF I$&lt;&gt;"N"OR I$‹&gt;"Y" THEN 20
- 100 PRINICHR$ (147) "JUST RUN THE PROGRAM, DUMMY"
- 110 FOR D=1 IO 2000: NEXI D
- 120 PRINICHR$(147): GOTO 20
- 200 PRINT"IF YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH TO GET HERE, YOU'RE NOT TOO STUPID!"

What a dumb program, but it illustrates one use of IF... THEN.... Line 10 clears the screen with CHR$(147) and prints a statement on screen. Line 20 waits for an input to the question it poses. Line 30 says "If the input is nothing (empty quotes) then stay at line 30 until something IS input. " Line 40 directs the program to line 100 if the input is "y" and line 50 Jumps to line 200 if input is "N". Line 60 is like a trap. It says "If the input is not a "Y" or an "N" then go back to line 20 and wait until the user presses one of these. " This ascertains that only "Y" or "N" will be accepted as input. If the condition which follows an IF... THEN... is not true, then the line is completely ignored and the next is executed. Therefore, If the user were to have pressed anything but the "y" or "N", the computer drops through lines 30, 40, and 50, and acts on line 60. You have a lot of fun expanding the statements on this program! ...

## CODE QUEST

## By Robert Thomas, CCCC

When you were in elementary school, did you ever try to write or decipher a secret message? I remember that, even as late as high school, a few friends and I learned the finger spelling used by the deaf so that we could "talk" across the room without classmates understanding or teachers our private conversations.

Code Quest by Sunburst Connunications ($65) is a conputer gane which draws on children's natural interest in secret messages and has an educational value roughly equivalent to playing Scrabble.

For each mystery object, progran gives the user six clues. Each clue cones in a cipher, but the user can choose which of the seven cipher options will be used for each clue. The seven options are as follows:

1. Written backwards (EN OS IHT = THIS ONE)
2. With numbers substituted for 1 etters (A=3, B=4, C=5)
3. With letters of the alphabet s hifted to the original ones (A=D, B=E, C=F)
4. With words standing for letter s (taffy=A, chile=B)
5. Scrambled letters using a box grid
6. Pictures in which the first le tter is the deciphered one (an app le = A, a boat = B)
7. "Super Sleuth", in which the c ipher is randonly picked by the co mputer from the list above.

The educational justification for Code Quest is that it exercises the skills of scanning for clues, analytical thinking, pattern recognition, flexibility in perception, and facility with the alphabet. The grade levels it applies : to are given as 4-6, but the gane could easily be extended into adulthood.

Code Quest enbodies numerous helpful features. Teachers and students can create, delete, and save their own nystery objects and clues fron which the progra» will generate the appropriate ciphers. The progran is totally selfcontained and does not require any assistance fron the teacher. A good HELP function is available, revealing more deciphering aids and hints each time used, but always stopping short of giving the answer. There is a unique TEST function whereby the user can test a theory on how to decipher a clue before trying it out on the clue itself. The user can SAVE the progran at any point (as when the school period ends) and return to the sane spot later, even if other people have used the progran in the There used the. an ESCAPE function by which the user can tersinate the progran at any tine.

It is sy opinion that Code Quest 1s primarily for the more advanced students; slow or learning disabled students would likely feel frustrated. However, playing Code Quest is a good reward for the bright student who finishes class work before the period ends or who finishes honework in study halls and wants sonething educational and fun to do in the evening.

SBCUG ED REM: The above listing will read a disk directory, then write a SEQuential text file to the disk that can be loaded by your word processor (if it can load SEQ text files). With Paper Clip you would use CTRL J to load it. I only tried It with a 84/1541, but It sure 1s handy if you'd like to be able to process your directory listings.

## SERIAL BOX BUFFER

By Terry Aaron, Bits &amp; Chips

The Serial Box (ta) is a 64K serial port buffer for Connodore computers. It is easy to connect to any Conmodore and is conpletely transparent to your syster. It powers up as a buffer for device #4, but for you programners, it responds as device #6.

Three LEDs on the Serial Box give status information: green=normal, amber=pause and red=full. An indication is also available to show the device is not present.

There are push - button switches. Pressing "pause" stop the printer (if active) and light the amber LED. Putting the buffer in the pause position will also allow turbobuffering. This condition allows the buffer to accept codes from the conputer faster than normal, in fact, it accepts codes as fast as your computer can send then (nearly 680 characters per second!). The other button is used to reset the line counter when skip-over-perforation feature is activated. Pressing both buttons simultaneously causes the buffer to clear.

My test results were great! You can print a 100-block progran in 15-30 seconds! means that you regain control of the computer nuch sooner than you normally would. The printer keeps printing while you keep conputing! would highly recommend the Serial Box 64K serial port buffer to everyone.

## Editor's Note:

Thanks are due to many people who have helped me on this, my first, newsletter ever. But special thanks are due to Bruce, Don, Clem, Okley, and John..

## SUE A COMPUTER

Things were going almost great Until she bought a one-two-eight. I'm planning suit in marriage court For affection mine "He" did abort; Not my spouse, but her computer Changed my place as ardent suitor.

My bed is empty, cold and bare Since my lovey is not there. I hear them talking in the den, Where she moved in to be with "Ken". I hope the judge will see my point And kick that "thing" out of my joint.

Our program who art in memary, Hello be thy name. Thy operating system come, Thy commands be done, At the printer as it is on the screen. Give us this day our daily data, And forgive us our 1/0 errors as we forgive those whose logic circuits are faulty. Lead us not into frustration, And deliver us from power surges. For thine is the algorithm, The application, and the solution, Looping forever and ever.

Uploading Text Files by Fred Mayes --- Commodore Users of Bartlesville

Do you know how to upload a sequential file onto a bulletin board? Sure! No problem. Compose it with a word processor, save it as a sequential file, call the bulletin board and upload it using Xmodem. Right. Well, perhaps. It depends on who you want to read it. If you do it like that, only Commodore users will be able to read it. I found this out when I tried to put some movie reviews downloaded from QuantumLink on CoBBS. Jim tole me that he was unable to read the files. When Harold uploaded a sample letter of protest to FCC about their proposed rate increase to CoBBS, Jim tole me that he was unable to read the file. These are files that should be accessible to everyone. Well, what is the problem, and what is the solution.

I played around with the results of an opinion poll - a short file I got off of QuantumLink. It was saved to my disk as a sequential file. I used a terminal program called Common Sense that came with the Commodore 1660 modem. It is a nifty program that has a lot of capabilities -- so many that I feel it is too powerful a program to be included with the modem. What's that? You don't want people to have it? Well, what I meant was, that there are a lot of settings that have to be made which can mess up a file if they aren't set right. It is a good program to grow into when you recognize the need to use the various settings, but a neophyte can get discouraged when he doesn't know why things aren't turning out right. What's the problem, anyway? Well, Commodore has its own wierd way of storing text.

It uses PetAscii, a variation of pure true blue ASCIl, which is what most other computers use When you give disks to each other, everybody can read its contents because all Commodores use PetAscii. When you upload to a bulleting board, all Commodores can read it, but Amiga, IBM, Radio Shack, Apple users can't cause they read ASCI!. The reason Commore went awry is because they had a "Better Idea" - we have all the screen graphics, cursor movements, colors and symbols that the other guys don't. Well, why don't things look scrambled when we read text that other people leave on bulletin boards? Cause our terminal programs intercept. the messages and translate them into PetAscii before they are put on the screen. Likewise, they convert our text to true blue ASCII when it is sent to the BBS. Ok -- that's the background. Common Sense has the ability to enable to disable this translation on files that are sent or received. There is also a "B" protocol which is supposed to be used with CompuServe. It must be turned off when not using CompuServe, but when the program is loaded, it is on - you must remember to turn it off. 1 uploaded the same opinion file to CoBBS five times. Once with B on, Transmit translate on, Receive translate on. Then with B off, transmit on, receive on. Then with B off, transmit off, receive on. Then with B off, transmit on, Receive off. Then with B off, transmit off, receive on. And then when B off, transmit off, receive off. I had Jim read the files. He could read all files when I had the transmit translate on. It wa garbage whenever I had it off. It wasn't

all garbage -- the upper case letters were lower case, the lower case letters were graphics, and the numbers were all right. I then turned around and downloaded each of the files using CommTerm 3++. This program gives you no choice of translation tables. I could read every file that had the translate off, but the ones that had translate on were in true blue ASCIl and could not be read without loading into a word processor that could read true blue ASCII (I think most do, but you have to know how to do it). I wanted them to be able to read the files without having to load them into a word processor.

I took the original file, loaded it into Pocket Writer 2, converted it to all upper case and saved it. Then I saved a copy of the file as a true blue ASCI file. I then uploaded the Commodore file and the ASCIl file onto CoBBS with transmit translate on and off. I also uploaded each file using CommTerm 3++.

I then turned around and downloaded each file using CommTerm 3++. Jim said the Commodore version with translate on was okay -- all upper case. The Commodore version with translate off wa garbage. The ASCIl version with translate on was okay -- all lower case The ASCIl version with translate off was okay -- all upper case. The Commodore version via CommTerm was garbage. The ASCIl version via CommTerm was okay -- all upper case. Then I took each file and loaded it into Pocket Writer 2 as a regular (Commodore) file, and then as an ASCII file. The Commodore file uploaded with translate on came out all lower case (Commodore) and all uppercase (ASCII). The Commodore files uploaded with translate off came out all uppercase both aas Commodore and as ASCI!. The ASCIl file with translate on came out gibberish as a Commodore file and all lower case as ASCIl. The ASCIl file with translate off came out in lower case as Commodr and uppercase as ASCIl. The Commodore file via CommTerm came out upper case both as Commodre and as ASCI!. The ASCII file via CommTerm came out lower case as Commodore and upper case as ASCII.

Whoa! What does all that mean? Well, in order for both Jim and Fred to read what Fred (or Harold) uploads using Modem, it must be entirely in upper case and saved to disk as an ASCIl file. Alternately, if you load the file into your buffer and transmit it using ASCII protocol, (rather than Xmodem), then the terminal program will handle the translation and everyone can read the file. You will also find out that using ASCIl uploads are the pits using CommTerm. It is EXTREMELY S L O W You may want to try out other terminal programs for ASCIl transmission speeds. So please remember this if you have a special message that you want everyone to read. And next time you sign on to a BBS, remember that everything you read is going through translation before you read it.
