(One of the Usenet participants uses it as the classic example of the failures of shareware.) Butterfield is also famous for his ten-hour course in machinelanguage programming, and for his book that parallels that course.

Who is Jim Butterfield? Since the Because of other commitments, Jim did beginning of home computers, Jim has not jump into the Amiga world as been one of the foremost writers and quickly as some of us did. For the past speakers in the Commodore year or more, however, he has been community. He hosts a monthly forum devoting a great deal of time to this on QuantumLink which is regularly machine. He is now an accomplished attended by hundreds of Commodore programmer in 68000 assembly and in users from all over the country.

For many years, Jim Butterfield was the programmer who distributed the most useful utilities Commodore owners could find. Programs such as COPY*ALL, DISK CHECK, DISK MOD, DISK- CHANGE, UNICOPY, FILESORT, and SUPERMON, games like ADVENTURE, BREAKOUT, and ANDROID NIM, and various utilities for computing mortgage payments, investment records, and income taxes kept his name on our

On April 16, Jim is scheduled to speak to Amiga owners at InfoMart during the morning session, from 10-12 A.M. In the afternoon, he will speak to the Commodore 64/128 owners from 1-3 P.M. Check the CCD schedule on STARTEXT.

We have not specified a topic on which Butterfield is to speak.. While he will certainly have some materials prepared in advance, we have asked him to conduct a discussion based on topics suggested by his audience. Please bring your questions to the sessions and speak up.

I. APRIL 23 TELECOMMUNICATIONS ARLINGTON CONVENTION CENTER.

## Ill. JUNE 11 COMMODORE SHOW AT INFOMART

There will be a Commodore-sponsored show at InfoMart on June l. Plans are far from complete at this time, but it is known that Commodore will be sending personnel. Other vendors are expected to have booths in the downstairs vendor area, and representatives from Commodore and from various software companies will conduct seminars throughout the day.

It is expected that this show will be a major Commodore show of the year. Many of the companies involved will be bringing large exhibits to Dallas that week because of the National Education Association's annual convention that will be held there during the week of June 13-17. The convenience of the dates will attract displays that would not otherwise be available.

This show is designed to serve Commodore owners from the four- state area covering Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The Commodore sales representative for this four-state area is giving the show high priority. Plans for this meeting have been discussed with Max Toy, president SHOW AT of Commodore, and with other high-level executives. Some of them hope to come.

Read Glenn Schneider's article to learn about this exciting show. Jack DeTore is organizing this event and you already know that when Jack plans an event, it is done right. You won't want to miss this one.

Unlike most shows of this sort, there will be NO admission fee for this show. You may attend all of the seminars and see all of the exhibits at absolutely no cost.

You will receive much more information about this show in the next two months, ASC! board is as plans are finalized. In the meantime, please mark it on your calendar. It promises to be the biggest Commodore show ever held in our area. Don't miss it!

## THE PRESIDENT'S COLUMN

## Harold Williams

The MCCC ASCII BBS has undergone several changes in the past few months. The suggestions for changes have come from BBS members and the MCCC BBS committee. The addition of new areas and options has made the ASCIl board more useful and easier to use. The ASCII BBS now has an area called On-Line Magazine for uploading, downloading, and browsing articles relating to the C- 64, C-128, and Amiga. Currently there are reviews of software packages, articles providing hints and tips for beginners, and articles of general interest to Commodore computer users available in the On-Line magazine. All BBS members are encouraged to submit articles to the On- Line magazine. The On-Line magazine also has a list of about 80 other local BBS numbers to call.

We now have a section devoted to club activities. The club activities section has information areas for each chapter of the MCCC, special club events, a complete calendar of current club activities and a copy of the MCCC constitution. You will also find a list of discounts that are currently available to MCCC members.

Another area recently added to the the Newsletter section. This section is provided to allow members to easily submit articles to the MCCC News. Articles uploaded to the Newsletter section are retrieved by the MCCC News editor for publication in the MCCC News.

An alphabetized user list has been added to allow members to easily look up the names of of other BBS members. The list is divided into three sections to speed up searches for names near the end of the alphabet.

The files section has also been revised to add some new options. A directory of files is now available in two new formats. Files can be listed in reversed date or alphabetical sequence. Capturing these directories in your terminals buffer will allow you to browse through the lists off-line. We currently have about 20 megabytes of public domain software available for download and that figure keeps growing as BBS members upload new software.

Users of the MCCC ASCII board owe a special thanks to Bill Raecke for all the work he has done to provide changes to the ASCII BBS. Bill has done all of the redesigning of menus, adding and rearranging of BBS options.

WHAT'S NEW IN SOFTWARE and mode of play is the same. A new and interesting concept the programs Cheryl Howard, MCCC have come up with, is a view of the competition similar to the television coverage of the actual games. This feature allows the player to set up television camera at different locations in the downhill skiing event to best capture your performance. In the ski jump event, you look down the slope just as the skier would see it. You are concerned, but now there are get the same simulation in the slalom

All seven events: Downhill Skiing, Slalom, Luge, Figure Skating, Ski Jump, Cross Country Skiing and Oval Track Speed Skating make this game a must for armchair Olympians.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to Babbage's policy of discounting software prices, there is No additional discounts to club members. Babbage's has a discount club in which customers receive credit for each $15 worth of programs purchased When you have purchased $150 worth of programs, you get a $15 professional wrestling that displays discount on your next purchase. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS IN-STORE DISCOUNT PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ALL CUSTOMERS!!!

Nobody Beats

Now that the mad rush to keep the computer software stores supplied during the Christmas season is over, the manufacturers are releasing their new programs. New releases have been minimal until the last month or so as far as Commodore 64 programs several new combat simulations, new event. word processing and application programs and several new games on the shelves. GEOS 128 from Berkley Software has been available for about a month, as well as Paperclip III, Outrageous Pages and Paperclip Desktop Publishing from Batteries Included. There are programs for combat simulation that deal with the American CIVil war, battles at sea, and a new supply of aircraft simulations. Echelon, the space flight simulation, is still a big seller. And of course there are games for every taste, from Hulk Hogan and his opponents as digital images similar to those found on the computer art pictures and shirts, to the recent Olympic games at Calgary, Alberta, Canada

This month, I begin a series of reviews of the new programs available at Babbages in North East Mall. Just released--Epyx's "The Games." (the 1988 Calgary Olympic games.) This latest in the Olympic series produced by Epyx begins with an impressive and realistic rendition of the Saddle Dome.

The overall graphics are better than previous editions, but the game strategy

## MODEM MADNESS

## Jon Pederson, SC-Cubed SACRAMENTO COMMODORE COMPUTER CLUB

"You need more excitement in your life!"

This. was the insisting I heed. message my friends kept

"Telecommunications is what's happening. Get involved. Get a modem."

Despite my ultraconservative nature, I was sensitive to good advice and hurried to the neighborhood computer store. There I was met by an eager salesman who looked all of 18. maybe.

"Yes, sir! How may I heip you, sir?"

If he tried any harder, we would both be embarrassed; as it was, only I was wondering what happened to restraint.

"I'm told I need a modem. To be honest, I know little abour these things. What do you have?"

My confession of ignorance seemed to spur him to greater excitement, impossible as that may sound.

"Oh, YES, Sir! What baud rate are you interested in, sir?"

"Bawd rate? Young man, I don't want a dirty joke machine. I just want to see one of these modem things."

"Yes, sir." For some reason, he seemed puzzled. "Oh, a joke, sir. Heh, heh." He brightened. "We not only have the 300s and 1200s. the actually have a 2400 right here in stock. Yes. sir." He appeared quite proud of that. Cont. p.8

## MODEM MADNESS Cont.

"Perhaps we had Detter come back to that part "Oh, Dy the way, sir. I forgot to mention the later. What eise do I need to know about?" protocol."

"Well, sir, We have asynchronous and Dysynchronous, odd and even parity. 7 or 8 bit, sir." If the man had a tail, he would have Deen wagging it like an irrepressible puppy.

"A sin what? Pair of what? Young man, I really must ask you to slow down just a bit. You did say 'bit didn't you?"

"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir."

Eor a moment he looked downcast, as though I had hurt his feelings with my reprimand, but then he beamed once more.

"We can offer you parallel AND serial for your interface, sir."

His look was the triumphant, joyful expression of one who has just been saved from tragedy.

"A pair of L'S and cereal for my inner face? Really. that doesn't sound like something very exciting at all. or are they 'alpha bits?"

My own wil devastated me for several moments as I waited for him to get the joke, but somehow he looked as though he didn't understand. Generation gap, no doubt.

The young salesman steered me to some little Mat plastic Doxes with tiny red lights staring back at me.

"Here we are, sir, the very sest in the business. Needless to say." he paused dramatically for rull effect, "Hayes!" With a sweeping gesture, he took in all the little flat boxes on the sheil.

"Haze?" I saw nothing in the air, Dut at least he knew how I felt. "Dumbfounded" might have said it better.

Ah, now here was something a little more toward my end to things. Protocol was very important in my line of work. It kept people in their proper station in life, maintained the channels of communication as they should be perpetuated, and allowed us to behave as mature adults. Enough of this "Dawd" nonsense. once and for all. A strong. decent protocol--finally, a language I can understand!

He leaned forward conspiratorially, Deckoning a finger. I Dent to hear his whispered utterance.

"Frankly, sir, I know there are a lot of Punter people out there. But you can give me XMODEM any day!"

This was too much. Modems with bawd rates and cereal for inner faces--my friends must have been playing a cruel trick on me. I fled

## ARLINGTON CHAPTER Janet Hamm

Our March meeting was on the 15th at the Arlington Community Center. Thirty computer enthusiasts were in attendance. President, Glen Herring, opened our meeting with a welcome to new members and visitors.

Program director, Herschell Gibbs, introduced our speaker, MCCC President, Harold Williams. Harold presented an interesting and informative program on LIB and ARC utilities. Harold demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of these programs in uploading and downloading files from the bulletin boards

A short business meeting followed. Glen reported the proposals that were before the Board of Directors concerning the Grand Prairie and Ft. Worth Night Chapters. He also announced that the Grand Prairie Chapter would like to merge with our chapter. The monthly meetings would continue to be on the third Tuesday at the same time and place.

Our thanks to James Dunnam for demonstrating the 1987 Tax Survival Kit. This program, available in the club Tibrary, helps you fill out all the tax forms you need; and as we saw in one example, it may even surprise you by printing out a schedule you didn't know you needed!

At our next meeting, we will discuss the use of various combinations of printers, interfaces, and word processors. So if your software isn't on speaking terms with your hardware, we'll try to help you solve the problem. The meeting will be Saturday, April 9, 1:30 p.m., at General Dynamics Recreation Area Bryant-Irvin Road

## GRAND PRAIRIE CHAPTER NEWS Don Bennett

Moved by the MCCC Executive Board decision this month to call for closure of the Grand Prairie Chapter in April, the Chapter voted to approach the Arlington Chapter on a merger of the two chapters. Proposed conditions for the merger were that the combined Chapters:

1) Conduct third Tuesday Evening formal meetings at the Arlington Community Center 2) Conduct second Saturday Afternoon Workshops at the Grand Prairie Public Library 3) Maintain two copies of the Library 4) Form a committee of the two sets of officers to discuss officer positions and possible renaming of the merged chapter 5) Petition the Board to except the merged Chapter rather than persue a forced closure

The Arlington Chapter voted at their March meeting to accept the proposals of the Grand Prairie Chapter and will jointly approach the Board for acceptance at the April Executive Board Meeting.

## AMIGA CENTRAL CHAPTER NEWS Tim Flynn

And a good time was had by all at our March meeting. Leading off the evening, Jack Smith had a collection of rumors and tidbits about future Amiga activity from Commodore Reports of future models made with the 68030 CPU chip should be of particular interest to users. With that kind of power, those IBM PS/2 model 80's won't have anything on us.

The feature presentations of the evening started with a timely lesson by Kerry Batts in using a · tax-preperation template for Maxi-Plan. This is definitely the time of year when we need to take a program like this to heart, even while we wish we didn't need it in the first place.

Software Terminal made two members happy at the meeting with their contribution of RoadWar Europa and a disk organizer program for the door-prizes. Congratulations, folks.

Our second speaker was Bill Keatley, who gave a very interesting demonstration of an Amiga powered with a 68020 chip from CSA. This is the type of third party support that 1s giving the Amiga the type of power and ability formerly found only in machines costing $50,000 or more.

On next month's agenda so far is a presentation of a desk-tap publishing program, which incidently topped the list of personal interests on the survey sheets collected at the March meeting We also hope to have a printer available with the resolution a package like this demands.

So, until next meeting, keep your Amiga happy and the Guru at bay

Where were you on the evening of March 8 at 7:30 pm? Well, those of us who attended the chapter meeting now know how to track the stock market and figure our income taxes using Maxi- Plan (tm). ( And none too soon with April 15 just around the corner. ) Kerry Batts gave another fine demo and told us about some files in the club library that we can use with this spreadsheet in figuring, and 'what-if-ing', income taxes. | think that we should send Kerry on the lecture circuit. He's 2 and 0!

At the Board of Directors meeting on March 9, we had a very long discussion on how to increase our membership and improve services to individual members. In spite of increased interest and growth in the Amiga chapters, our total membership is about 17% less than last year. Many good suggestions came out during the discussion and President Harold Williams appointed a Membership/Publicity committee (Glenn Schneider, Chairman) to follow-up on them. Look for good things to come out of this effort.

The board heard proposals to dissolve the Fort Worth Night and

Grand Prairie Chapters and merge their members into the Fort Worth Day and Arlington chapters, respectively. These proposals were immediately tabled until the April board meeting. Notice of the proposed actions was sent to each member of the chapters affected.
