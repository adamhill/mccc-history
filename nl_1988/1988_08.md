## WHAT'S NEW IN THE WORLD OF SOFTWARE

## FOR THE C-64/128

Cheryl Howard, MCCC

New games on the shelves at Babbage's this month include: cauldron, Road Runner, Alf, Clubhouse Sports, Exaction Fever

Road Runner was tested by Tracy, my 10 year old daughter. This game, remarkably true to the cartoon, has Wile E Coyote chasing the Road Runner through the desext. You, as the Road Runner, must dodge oncoming trucks, stay out from under falling boulders and cannon balls, If that's not enough there are land mines to contend with as you run from Wile E. Coyote. You collect bird seed along the way to increase your energy level. You must pace yourself through this joystick controlled series of mazes and not use up all your energy-which is measured in bowls of seed at the top of the screen. There are hidden short-cuts to advance you to each level of play. This cute game is sure to keep your youngsters occupied. It is interesting and challenging for the 8 to 10 year old age group game player and is easy to figure out.

Cauldron is for the older player-tested by Tiffany, age 14, this disk is actually two games on one disk. Cauldron I is in the front and Cauldron II is on the back of the disk. Ine object of this game is to find the ingredients to the witch's brew. As the witch (or hag) you fly through the forest seeking keys to open doors to caves which contain the ingredients to the magic brews. Now all this sounds easy, but watch out for the bad guys trying to stop you from getting the necessary ingredients. After successfully getting the ingredient you must fly back to the witch's house, leave the ingredient, then leave again in search of another ingredient to add to the brew. All this takes time of course, but don't despair. Tiffany didn't get to complete the game and get to side two to see what Cauldron II was about, but from what observations I made, the game is standard fare fox C-64 games. The concept and style of play is the same as countless games preceding Cauldion. I don't see this game as one for those seeking a serious quest to accomplish. However, it will provide hours of fun for those who like to play computer games for the sake of playing computer games. There is not an element of serious deductive strategy involved here, just good old-fashioned seek and you shall find game playing. Cont. p. 4

## JULY BOARD OF DIRECTORS MINUTES

## John Malmstrom, Secretary

At the July Board meeting (actually held on Jure 25), the major item of business was the unanimous approval of a set of guidelines (budget) for spending by the club and its chapters. Until now there really hasn't been much of a need for a "budget" because there was always enough money to support club activities as long as spending was "prudent." But now, with a somewhat smaller membership spread over more chapters, it's necessary to be a little more careful to avoid a deficit at the end of the year. The guidelines approved by the board are as follows: Disposition of Income

* MCCO Dues --should be earmarked for general club and chapter operations.
* Disk sales -- proceeds should be returned to the club treasury for disposition by the Board of Directors.
* BBS Dues --should be earmarked for BBS operation, supplies and equipment.
* Genexal Budget Items (expressed in cost per member and based on 325 members)

## NEW C-64/128 SOFTWARE CONT.

For all you Alf fans, Box Office has finally released the 6-54 version of their Alf game that has been out for sometime for the Apple and IBM computers. I was disappointed as games fox these computers are usually better constructed and more complex in strategy. since the back of the package shows the screens for the IBM version, I have to assume that all versions are the same. This game was boring to Tracy and she is a devoted Alf fan. The object of the game is to guide Alf through a series of mazes of city streets in the Tanner neighborhood, collecting various parts of a spaceship.

You see, some of Alf's best friends from MeImac have crashlanded their spaceship on Earth and since Melmacians look like dogs, someone has alerted the Dog Catcher and he is out to capture all Alf's buddies. You must guide Alf as he searches for and collects objects to rebuild the spaceship and retum his friends safely to Meimac. Sounds good so fax, that's why I picked up the game. But alas, boredom sets in quickly. You leave the Tanner garage, go find a piece of pizza to eat which will give you the strength to chase down a cat, capture it and take it back to the Tanner garage. After you go through this tedious bit of business you can begin to collect pieces of the spaceship. you must then go through the same sequence (find and eat pizza, collect object, take back to garage, leave in garage, etc.) before you can go on to the next level. While you are doing all this backtracking, you have to watch out for Tanner and the Dog Catcher. If Tanner catches you, you lose everything you have collected and must begin again. If the Dog Catcher catches you, that's it folks, one life down the drain. Lose all three lives, and the game is over--Alf is history. It's a race against Ianner, the Dog catcher, and time as you are racing against a time limit. Just the repetitious backtracking was enough to turn us off to this game the first time we booted it up.

on the other hand, clubhouse sports by Mindscape is a lot of fun. These six stand-alone games are great for those of us who like a leisure game of skeeball or Foosball at the local arcade. Games include skeeball, 3-D pinball, Billiards, shooting Gallery, crazy Pool, and Poosball. Each game is realistic and graphic representation is top quality. When you first boot up you are asked for a User verification code, which amounts to findina the exact

word described in the paragraph on the scieen. Example: Find the ith word in the 10th line of the 2nd column of page 15 of your owner's Manual.) This word must be typed EXACTLY as shown before you can access the games. Up to four players may play at one time. Games are joystick controlled and you have a screen full of options with each game. The nicest feature with · all the games is that the programmers have convinced the computer that it is playing against mere humans (in the one player mode) and that it can't take unfair advantage with it's superior skills. Pach game is realistic and fun to play. The enclosed reference card gives a brief description of each game and the owner's manual goes into more detail. You can sit down and start playing without a lot of pregame reading, but be ready fox a few suprises. Things don't always happen the way you think they should. Lots of good clean fun here, folks--a definite bonus in the Mindscape line.

Pinally, Iracy picked up a program called praction Pever to do a little math review before school starts again. Unfortunately, spinnaker left something to be desired in the way of screen display and some of the screens are hard to decipher. Basically what happens is you are on a pogo stick hopping down the sidewalk. Above you a fractional equation is displayed and as you nop across the moving sidewalk a series circles or blocks is · displayed beneath the sidewalk with some of the circles or blocks shaded in. When you see the display of shaded blocks or circles that matches the fxaction, press the joystick button. If you are correct you advance to the next level; if you are wrong you drop to à lower level. All the time you are racing against a timer. pushing the joystick right or left determines the

direction of travel along the sidewalk as well as the speed in which you travel.. be careful or you will fall off the end of the sidewalk. The concept is good, but this educational game is too fast paced for the younger kids. A seven year old is going to have to be pretty fast on the trigger to avoid falling off the edge.

As far as prices and rating go, I rank clubhouse sports at $25.45 the best this month. Cauldron at $12.70 is next with Road Runner, priced at $29.70, third. Iow on the enjoyment level are Alf at $12.70 and bottom of the ladder is Fraction Fever at $5.90. Last month, I mentioned the variety of game show programs available for under $15. Tiffany has Jeopardy, Card sharks, Wheel of Fortune and Classic Concentration. All are played very similar the game shows using keyboard controls. Tiffany likes Jeopardy and Classic concentration best; I think she has the answers memorized by now. Tracy favors card sharks and Wheel of Fortune (vanna is even included on the disk.) ALI the ganes are entertaining and are better values than some of the higher priced games.

until next month, happy gaming.

## TIME BANDIT-AMIGA

Johnny Kitchens, MCCC

A game of challenge awaits you in the form of "Time Bandits". This game is a surprise as the instructions give no indication of what awaits you inside this game. At first glance the game appears to be a simple run and grab type of game. Jewels, money, and keys scattered about various mazes with various bad guys chasing you. You have a gun with limitless amount of ammo which is good since you also never run out of bad guys no matter where you are. The game also gives you a lot of lives to start out with, but they go fast. You get a new man every 1000 points which are measured in cubits.

You begin to get an idea that there is more than meets the eye after you meet a fem people, stumble upon unusual trings, or read cryptic messages. This game is loaded! Some Time Gates have multiple levels leading to more and more complex problems to solve. There are starships you can pilot, king's crowns to recover, and even a version of Pac-Man. There are 16 Time Gates, each with 16 levels of play. Even those numbers don't tell all the levels. on the first level of one Time Gate you can play up to 5 different screens. Each screen is in reference to a different location. It's incredible!!

"Time Bandits" can be played as a one player or two player game. The two player version will be even harder as the screen splits, making the visible area much smaller and allowing the bad guys to get closer before they are visible. The other player also can become a foe if he enters the same Time Gate on the same level as you are on. He can shoot you or you can shoot him. This will cause the player to become a ghost who can kill with

This game is very fast paced and forces you to keep moving. Take too long to decide on a Time Gate and some flying saucer will carry you off to some place of it's oun choice once inside if you stand still too long your potential points decrease rapidly while the bad guys are increasing rapidly. No time to be indecisive here.

This game came out orginally for the Atari ST under the label Michiron. Releasing the game for the amiga prompted Michtron to rename it's game division to Microdeal, but there are other changes. I showed an Atari owner, who has the game, Time Bandit on the Aniga. He couldn't believe the difference. I havn't seen the differences myself, but they must be different. The disk is copy-protected. MicroDeal offers à $5.00 replacement fox damaged disk for some reassurance. Marauder II does not copy it at tris time. (It may never be able to if the rumors are coxrect.)

If a quick shoot-em up, Pac-Man like maze, and a game of wits is to your liking then this just may be your game. IT IS NOT EASY!!!!!!

Thanks For Reading!!

## Arkanoid

John Shortle

## Reprinted from MI AMIGA

Arkanoid is an arcade remake of the popular coin-op version. If you haven't played this game in the arcade, Arkanoid is the latest in the recent resurgence of pong games. In addition to the usual "Hit the ball with the paddle until all the bricks are gone," Arkanoid boasts many new twists to the old classic. When certain bricks are hit (you don't know which ones), they drop a letter (called a power capsule) to the bottom of the screen. If you catch the power capsule mità your paddle (called a vaus), you receive some sort of bonus to your playing abilities. The bonuses include ‹Slowing the ball dowm, ‹E›xpanding your vaus, "Catching the ball, "D'Isrupting the ball into three separate ones, «I›aser, ‹B'reakout to the next level, and a free ‹P›addle. In addition to the normal colored bricks, there are also brown bricks which can't ever be destroyed, and grey bricks which require several shots (depending on what level you're on) to destroy. Pach level presents a new pattern of bricks to hit down, some in very fiendishly difficult patterns.

The Amiga version of Arkanoid is very true to the arcade version. The graphics and sound effects are identical. have only seen one Arkanoid arcade machine for any length of time, but from what I saw, the aniga version has clearer graphics and a crisper sound. The aniga version does not, however, have the same screens as the arcade version. In fact, they're completely different. This is no problem unless you're looking to play the EXACT arcade version on the Aniga.

Arkanoid is a very playable game. It is fun to play, has enough variety to keep you coming back, and above all, it

"feels nice." The levels are generally challenging enough so that you have fun playing them, but not so much that you are overly frustrated. (one level, however, does bother me particularly. It is quite hard and requires a substantial amount of luck to clear it. just play it on speed 1 - the slowest.) Arkanoid, by nature, was made for a paddle. The mouse is the second best substitute, so it you're using a less than perfect mouse, you may find your vaus not moving when you want it to. A little cleaning work will alleviate the problem easily.

overall, Arkanoid is a great game. I've spent numerous enjoyable hours playing it. The problems I have pointed out are really very minor ones. If you're looking for a good arcade game, Axkanoid is the best I've seen so far.

## Test Drive

John Shortle

## Reprinted from MI AMIGA

Test Drive is a "Pole Position" type gane that allows you "to experience the power and performance of the world's most exclusive cars." These are, according to Accolade, the Perrari Testarossa, the Lotus Turbo Espirit, the Porsche 911 Turbo, the lamborghini countach, and the corvette.. When the game boots, you are given the opportunity to select which of these cars you will race in. (A nice picture of each car is displayed, and when your selection is finally made, the driver colls down the window, looks at you, and burns off the screen.) Now you are in the driver's seat, with a view of the steering wheel, the dash board, the rear view mirrors, and the road ahead. The steering wheel and dash board are different for each of the five cars. You shift into first and accelerate onto the road. (If you rev your engine before shifting, you peel out.) When shifting gears, a picture of the stick shift (different for each car) is pictured in the lower right hand corner. " I must say that this program has given me the best feeling of driving of any game I've ever seen. Now you must avoid the traffic (cars you are passing and oncoming vericles), the cliff to the right of the road, and the drop off to the left. Periodically, a policeman will try to pull you over, and if you're not going fast enough, he will give you a ticket and you will lose precious time. If you make it to the gas station without crashing more than five times, you get extended play. You are then given a score proportional to your speed. However, as with many aniga games, the designers concentrate 50 much on amazing graphics and sound, that they forget to make a tun game. While the game is reasonably fun, there is no depth to keep you coming back. The screen is always the same (a cliff drive). They actually have a different drive on the back of the package, but I have never seen it, and I don't know anyone who has. While the extended play gets progressively harder, the game ends after the fourth extended play (fifth level), and since you only have to crash four times or less to get extended play, I almost always finish the game. overall, the graphics and feel of the game are awesome. However, it you're looking for a fun, challenging gane, this game is not for you. The package is just what it says it is - a test drive.
