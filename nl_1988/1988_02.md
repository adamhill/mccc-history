## Do I NEED A HOME COMPUTER?

PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME 'WHY DO YOU NEED A HOME COMPUTER?, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A HOME COMPUTER?". I'M USUALLY A LITTLE AMAZED THAT OWNING A HOME COMPUTER REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION, TELEVISIONS, VCRS, RADIOS, SEWING MACHINES AND MICROWAVES EXIST WITHOUT DEMANDING JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR PLACE IN THE HOME. THESE DEVICES ARE MUCH LIKE HOME COMPUTERS, THEY HAVE PRACTICAL VALUE AND THEY CAN BE ENTERTAINING, THE TV, RADIO AND VCR CAN BE USED TO KEEP US INFORMED AND EDUCATED, BUT ALSO PROVIDE PURE ENTERTAINMENT, YOU CAN COOK A MEAL WITH A MICROWAVE OVEN BUT YOU CAN ALSO MAKE CHEESE DIP OR POP POPCORN, SEWING MACHINES SERVE BASICALLY A PRACTICAL PURPOSE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT FIND GREAT ENJOYMENT IN SEWING AND TREAT SEWING MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER HOBBY. A HOME COMPUTER IS WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE. A COMPUTER CAN BE A VERY PRACTICAL TOOL AND A SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT,

MY HOME COMPUTER HAS BEEN USED TO WRITE LETTERS, PREPARE MY INCOME TAXES, CREATE PERSONALIZED GREETING CARDS, AND MAINTAIN CLUB MEMBERSHIP LISTS, WHEN I WAS A TEACHER 1 USED MY COMPUTER TO DESIGN POP QUIZES, DAILY ASSIGNMENTS, AND EXAMS, 1 TOOK A CUBU PROGRAMMING CLASS AT UTA. WHILE MOST OTHER STUDENTS WERE DRIVING TO THE UNIVERSITY TO WRITE PROGRAMS I WAS AT HOME WITH MY COMPUTER CONNECTED TO THE SCHOOL COMPUTER BY TELEPHONE. MY CHILDREN HAVE USED MY COMPUTER TO HELP THEM WITH SPELLING, MATH FACTS, MEMORIZING THE CAPITALS OF THE 50 STATES AND I'VE CALLED ON-LINE ENCYCLOPEDIAS TO GET INFORMATION FOR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS, I CONTINUE TO FIND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR MY COMPUTER,

MY HOME COMPUTER IS ALSO AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER, ARCADE GAMES, FAMILY GAMES, TRIVIA GAMES, ROLE PLAYING GAMES, AND INTERACTIVE FICTION ARE ALL ENJOYED ON MY COMPUTER, BUT ENTERTAINMENT GOES BEYOND GAMES, I ENJOY COMPUTER MUSIC AND GRAPHIC DISPLAYS, 1 ALSO ENJOY PROGRAMMING AS A HOBBY,

POR MICROWAVE NO A SERING MACHINE THINK I DO... THE SAVE WAY I NEED A TV, RADIO,

## C-64 EMULATOR FOR AMIGA

By John Boyce, LACC

For those of you who have been thinking of upgrading to an Amiga but have reluctant to do so because you didn't want to have to replace your entire software collection, fret no more. There are now IWO C-64 emulators for the Amiga line of computers. The better of these, in my opinion, is by Ready Soft and sells for $59.95 retail, including cables to connect your Amiga to a 1541, 1571, 1581 or other C-64 compatible disk drive. The C-64 emulator broadens the horizons of Amiga owners with access to thousands of programs written for word processors, databases, spread sheets and games you have grown to love and cherish can now be run on an Amiga. The program is written 100% in 68000 machine code to maximize speed, and although some loss in program is evident, monochrome mode wil) turn off the color and increase speed. All aspects of your - 64 are supported, including sound and color. Additionally, all Amiga disk drives and printers are fully supported, and moving your C - 64 programs to Amiga disks is a snap.

With the C-64 emulator now a reality, and the Amiga 500 (with a 512K RAM and internal 880K disk drive) retailing for the exact same price as the C - 64 initially retailed for, and nearly 1000 conmercial programs currently available for the Amiga..

## A HELPFUL HINT FOR BEGINNERS

(or reminder for old hands)

"I've got this real great program, but I can't seem to remember where I got it or just how to use it. I've spent the hour going through all the saved articles and old magazines in my collection and still can't find out anything about program. What do I do now??"

Could this be you talking? Have you ever heard yourself saying something like that? I'll tell you an easy way to keep these words from ever being uttered by you again!

Upon entering aprogram into your computer for saving and later use, try entering some "REMARK" lines at the be ginning or end of your program that contain pertinent information as to where you got it and how to use it. You don't have to carry on and on with REMARK lines - in fact it's best not to use too many just use enough to jog your memory or help someone not familiar with how the program works. Maybe you could name the magazine or book or other source AND give the date of issue and the page number. I is best to use a couple of "REMARK" lines at the beginning of a listing to tell where it originated and that more information can be found at the end of the listing. As I say, that is my preference. Do your own thing, believe me, "REMARK"' lines are important and can save · you from a lot of frustration.

Your thoughts, when you spend an evening programming, or typing in a program from a magazine, are that you will never forget where you got it or how to use it - - - NOT SO - - - Iry loading a program you typed in months ago and haven't used since, and you'll see what I mean! This

Cont.

is such a simple solution . to a common problem.

SUGGESTION: On some dull evening when you don't know what to do (you're PACMAN'd out - the KLINGONS have zapped you 14 times in a row - you can't get on the darn BBS you don't have anyone to make a PRINTSHOP birthday card for - you've read all 8 of the computer magazines you subscribe to - but that cute little blonde cursor keeps flirting with you with its constant "come hither" winking), don't throw the switch and go to bed - - take that time to load some of your programs and add "REMARK" lines as memory joggers; then, re-save them with the SAVE"@O: filename", 8 command. YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!

(Ed. Note: This is an excellent suggestion, which I certainly wish I had followed from the beginning. I agree with Lloyd that you should put most of your REMs at the end of a BASIC program. The reason is that BASIC has to read all the way through to get to what it's supposed to do. That slows it down even more. That's why you usually see instructions and other one-time- only program lines at the end of the program.)

## BEGINNER'S BASIC

By John Byhoffer, Ventura, CA

## PEEK &amp; POKE

Manipulating the contents of memory locations inside a computer is one of the major functions of writing programs. This is how you get the computer to do the things you want it to do. The two statements we are covering this month, PEEK &amp; POKE, do just that.

The POKE command is used in Commodore BASIC to change the contents of a memory location. An address in the computer's RAM memory which performs a certain function can be changed by "inserting" specific number in that location which will cause it to · do something else. Input/Output registers can also be modified using this statement. Addresses in the computer's ROM (Read Only Memory) cannot be changed with this statement (but they can be Read using PEEK, which we'll get to shortly).

The word POKE is ALWAYS followed by two parameters, i. e., the memory location itself and the number (value) that is to be put there. These are separated by a comma. The numeric value in the memory location range is O to 65535. The value that can be put there can be between 0 and 255. Examples of the POKE statement might be:

POKE 1024,19 - Put the letter "s" in the first screen position

POKE 55296,0 - Change the color of the same location

to black.

POKE 53280, 1 - Change the border color to white.

POKE 649,0 - Disable the key- board (C64 only).

POKE 775,200 - Disable the LIST command

Variables can be used in place of the two parameters mentioned above if desired. This sometimes helps to conserve memory, and makes programming easier in some cases. Some examples might be:

POKE A,B : POKE Z+N,A : POKE C,X+(N*2)

Please refer to your Programmer's Reference Guide or System Guide for more information on this statement.

Not only will PEEK tell you what value is held in a particular memory location, but it can also be used as the numeric argument of statement. Some examples of the PEEK statement might be:

- 10 PRINT PEEK (53280) AND 15 - Returns value of screen border color.
- 40 7% = PEEK (65408) - Variable Z represents the Kernal number.
- 200 POKE H, PEEK (C-2) - POKEs memory location H with value of the contents
- of memory location C-2.
- 25 IF PEEK (646)=0 THEN POKE 53281,1 - If character color is black, then change screen color to white.

The use of these two statements in BASIC requires, of course, a knowledge of the internal memory addresses of your computer and what function they perform. The best place to learn this information is from a C64 or C128 memory map.

## RAINBOW PAINTER

By Lloyd F. Warren, Fresno, CA

Do you remember what fun it was to color pictures in coloring books when you were young? I have even seen some complex drawings just for adults to color, which proves that just about everyone loves to use coloring books. Would you like to return to those thrilling days of yesteryear when you could completely lose yourself with a coloring book and a box of crayons? Well then, I've got just the computer program for you!

"Rainbow Painter" is more than a coloring book and box of crayons. It can help develop confidence, motor skills creativity while providing loads of fun. The following sentence is an excerpt from the user's manual: "It is targeted at such a wide age group because the drawing capabilities offer simplistic ease of drawing and coloring for the novice and at the same time, offer challenging graphic tools for the experienced artist."

After loading the program, you are presented with a graphic menu consisting of 10 categories of line drawings, ox you may create your own pictures in a variety of styles. Each of the 10 categories; animals, vehicles, flowers, birds, space, seasons, sea life, mirrors, tales and dinosaurs are made up of 5 different drawings - 50 unique pictures. You choose a category, and then a drawing, by using the joystick.

The program is icon-driven, which makes it very user friendly. Once you have chosen a picture, you can start coloring, again using the joystick, and a menu of over one hundred colors and patterns. There is also an option offered for creating your own colors. Cont.

## RAINBOW PAINTER

Cont.

One of the nice things about coloring a picture using "Rainbow Painter" is that it doesn't allow you to go over the lines, and if you don't like the color you used, you can erase it (only the last color used can be erased) or you can "trash" the whole picture and start again. You couldn't do that with a coloring book! You can be as creative as you like - how about a pink elephant or a green sky or a yellow bluejay? Have you ever wondered what a red and green checkered snowman would look like? Now is your chance to see.

The drawing mode of the program allows you to draw your own pictures, circles, boxes, straight lines, broken lines, etc. You can pick from a selection of 50 different size and shape crayons. The possibilities are almost endless, and you can "save" anything you create to a data disk.

CONCLUSION: On a scale of l to 10 (10 being best) I give "RAINBOW PAINTER" an overall rating of 10t.

RATING THE PROGRAM BY SELECTED FEATURES'

GRAPHICS - 10 - The drawings axe well done with a large range of subjects.

JOYSTICK INPUT - 10 - It is a pleasure to sit back, watch the screen and manipulate a joystick rather than keep searching the keyboard for input keys.

SPEED OF OPERATION - 8 - It is slightly slow at times due to having to access the disk for some options.

SOUND - 7 - Sound is used to advise you that the joystick fire button has been pressed. This is a nice touch. It is just a quick "beep" and can be eliminated by turning the monitor volume down.

COLORS - 10 - There are many choices: solid bright colors, pastel shades, patterns such as building bricks, lines, stripes, checkerboards, plus the ability to create your own colors. The selection is endless.

ON-SCREEN DIRECTIONS - 10 - The icons make it very easy to move from one option to another via the joystick.

INSTRUCTION MANUAL - 7 - It is fairly easy to use but could be expanded when explaining the creation of your own color patterns.

This is definitely a "fun" program, but it also can be a learning tool for the young person. My 10 year old grandson and main "tester", Jake, likes it a lot and has done some excellent coloring along with some, to say the least, fax-out creations! He has even enlightened me as to some of the capabilities of 'the program. He gives it an unqualified thumbs up.

"RAINBOW PAINTER" is a product of Springboard Software Inc. ard can be found in mail order catalogs for $18. 95 (a good buy!).

## BOB'S TERMPRO

By Bob Sackett, SOCK

BobsTerm Pro C64 ($59.95) C128 ($79.95) Progressive Peripherals &amp; Software 2186 South Holly, Suite #2 Denver, Colo. 80222 - 303-759-5713

Telecommunications programs are funny items: price has little or nothing to do with quality. Some of the best programs I have are either public domain "freeware", by authors asking only a. small donation to keep them in disks. I refer to such Super programs as NEZTERM V9.0, PROTOTERM 128 and PHXBOOT 128 to be found on QUANTUM-LINK. PROTOTERM even includes, in its download, a complete user's manual. to send to your printer. They do just about everything you are likely to do on the telephone, if you are the average user.

On the other hand, after you get to using some of the systems available over the phone, you start to get hooked. What else capabilities of PARINER 128's Memo pad to is possible? How could that be done just a bit easier? Wouldn't it be nice if the computer handled a few of the mundane chores regularly run into, such as autodialing, log - on and automatic downloads and saves to disk? Like word processors, telecommunication programs can get as elaborate as you can stand. It's like comparing the editing those of PERFECT WRITER in all its glory. Both serve their purpose; you have to decide what you want.

If you want everything, look for BobsTerm Pro. There probably are other things telecom program could do, but I can't think of any off hand. It has all the transfer protocols, (Xmodem, Punter, CompuServe B, CRC) and will format and transfer CP/M materials. It wil] emulate several of the more common big system terminals: VI-100, VI- 52 and ADM-31. It works at speeds from 50 to 2400 baud and has a buffer size of 60K (28.5K in the C=64 version.) Buffer size is the amount of space you can take in over the phone before you are "full" and need to save it to a disk.

A1] popular modems, including the early and late 1660, are compatible. You can upload data from keyboard or disk; downloads may go to disk, printer or screen. Partia] dumps, either way, are possible. Editing is elaborate. Insert and delete are set by range; conversion can be done between cases, ASCII-PETSCII, and Sequential - Program. Many functions are available by using the logo (C=) key followed by the function. (C=) B, for example, opens and closes the buffer. Full and Half duplex is chosen by (C=) (for Echo).

Macros may be developed to your heart's content. A macro is a set of characters that is stored and sent by merely pushing one button, or when your computer recognizes a prompt from the host system. For example, you could store your CompuServe ID and code in a macro and cause them to be sent when asked for by the Compuserve computer, without you having to do anything. You can even turn your computer into a mini-bulletin board, having it answer the phone and allowing outside control by those on your system with the right password.

BobsTerm Pro, written by Bob Lentini, is Oil an unprotected disk, but requires a dongle be inserted in joystick port #2 to. run, one of the better means of authorprotection.

Auto-redial is available for those busy systems, and split-screen is used to allow you to be composing your answer to questions while they are still coming in. A real - time clock, as well as a stopwatch, is operational. Many more functions of greater or lesser demand are there. Like I said, it has everything.

You may not need, or want everything. BobsTerm Pro is not a program to use once a month, or sO. You need to become tamiliar with it to appreciate its value. The manual is complete and easy to read, but you won't get through it in an hour. This is the program you want to stay with until you die, like your favorite word processor. Once you get to know it, you won't want another.

We just received a new auto menu program for the C - 128 users. It is not a very pretty program, but it works great and it has all you really need in a menu program. It can be used for both 40 or 80 columns. It is a shareware type of written by Kevin Hisel (also wrote Diskwhiz). When you first run the program, it gives you the choice of drives and devices. So, you can use it choose the drive you want, it loads the programs and display on the top line the with more than one disk drive. After you following...

- 1 - Disk name and ID number
- 2 - Format (single or double sided disk )

3 - Blocks free

You — Reply, Forward, Save, Delete

Choose the program you want to run by moving the cursor to the name of the program and hitting the return key, it's that easy. You may also read or sequential files by loading the file like you did on the regular programs. Talk about a handy little program ....... While the cursor is on the program or sequential file, it displays the : length of that file. An added option: While the cursor is on "next page" and you hit return, it will show you another menu:

- 1 - See new disk
- 2 - Restart this disk

3 - Quit

The first option allows you to check several disks for the one you want without re - loading the menu program. · · · So, if you are looking for a good menu program for your C - 128, 1ook for "DIRECTORY 128" on a special C - 128 disk that will be ready to start the new year right. Happy computing in 1988.

## FONIMASTER 128

## By Ed McCormick, SFVCUG

FONIMASTER 128 by XETEC is one of the most exciting programs I've come across. The printouts done with the program intrigue me to no end. There are so many uses they can be put to. Each document can have up to nine fonts. They can be expanded or made double height or half height. It's really up to your creativity as to how far you can go in getting handsome print outs.

Three-block PRINI SHOP graphics can be converted into the FONTMASTER format. Hires graphics from DOODLE can be converted, as well as graphics from FLEXIDRAW. There is a peculiarity with DOODLE graphics; about one-third of the picture is moved to the opposite side of the graphic. You frame what you want converted and hit return. I have another conversion program that works the same way. It must have something to do with the DOODLE format.

As it is a graphic program, it takes a while to make printouts. I've had to accept the fact, and I'm beginning to be able to live with it; however, for getting a quick printout, you can use the dot-matrix mode. This would be the same as using your other processors. When you set up your printer properly, which is quite easy, many of the printer format commands that you included in your document will be recognized when using the dot-matrix mode. You can also give additional commands to your printer that you may not have had use for in your Font

There is a Translator mode that allows you to convert files from other word processors. It's all done with very little effort. It was easy to use a sequential file made while using CONSULTANT and then loaded into FONTMASTER when printing a form letter. It was a first for me, and as I'm not too jaded yet, it was a thrill seeing the results.

Up to four columns can be printed on one page without too much difficulty. F1, macroS. A and f/ Macross cay Which can foe programmed to represent up to 64 keystrokes. This can save time if a phrase is used often in a document, or it could be used when printing labels. It was return used here to move some information about as the buffer was too full (making a block and then moving it, would be the normal way of moving text). The memory used to hold the fonts is at the same location as the buffer.

In the August issue of RUN, there is a review of several word processors. The reviewer thought FONIMASTER 128 was an excellent program, objections. He objected to area at the top of the screen as being too busy and not being needed. I've used the program long enough now that I've come to rely on it for information needed at the moment. It informs you what is happening at the position of the cursor, such as which column and line you're on, whether you're in the insert mode, etc. It names the font at that point and shows an example of it. It tells you how many characters per inch and shows the height (tall, normal, micro) of the character. ) It gives the title of the document. This is also the area that is used for help screens. He points out that it doesn't take advantage of the COMMODORE EXPANSION CARTRIDGE, as do FLEET SYSTEM 4 and the POCKET 2 SERIES, which would be a terrific feature. Also it doesn't word wrap on the screen; it does in the print out, however. This isn't being written as a comparison of other programs; I'm just sharing my enthusiasm with you.

protection, FONTMASTER 128 uses cassette port key. You plug it directly into the computer. There's no need to plug and unplug it, as the interface for your printer is stacked on top of the key. (CCCC Ed. Note: Assuming you have an unmodified interface that draws power from the computer through the cassette port- I bought a Mw 350 to use with the Canon

PJ1080A printer because the MW 350 offered a game port plug just like a joystick plug instead of that awful gadget that comes unsoldered at the unhandiest moments.) I prefer this arrangement the one BATTERIES INCLUDED uses, which plugs into the game port.

You have complete control of line spacing, as well as control of the amount of space (microgaps) you use between characters.

There are several good fonts and a number that you would most likely never use. Some are too small, which makes it difficult to read them unless you use the tall mode. (Some are such things a mirror Toreont controlling the format. over /0 instructions

Documents can be saved as program and/or with other word processors. After you save sequential files, which means flexibility a program file, the modifiers and formatter commands can be removed and then saved as a sequential file.

Video preview is a way of examining your work. It's a read-out on the screen of

WYSIWYG--what you see is what you get. It includes the graphics.

The system setup is well worked out, covering just about every printer and interface you can think of. The first thing you want to do after making a backup of the master disk is set your system. In the lower right hand corner of the screen is a grade scale for your setup. Fortunately for me, my SG-10 with the Xetec Super Graphix interface gets a perfect score. Every command that's in the program works for me. There's no messing around hoping something will work...it works 100 percent.

Materials can be moved from one document to another. As I mentioned earlier, if the buffer is used up, save it as a macro, then unload it where you need it. idea either to erase the fonts or not loa them until you're ready for a printout.

While working on a document, it's a good That way you have plenty of room in the buffer for storing information. Cont.

One last thing to make life easier. When it comes time to do a printout, make certain that a copy of the article, fonts and the graphics are on the same disk. Also, a program called "U.NORMAL" must be on the disk, or you can't do a successful video preview. In the manual on page two, it instructs you about including this program, but I missed it and had to write XETEC about it. I'm happy to say that I received a prompt reply.

(Ed. Note: This seems to be the leading choice for word processors for user group newsletters, as it is easy to understand since most editors have to produce their own graphics, too. As far as I know, the only other word processors with this kind of graphics import capability are Prowrite for the Amiga and next year's Word Perfect 5.0 for MS-DOS and Amiga..

(MCCC Ed. Note: A Spell Master program is available by mail from XETEC for $10. Included are update program and supplemental font disks.)

## PROGRESSIVE PERIPHERALS for the AMIGA

## LCUG

PIXmate ($69. 95) - This is "truly professional image enhancement softwar. My impression is that it is much like "Butcher" in that it will convert graphics FROM any mode and resolution TO any mode and resolution including HAM and EHB. In addition, it will do four color separations and gray scaling.

IntroCAD ($79.95) - This is a nice, entry - level CAD program.

UltraCAD (price TBA) - This is a "complete accounting system designed especially for the AMIGA." It is fully integrated (general ledger, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.) Available first quarter 1988.

EXP - 512 ($169. 95) - It would appear that this is just the Progressive Peripherals version of the 'slow - fast' RAM 512K memory addition that you can get from CBM as well..

EXP - 1000 (price TBA) - This adds 1 megabyte of true fast RAM to the A500 (internally ). "EXP - 512 compatible"

EXP - 8000+ (price TBA) - This is a memory expansion unit for the A500. It comes with 2 megs on board, expands to 8 megs, has an optional 68010 and 68881 and fits INSIDE the A500 (This I have to see!)

![Image](1988_02_artifacts/image_000010_c1c0ad70e278e4bc7f72a116bb5bb9e4115109ecbbdfdd8c78a677b702584ad5.png)

PRODRIVE ($239.95) - This is nice! It is an external 3.5" floppy drive for all the AMIGAS. It is fully compatible with the A -1010 (the one we are all using now) but it is about 400% smaller! It makes essentially NO noise. It has a spring loaded metal door that closes the case when there is no disk in the thing. It is all metal and HEAVY so it won't slide around when you're trying to insert a disk. It has a 27" cable so you can put it on either side of the machin(s). FCC approved (and it is SMALL).

Access 64($79. 95) - "Access 64 is NOT another C - 64 emulator." What this does is allow you to use your G - 64/128 peripherals as AVIGA ¡ardware devices (!) It is "totally transparent". "You or your program can address the COMMODORE serial printer as PRT:, your 1541, 1571, and 1581 disk drives become DF8: or DF9:. Access 64's special utility software also lets you transfer your valuable C - 64 and C 128 word processing files and other date to your AMIGA."

Framegrabber ('under $500') - This is a video digitizer that you use to 'grab' images from video and store them in the AMIGA as IFF or RAW RB data. Where this differs from current versions is in the fact that it is a separate box. It has it's own 350K+ RAM where the image is captured. The data is THEN sent to the AMIGA via the parallel port 8FAST19. The image can be processed software (on the AMIGA) and it can be adjusted before you capture the image via three knobs on the front of the box (intensity, hue, and color). The actual 'grab' takes place in one video FIELD (1/60 second) for B &amp; W imaging and in one video FRAME (1/30 second) for color. You can see what you will get displayed on the AMIGA monitor at all times prior to the actual 'grab'. You view it in HAM mode. They also support HAM overscan. A rice product. I WAS impressed.

AMIGA

Tim Flynn

The January meetings at both locations featured · very interesting demonstration of two of the most popular AMIGA word processors: Scribble and Word Perfect. Our thanks to Rick Schulz and Jack Smith for the excellent presentations.

Beginning in February, each of our meetings will feature a different program. The North Richland Hills meeting will be run by a committee consisting of Rick Schulz, Jody Reimers, Bruce Nelson, Gary Campbell, and Brent Wood. Their efforts will make a separate program possible.

In February, the North Richland Hills meeting will feature a Midi and music demonstration. If you have never seen music performed on an AMIGA attached to a keyboard, you're in for a treat. Amy can really rock! The meeting will be held on the second Tuesday of the month, as usual, February 9th, at 7:30p.m. at the North Richland Hills Recreation Center - the southeast corner of Rufe Snow and 820.

The Arlington meeting for February will feature a presentation by Microbotics. Microbotics is a hardware developer for the AMIGA. They will be talking about, and possibly demonstrating, some of their latest offerings. It should be well worth seeing. This one will be held the third Thursday of the month, February 18th at 7:30p.m. at the Arlington Community Community Center - Matlock Road, one mile north of 120.

## FT. WORTH DAY

## Mary Louise Hagemeyer

Our thanks goes to Okley Moss for our January presentation. It was interesting to hear about the BBS from the SYSOP'S point of view.

In February. Harold Williams will demonstrate the following powerful utilities: LIBRARY, ARC, and SDA (self-dissolving archives - which is not as sinister as it sounds). These programs may be used with the BBS for downloads or in organizing our own files.

Our February meeting will be Saturday, the thirteenth at 1:30p.m. in room 1, across the back hall from our former room, of the General Dynamics Recreation Center, located on Bryant Irvin Road

## ARLINGTON

## Janet Hamm

Our first meeting in 1988, on Tuesday, the nineteenth, began with an interesting and entertaining program by Herschel Gibbs, Jr. Herschel explained and demonstrated how he put together a "sing-a-long" program. We all joined in some sing-s-longs.

MCCC president, Harold Williams, explained the club's new system for collecting dues and gave some helpful hints to new members for using the BBS.

Dick Headley, treasurer, reminded us to pay our dues for the new year.

We were glad to see new members in attendance. We encourage all new users to come, join, and participate in the activities.

At our next meeting, Bob Krause, from the Ft. Worth Day Chapter, will challenge us with the question, . "Where is Carmen San Diego?" Hope to see a good turn out to solve the mystery. See you February 16th, 6:30p.m. in the Garden Room of the Arlington Community Center - Matlock Road, one mile north of 1-20.

EXECUTIVE MEETING MINUTES

John Malmstrom, Secretary

The MCCC Constitution states that action taken by the Board of Directors shall be reported to the membership in the monthly newsletter following such action. Here is what happened the Board meeting on January 2, 1988:

- 1 President Harold Williams announced that the vote taken at the December club meeting was overwhelmingly in favor of proposed constitution changes and declared that we are now operating under the revised constitution.
- 2 The board approved the purchase of a new Star NX - 1000 printer to be used by the newsletter editor. The old printer wil] be placed in semi - retirement with the club librarian.
- 3 The board unanimously approved a revised dues structure. Instead of dues being prorated to expire on December 31, we will now collect dues at at the same yearly rate (S20. 00 for club membership $12. 00 additional for membership), but the memberships wil] expire one year after they are paid. This will smooth out the income during the year and help alleviate the year end crunch that we have had in the past. The board also approved a shorter term membership (6 months) at the rate of $12. 00 The expiration date of membership is now printed on the address label. If it appears incorrect, please Jet me know.
- 4 To accommodate members who wish to get out of the holiday season dues cycle, the board also approved a one - time opportunity to renew their membership for 18 months at $30.00.
- 5 To honor Barbara Cramer for her many years of outstanding service to the club as newsletter editor, the board voted to suspend her membership dues for one year and present a plaque of appreciation.
