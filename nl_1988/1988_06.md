## COMMODORE PARTNERS' PROGRAM

Bill Raecke, MCCC

Many of us have been helping to sell Commodore products for years As part of a new relationship which Commodore plans to institute between Itself and its authorized user groups, Max Toy, President and CEO of Commodore Business Machines, has informed us of a new Partners promotion It is a way for all of us to cash in on what we have been doing for years now anyway

For eech Amige 2000 that a member of an official Commodore User Group helps sell between now and the end of July, 1988, he or she will receive $200 in "Commodore Credits". For an Amige 500, the emount of Commodore Credits" will be $50

## Here is the way It works:

2. When your friend gets ready to purchase the Amiga, obtain a form from the club. These will only be provided on an as-needed basis as they are in rather short supply. You may contact Harold Williams (483-0537), Bill Racke (465-2014), or John Malmstrom (282-6158) for a copy of the form Please note that these are multiple part forms and cannot be duplicated
1. In order to participate, you must be a member of the club
3. Fill out the member portion of the form
4. Accompany your friend to an authorized Amige dealer
6. Return the completed form to the person you got it from along with a copy of the sales ship and the warranty card
5. After your friend purchases his machine, he or she will complete the buyer portion of the form. The store manager will then verify the purchase by completing that portion of the form
7. The form will be verified and returned to Commodore
8. Certificates for the appropriate amount of Commodore Credits will be mailed directly to each participating member in September You will then make out your order form and return it and the certificate (along with a certified check for the balance due, if any) to Commodore. Cont. p. 3

## NEWS ARTICLES AND REVIEWS

1 want to thank ell the members who have written and/or contributed articles and revievs to the MCDC NEWS. Please continue Nothing pleases me more than to have our newsletter articles written by our members. I would like to see our AMIGA users have more input. So, please get with it and let us hear from you!!! Vanessa

## SOUTH CENTRAL COMMODORE SHOW

## Edward L. Wilson III. Show Chairman

As I write this, we are in the hectic middle of parcelling out tables as exhibitors send in their registrations and copy far the show catalog and brochure. We will be having workshops and seminars on Desktop video, professional video programming in various lenguages, Desktop publishing demonstrations of what real people are doing with their computers spreed over two days. We are expecting such folks as Aventarded Benchmatrit NewTek, Brown-Waugh, Gald Technologies and others on June 1T

in addition, we will be having get togethers with user group folks from all over the area to share our experiences and Took for ways we can further cooperation and have fun with new and old friends around the region,

The Tist of activities we'll be having at the show 15 pretty ambitious for a user group. None of it would be possible without the access to INFOMART and its facilities afforded by SCOPE's participation in the Camputer Council of Dallas. Without this access, we simply would not be able to afford the deposit required to rent an exhibit hall. Exhibita by retatlers, hardware and software manufacturers are the backbone of the show. Also important has been the cooperation of user groups such as MCCC in getting the word out to folks all over the region.

## PARTNERS Cont, from p. 1

- You may not combine or transfer credits between members
10. The User Group President in each of the four Commodore Sales arees Whose group recetves the mast Commadore Credits will be the guest of Commodore at the Fall Comdex in Las Yegas

That's the promotion package. Sounds to me Tike a good deal for everyone And I think Commodore deserves a round of applause for their recognition of User Groups as a driving farce in the marketplace first through their Amige software deal last year and now through this promation. I dont know of any other company which hes supported user groups to this extent, It's nice to be appreciated. Now let's get out there and sell those Amigas!

11. The member who receives the most Commodore Credits will also be the guest of Commodore at the Fall Cordex and will also be awarded 500 softvare titles for the Amiga at a special presentation.

## WHAT'S NEW IN THE WORLD OF C-64/128 SOFTWARE

Cheryl Howard, MCDC

This manth, let's take a look at some equipment alang with software now on sale at Babbage's.

Cinemeware Corporation, producers of interactive mavies for computers, presents WARP SPEED by Alten Technologies, Inc This is not a new space adventure as the name might impiy, but a great new fast loed cartridge for both the C-64 AND the C-128. that's right, It works on both systems, all it takes 19 the flip of e switch

This nifty little cartridge has many features the ever popular FAST LDAD by Epys does not have. with the fast load/save/verify, DOS wedge, you have several utility commands, e copter which uses one or two disk drives, a machine language monitor and sector editor. Another nice feature is the Disk Auto Menu which ellows you to load the directory of a disk, cursor the highlight bar down to the program you want and load that program with the press of a key. In the copier modes, if the View Directary" option is chosen from the sub-menu, the system reads the directary from both drive 8 and drive 9

How many times have you wanted to print a text file or 'Reed Me file without having to load up your word processor? Warp Speed's screen dump allows you to do Just that. There is even an "un-nev" commend to restore Besic programs after a new command or after using the reset button located on the top of the cartridde A twelve page manual comes with the cartridge that 1s very informative although it helps to have hed previous expertence with a fast Toad type cartridge. This cartridge was tested on both a C=64 and on a 128 and worked equally well. I was so impressed that I bought it. It will work with about 59% of the software on the market today

For you "BREAKDUT" fens, Mindscape has released "BLOCKBUSTER". As you enter the game, you find yourself trapped in a myriad of walls which you must destroy one brick at a time. Sometimes aliens generally get in your way But on the good side, purchase weapons to help break down the brick wall After you destroy the first wall, you only have 79 more to go After every 10 screens, pesswords fall from the sky to deflect your shots and just special tokens are released occasionally to be used to appear If you memorize them and type one in at the start of the game, you can jump to more advanced

screens. There is also a built in Screen Designer to design up to 48 of your own personal screens.

This program is not for adventure buffs, as it is not taking you on a quest, however anyone looking for a good "Pinball" type program will love it!

On a negative note, l was quite disappointed with Cinemaware's "THREE STOOGES." The opening credits were excellent and the voices of Larry, Curly and Moe were authentic, but once you get pass thet, the game itself is BORINGH! Once you throw a few pies, slap each other around, and race through the hospital one gurney, there just tant anything else going for this program except the name.

Since | Tike to close on a positive nate, for all you computerists wanting to improve you typing, consider "MAVIS BEACON TEACHES TYPING". I only hed this program for a short while and didn't get to completely go through all the options, but was very impressed by what I did get to do. This is not an arcade game typing program, although she does include a game of sorts. You are in a classroom atmosphere with excellent 2D and 3D graphics. Each lesson is analyzed and you work on your weakness instead of sitting down typing endless phrases and trying to shoat down metears. There is a metroname to help you type in an even rhythm and a clock for timed typing. The game option has you driving down the highway typing the letters that appear in the sky in frant of you. The object is to simply stayin front of the car behind you. This is an excellent program which takes you from beginning through advanced typing.

As the mavie critics would say- -on a scale of 1 (Bad) 10(Excellent), Warp Speed rates · 10, Blockbuster - -8, Three Stooges - - 2, and 1 Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing-- 10

Until Next Month--

## About the MCCC BBS Okley Moss, MCCC SYSOP

MCCC has in operation two Bulletin Boards. One is so called the Graphic or CMS Board, Which allows the drawing of color pictures while off line and then sending them to the board. It is basically used by 64 users and 128 users in 64 mode. E-mail, message base, reference files as well as and download files available. It requires a speciel terminal program that Togs you on with a password that you don't have to worry about it also scratches the old and writes a new password each time you access the board, making it almost impossible that someone ather than official users can log on the system. This system offers 300/1200 bed and Punter Protocol downloading. Il maintains a metro number 268-4196 and is in operation 24 hours 7 days per week. It has been in operation almost 3 years. it currently is running about 8 calls per day Give it a call and heip keep it active.

The other board is generally referred to as ASCI and 1s available to all computers using a terminel program of your choice in ASCIl mode. it supports XMODEM in vertous styles as well as Kermit. It has a much larger base for uploads and downloads, E-mail, message base and reference You maintain your own password and are able to change it as desired. It 1s 300/1200/2400 baud and maintains a metro number: 268-4191 and 15 aperational 24 hours 7 days per week it has been in operation about 18 months.

There are currently 154 subscribers and about 6 percent users on the Graphic board and 20 per cent on the ASCIl board on a datly log. The cost of operation for both boards is about $85.00 per manth for telephone and electricity. We have some excellent Asst. SYSOPS to help: Bill Raecke, Williams and Malmstrom Remember what you dant use you could lose, so load up your favorite terminal and give the boards a call! Show us that it is montes well spent.

## THE MCCC LIBRARY DISK CATALOGER Tong Yelez, MCCC Librarian

· have been asked by several people, how to use the MCCC library disks so that they can choose the disies they went copied while at home before they attend their chapter meetings. Since this will save time and insure that you will get the disks you want I will explain how to use the cataloger program to view the directories on the library disks. There are several different things you can use the cataloger program for but 1 Will cover only whet you need to know to view the directories

Get a copy of one of the library disks (for example *5) put it in your disk drive (this pom can only be used with a c-64) Toad and run the cataloger pgm which is the first one on the disk The first screen you see asks for a secondary printer address but you can disregard it if your printer accepts 1525 commands or you don't want a hard copy of the directories. Hit the return key to get to the main menu. There are several options in the main menu but since all we want to do is to check the directories we will start with F7 (utility page) Hit F7 and we will be in the Uttinty submenu, agarn there are several optiona but F1 (view a directory) 13 what we want Hit F1 and the directory of the library disk will be loaded and will scroll up on your monitor so you can see the titles of the disks (not the programa) that are in the library. The space ber will allow you to stop and start the scrolling so you can read it. Find the title of the DISK that seems of interest to you and write dawn the first 3 numbers in the titles name (example 721) viewing di rectory and noting the 5 digit numbers of the programs you want, hit return to go back to the utility submenu.

First you should realize that the MCCC library disks do not have the actual programs on them so you can't try them, the library disk only has the directories of the disks in the library. You can only see the names of the programs in the library so that you can pick the disks that has the program or programs you want to try

Hit F7 to return to the main menu. Now hit F1 (read catalag disk), the screen will change and request the MOOC catalog number (3 digits) of the disk you want to view *** xD*+ Enter the numbers and hit return. The program will get and load the directory on the screen and when the screen is full it will stop the scrolling automatically. Each time you hit any key the screen Vill scroll up 10 lines until there are less then 10 Tines left in the directory, then it will scroll up one line after you hit any key - p.6

![Image](1988_06_artifacts/image_000007_65e06f5fda37684c2dde0fe23ce2b141fe442648c147ba3d38a181939a407f38.png)

## LIBRARY DISK CATALOGER cont.

If you requested disk * 721 you see the disk name "C12B PD Games,BG" and the programs on that disk. If there are any programs that you would like on this disk just record the number so you wont forget it. When you get to the end of the directory for disk*721 it will have 2 options. F1 for anather disk or F7 for a hard copy If you have ather disks to check hit F1 and input the 3 digit number as you did before to view as many disks as you want. To return to the main menu hit the return key several times and it will return you to the main menu If you want a hard copy hit F7 after viewing the directory. Remember you do need a printer to get a hard copy. Anyway, as you can see it is easy and it will save you some time if you have the numbers of the disks you would like before going to a chapter meeting. Do try the other features of the cataloger program because you can use this program for severel things including cataloging your own personal library Rager Haggard of Sof-Tex wrote and donated the program to the MCCC and I would like to Thank Rager for the time and effort he put into the cataloger program

## AMIGA VIRUS UPDATE

(This is the latest information down loaded from People Link an new viruses and new detection programs that will identify and destroy AMIGA viruses---Joseph Pate, LONGVIEW COMPUTER USERS GROUP, Longview, TX)

## VIRUS 1.21 Steve Tibbett

You can put Virusk in your Startup-Sequence. When run, it will apen a small window so you know it's there (and it will display the occesional message in it) Whenever a disk is Inserted into any of the 3.5" drives, that disk is automagically (SiC: Isn't it funny how some typos sound BETTER?) checked for the SCA virus, and also checked to see if it's boot sector ts "Standard"

If Virusk finds a boat black it 1s suspicious about, it will present the user with a requester either warning him that the disk has the SCA virus, or telltng that the boot code ta nonstandard either case, you are given the option to either ignare it, or to remove it. VIRUS 1.2 NOTES

V1.21 is just 1.2 cleaned up a little bit. Y1.2 is the same as 1.01, but aiso adds detection of the BYTE BANDIT VIRUS both in RAM and on disk. The old -Caption on the command line is gone will automatically check ALL drives for viruses as soon as the program 15 run. When Virusk finds and removes the BYTE BANDIT VIRUS in RAM on a German A200O, the machine will sometimes crash. I don't know why this happens, but it works perfectly on the B2000 and the 500 and 1000

## BITE BANDIT VIRUS

The BYTE BANDIT VIRUS is the main reason for this release of Virust. What the BYTE BANDIT VIRUS does is, once it's in memory, it copies itself to just above the high memory painter an the first hunk of RAM it can find (Which meana it's nat always in the same place), then wedges itself into the Interrupt Server chain, into the Trackdisk device's vectors, and creates itself a Resident structure so it can hang around after re-boat

It watches EVERY disk inserted, and will write itself to ANY bootable disk that is inserted! This one can spread itke wildfire - every disk you insert into your external drive during a session with this virus loaded will resuit in all those disks being infected. OUCH!!

Also, if you install a disk while this virus 13 going, it will just copy itself back to the disk which ts why i had to wipe it from memmory in Virusk 1.2

Note that Virus will check RAM for this virus as well as the disk This was necessary es you can tell from the description above. Steve Tibbett

A SPECIAL NOTE TO ALL YOU SOF-TEX CUSTOMERS WHO CALLED FOR QUALITY WERVICE LAST MONTH, WE DO OUR BEST TO COVER ALL AREAS, BUT WE WILL JUST HAVE TO LIMIT OURSELVES TO QUALITY SERVICE THANKS!

## VIEWBOOT V1.01 (c) 1988 LATE NIGHT HACKS 2 MAR 1988

This program provides a convenient way of examining the boot block of a disk to determine the presence of a virus The program presently check for the existence of the AEK, SCA, LSD, and BYTE BANDIT viruses. If the virus check itself 1s defeated, the program still allows you to view

VIEWBOOT may be called from either the CLI or the Workbench environment. When the program 13 first called, it will examine the disk in DFO and then present the contents of the boot block to the screen. You may then choose other drives present on the system to examine by way of an in intuition type menu the boot block of a disk in an ASCH format to check for character strings that may alert you to the presence of a virus

After VIEWBOOT hes scanned a disk and found a virus, it will display a requester alerting you of it's find and stete which virus it is When a virus is found, VIEWBOOT allows you the option to erase if then or you can continue checking disks and delete it later

VIEWBOOT also allow you to check your memory for the presence of a virus, and if not able to find any of the viruses mentioned above, it allows you to have a peek at the memory where the above viruses are found (Ox 7ecO0 -0x71000) just to be sure. As it does after reading a disk, VIEWBOOT Will display the memary in ASCH format so you can check for character strings that may alert you to the fact that a virus has made itself a nice warm home in your computer memory: IMPORTANT NOTE

When viewing your disks, here are some character strings to keep an eye out for. "Virus by Byte Bandit" (Byte Bandit Virus) - Sector O "Something wonderful has happened" (SCA Virus) - Sector 1 "Another future of programming" and "Spread by Micro-Master" (AEK Virus) - Sector 1

I've not seen the LSD Virus yet, but a couple of people have told me that the program pieks it right up anyway Brian Meadovs. (MCCC Editer's Note. both VIRUSX and VIEwBOOT are avatlable via the ASCI BB5 and fram our AMIGA Library)

Machine Language Routines for the Commodore 64/128 Todd D. Heimarck and Patrick Parrish

## Harold Williams, MCCC

Computel Books publishes many of the best reference manuals and programmers guides for Commodore computers. Machine Language Routines for the Commodore 64/128 by Todd D. Hermarck and

Patrick Parrish is one of their newer publications. This book contains over 200 machine language routines that are designed to be easily inserted into your own machine language or BASIC programs

Machine Language Routines for the Commodore 64/128 1s designed to be useful to both beginning and advanced machine language programmers. The routines range from simple to use kernal routines to manipulation of hi-res screens Routines toclude character input/output, working with disk files, sprite manipulation, sound and mustc, arithmetic, sorting lists. searching Tists, PETSCI, screen codes), custom characters, IRQ coder ter character conversion (ASCIl, routines, hi-res graphics, and generation of random numbers. The routines fill over 480 pages Routines are presented with a full plata English explanation, folloved fully commented assembler code. Each routine is presented within example code so the routine can be executed Although this book is not meant to be a tutorial on beginning ML, the routines presented provide hundreds of examples of ML coding techniques and when particularly tricky coding is encountered the authors are careful to provide detailed documentation. Mast of the routines work on both the 64 and 128. Detailed comments on how to modify them for the 128 are provided when necessary. There are a few routines that are provided in seperate 64 and 128 format, and a few routines that are 128 specific

The boak also includes a reference guide to 6502 opcodes (the ML instruction set), and a section on ROM Kernal routines. The ME routines are indexed by topic and label. There is a companion disk that can be ordered from Computel Publications. The disk contains source code for all the routines from the book.

Machine Language Routines for the Commodore 64/128 should be a welcome addition to any machine language programmers library

Our first meeting in our new meeting place went off without a hitch. I don't know how mony hed trouble finding the place or finding the meeting room, but Just under thirty people were there in time to enjoy Barbara Cramer's music theory class.

showed us another of her talents with a class on how to make music on the Amige sound the way we want it to sound After a short course on musical terms and definitions, Barbera gave a top notch demonstration on how to change the format of a song to make it more interesting She even made Barry Manilow almost bearable. By making

audience participation a major part of her presentation, we were treated to a lesson that will last long pest the May meeting Thanks for an innovative and interesting class Barbera.

Coming up in June we will get to hear e presentation on programming in Modula-2 from the man who wrote Benchmark Modula-2 Leon Frenkel, formerly of Avant-Gerde Software, will talk on what has become the second most populer language for the Amiga after C. July's meeting will give us that long waited program on desktop pubitshing

Barbara took US through the steps in-volved in taking a music score from simple notes to something that you can stand to listen to. She pointed out that most scores available on BBS's and on disk are just the notes of the song. Instruments play a large part in music quality on the Amiga and instrument selection is a major concern when you are composing on this machine. Her presentation was a mini-greduate course with hand-outs VERY good! (If you see a score on a BBS with her name attached to it, GET IT! She spends hours getting things just right and it shows.

Till the next meeting, keep clicking on those keyboards and remember. the key to the Amiga is IMAGINATION. Imagine that.
