## BUILD YOUR OWN HARD DRIVE FOR THE AMIGA

Mark Hand, MCCC

Are you tired of seeing IBM hard drive prices around $350 and knowing that the same drives for the Amiga cost $700 to $1000? In defense of third party manufacturers, the requirement for an external cabinet and power supply dictates that drives designed for the 500 and 1000 cost more; however, it is possible to tap into the large supply of drives and controllers available for the IBM and significantly reduce the overall cost of a hard drive system. | recently built a 32.5 meg drive for my Amiga 1000 at a total cost of about $600. Now, at first $600 for a 32.5 meg hard drive that you build yourself may seem a little high. However, consider that the controller that I used can handle two hard drives, and you can see that another drive can be added for the cost of the second drive alone. I can add an identical drive and have 65 megabytes for less than $850! MAX is a project marketed by Palomax, Inc., that provides plans and software to the Amiga owner. It is not a kit Included in the project is complete test software, an incremental backup program, drivers and mountlists, construction diagrams and schematics, a parts list, and a list of compatible drives. Parts must be ordered from various electronics suppliers. Although Palomax recommends some circuit construction experience to complete the project, I believe that anyone with mild proficiency in soldering should have few problems.

Construction typically takes about 12-15 hours, depending on individual skill. Techniques required are soldering and wire wrapping. The bulk of the project consists of bullding the required Amiga bus interface, which allows the controller card to be plugged into the end of the computer just like any other Amiga expansion product. Palomax recommends the use of the OMTI 5527 controller with MAX, and has optimized its software to use this card. The 5527 is an RLL controller, which allows it to pack more information on a given drive, and access that information faster than a standard MFM drive. Any number of RLL rated hard drives designed for the IBM may be used. I chose the Miniscribe 8438 because it provides plenty of storage (32.5 meg) at a low price ($240, shipped). Cont. p. 6

## Hewlett Packard DeskJet Printer Dan Bonachea Reprinted from TUNA

Hewlett Packard is a name very well known in electronic instrumentation and test equipment, but not as recognizable in the personal computer market. They have made numerous attempts to enter this market with their own PC line, but, to De frank, they haven't been exceedingly successful. Their current Vectra is arguably one of their more successful products, but still is not an overwhelming hit. Portunately for us, HP has an extremely successful peripheral line, their flagship being their Laseriet II printer. Unfortunately, for the common consumer, the LaserJet II is not what most of us consider affordable. At a mail-order price of right around $1,595, the Laserjet is still out of the reach of the general computing public. Again, fortunately, MP has come to the rescue of the small business/home computerist with the introduction of the HP DeskJet.

The Desket, simply stated, is a drop-on-demand thermal inkjet printer; it forms its characters and graphic output by squirting tiny drops of ink onto paper. In times past, and even to tris day, inkjet printers have been most successful with a special clay-coated paper, which is far from cheap. Not any more. The DeskJet uses a version of canon's bubble-jet technology (which, I'm sorry to say, I know very little about), and is able to print on just about any type of paper. The Deskjet has a resolution of 75 * 75 dots per inch (dpi) in low-density, and 300 x 300 dpi in high-density. Yes,

that is correct--300 × 300 dpi! This is equivalent to just about every laser printer on the market today, and is the Deskuet's claim to fane: laser quality output at 1/3 the price!

The output of the Deskret must be seen to be believed. one can write and talk about it, but until seen, most reactions resemble "Sure.. near laser quality..." or "If you say so... "1 with the printouts that I have been making, I find it indistinguishable

Ixom laser output.

The unit itself is not a streamlined design... it reminds me of a small diesel engine with its boxy shape, but one mustn't judge a book by its cover. It contains a paper input and output tray, and automatically feeds from . the small input tray located on the bottom front of the machine. A stack of approximately 100 sheets of paper can be put in the tray, so you won't be changing paper overly often. The output tray is unique. output is carried along two side-rails until the printout is finished, then the side-rails rotate up out of the way, allowing the page to drop into the output tray. obviously, this is so that the ink on the sheet underneath the current sheet can dry before the next sheet falls; if it weren't designed that way, you might have numerous sheets with smeared print on the bottom. There is also a manual envelope feeder located in the output tray which supersedes the taking of a sheet of paper from the input tray.

The Deskjet has two speeds, 240 characters per inch (opi) in draft mode, and 120 cpi in letter-quality mode. Graphics resolutions supported are full-page 75, 100, 150, and 300 dpi. The standard print characteristics are 5, 10, 16.67, or 20 pitch, depending on printer mode and font selection, 6 ór 12 point size, depending on font selection and courier typeface. Cont. P. 4

## DESKJET Cant.

LaserJet II speaks. There are numerous font cartridges available, along with a 256K RAM expansion for downloading of HP softfonts (the Deskjet currently has a 16K buffer built in). You can also purchase an Epson FX-80 printer emulation cartridge so that you can use the Deskjet on computers which don't have any direct support for the Deskret. Iwo interfaces are included, both centronics parallel, and RS-232C serial. The Deskjet's physical size is 17.3'W X 8"H X 14.8'D (there are also metric measurements quoted in the manual, but hey. I've got the English measurement much too ingrained in me to abandon it!) HP quotes a reliability for the Deskiet of a 60,000 page lifetine, a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBP) of 20,000 hours power-on, and 12,000 printed pages per year (50 pages per day average use.)

Things I dislike - believe it or not, there are a few. There is no built-in capability to do italics; this must be purchased separately through the use of font cartridges or softfonts. Also, I can find no mention in the manual of how many pages one can expect from a single ink cartridge. In the business I Iun, this is essential, as I charge a price "per page" of printed output. I have tested the Deskret using prowrite 2.01, and I must say that output (at high density) is painfully slow, on a par with the original release of Prowrite. I don't believe this to be a fault of Prowrite, as my Apple Imagerriter II was a lot faster, and it had 4 colors to print.

Things I like -Price. For a mail-order price of $675, you can have laser-quality output, something which many small businesses could not afford before. The output is clean and crisp, depending on the type of paper chosen. Poor quality paper retums poor quality printouts, while the investment in highquality paper returns a decidedly better product. Graphic output is incomparable to anything in its price-class. Normal text-speed is very good, and even letter-quality is fast. And I finally have a printer which produces very Icadable output from pagesetter!

All in all, I think HP has a very real winner here. prom start to finish, the Deskjet is perhaps the best printer investment anyone could make. an a little reticent to let my customers know about it through... at this price, trey can do their oun laser-quality output!

## BABBAGES

NORTH EAST MALL - HURST 589-0603 LOOK FOR OUR SEYEN OTHER STORES THROUGHOUT THE METROPLEX!!!

The latest episode of the Carmen sandiego prograns is now on the shelf for the 6=64. WHERE IN THE USA IS CARMEN SANDIEGO hit the shelf about a month ago. Included in the program is the latest copy of pedoí's Guide to the united states to help you track down carmen and her gang of thieves.

The game is played exactly like the original version there are no suprises, just good old fashioned deduction and game play

another easy to play game this month is 4X4 OFP-ROAD RACING by Epyx. In this game you are given the choice of four 4x4 truck racing challenges: The Georgia Mud Pest, The Michigan the winter wreck-off, Death Valley Trek or the Baja challenge. After you decide which course you want to tackle you choose one of four trucks, customize it and stock it with tools and supplies you. might need, including food and water, depending on the terrain of the course you selected. Then it's off to the races.

You can slip and slide on the ice in Michigan, get bogged down in mud in Georgia, or swelter in the heat of the deserts of Baja or Death Valley. Be sure to look out for those skeletons, rocks, tires and other obstacles in the road fox they can and will cause accidents, sometimes deadly. I even killed my sweet little doggie one time, and he had just gone along for the ride.

Both of these games are good for the kids home for the summer as they are entertaining without putting a strain on the Drain. (I think the kids brains sometimes go into hibernation during the sumner, and these games will help wake up some of those brains cells without the pain associated with school. y

Just a note on thinking games---If your kids watch many of the game shows on television, like Jeopardy ox $10,000 Pyramid, the computer versions are very good and the cost is under $15. We have several that my oldest daughter plays frequently and really enjoys.

CAD-PAK 54, an advanced full featured design and drawing program, is not for the novice artist. However any budding design artist will enjoy using this program even though the program is slow moving. I did not have a light pen ( which probably is faster) so I had to use the keyboard entry mode. The 93 page instructional manual is well written and is a MUST if you want to get anything out of this program. The main advantage to CAD-PAK 64 is the ability to scale.

At the beginning of the program you are asked several questions to determine the size of your final print out.

CAD-PAK 64 has been around for quite awhile, and is more oriented to commercial need than that of the general computer artist. I have seen this program around and know of people that own it.

## Demon Stalkers

## By Micro Forte, Electronic Arts Barbara Cramer, MCCC

I seldom enjoy playing a game so much that I hesitate to retur the review copy, much less, quit playing in order the to begin writing. Demon Stalkers for the Commodore 64 and 128 is excellent. 100 levels of mazes, adversaries, physical and logical puzzles to solve and action arcade adventure. If this isn't enough, enjoy creating your own with the construction set.

The scenario is much the same as every other game based on the mythological, magical past. You are the good guy battling the bad guy, calvrak, who uses fiendish traps to fool you and hordes of monsters to sap your strength. At first there is a striking sinilarity to the award-winning Apshai trilogy games, mazes, treasures, rodents and health indicators. The size of each level is approximately 3 screens by 4 screens with various paths and colox combinations

## DEMON STALKERS Cont.

used on each level.

unlike the Asphai games, Demon Stalkers actually teaches you how to be successful. Scrolls are left to give you helpful information, even hints and with the flexibility of 100 levels you will not soon get frustrated by an escalating difficulty ratio. It all else fails, you can always go to the construction set and Test-play a level that gives you trouble in order to master it and then return to your saved game. Another - nice feature is that many levels are interactive requiring that you travel in a three dimensional nature making the game more realistic.

Your very first task is to make a copy of the scenario disk with the copy progran provided. You may make as many copies as you like but only one game in progress will be saved to the disk. The program disk is heavily protected which often becomes a nuisance. I learned the hard way to disconnect Pastload and to keep the code chart close at hand for the periodic keyword checks. In addition, the gameplay allows you to earn additional health points by taking a reading comprehension quiz reminiscent of the high school s.A.I. exan. You remember those tests where you are given a paragraph to read and then asked a question to see what you have retained. My mental health can do without those little reminders of the Graduate Record Exam.

one of the nicest features of Demon stalkers, however, is found in the gameplay. While there is a 'perfect' way to solve each level and proceed to the next, there are options when . you are backed in a corner or when you are first learning. It took me two days to discover that I had skipped level three by using a particular strategy; I was enjoying the game so much that I hadn't paid attention to the level numbers. But that is the very point; you don't have to solve each level perfectly to proceed. Perhaps eventually you will want to do it 'right' but if you fail at first, you are not stuck in one place until you get it right.

The two player game mode is even more interesting. While you must share the food and treasures, you have the added strength of working together not against each other. one player may specialize in defense while the other grabs treasures and keys. What a novel idea! My six year old was thrilled to play with me, cooperating with me and sharing in the treasures.

There is more, much more, but I must compliment the cover artist who rendered a design which accurately depicts the feel of the game. The cover stimulates your imagination without exaggeration. The cover shows exactly how the game Vfeels/n. Bravo, Plectronic Arts.

If you enjoy playing games on your c84 °= C128, don't miss Demon Stalkers. It is a fine product at a reasonable price.

## AMIGA HARD DISK DRIVE cont

These speeds are respectable, especially considering that amigados 1.3 should provide an increase of 4 to 5 times.

Palomax reports no compatibility problems with other peripherals. I am curiently using it along with a printer, external 3.5 floppy, 2ma expansion memory card, and a modem. It can be built to pass the bus, and with a small modification can be used on both the amiga 500 and 1000. I had only a couple of problems during construction, and a call to palomax quickly fixed them both.

These prices represent a bit of shopping around to find the best prices on parts. A good place to look for drives and controllers is in the computer Shoppers Guide. Also note that if the interface does not pass the bus, the overall price drops by about $20 (The cost of the extender board material). In conclusion, the MAX project represents the opportunity to tuxbocharge your Amiga for much less than currently available alternatives. A project like this is not for everyone; however, for many the task will provide an enjoyable and affordable way to make that upgrade they have been planning.

## NEW FOR THE AMIGA: DR. TERM PROFESSIONAL Bill Raecke, MCCC

Dr. Term Professional is the latest terminal program for the Aniga. Always on the lookout for the perfect terminal program, I recently purchased It and decided I would pass along my observations to others who may be interested.

Pirst, my idea of what an ideal terminal progran for the amiga woula include. supported protocols should include ASCII, xModem, w-xModem, y-Modem, Kermit, and z-Modem. Automatic file chopping should be provided for all but ARc'ed 200'ed or PAK'ed files. It should allow multi-tasking. It should provide a script language with the provision of executing a script automatically upon connection to a host. It should allow you to execute the program on a custom screen. It should provide you with a full 80 column display. It should be bug-free.

All the terminal prograns until now have failed on one or more of these points. In the commercial world, online! and Diga are the two major competitors. Neither offers w-xMadem, a requirement for those of us who regularly use Peopleiink. In the public- domain/ shareware arena, AMIC-Term and ACCESS! are the major players. AMIC-Tern offers a minimal script language but it will not automatically execute a script upon connection. It also does not support 2-Moden. It's major flaw, however, is it's habit of crashing your system at the end of an ASCII upload. ACCESS! offers no script language at all and supports only the xmodem and w-xModen protocols.

And so the search for the perfect terminal program continues. When I got my copy of DI. Term Professional home and began messing with it, I was innediately impressed. It does not allow for execution on a custom screen - a minor annoyance. The user interface is also a little unusual for an aniga, using the ' for a command prefix rather than the normal aniga key combinations normally used for menu alternatives lit is quite obviously a port from another computer). After using the program for a while, I became quite comfortable with it. All the major protocols are cont. p. 10

provided with the exception of 2-Modem. Even w-xModem is supported. It provides a very complete script language and allows the user to execute a series of commands automatically after connection to a host. My only complaint here is that the documentation seems skimpy in this area. It took me quite some time to get my lag-on procedure to work properly due to a lack of understanding of what the proper command setup should be.

For a while I thought I had finally found it-perfection. But then reality came to visit and I began to notice flaws and omissions. The only real bug I have encountered has to do with downloading programs. At the end of a file transmission the program will often begin to report "TIMEOUT" waiting fox the next block to be transmitted. The program simply never notices the end-of-transmission . signal from the host and continues to wait for more data. This is something I have never encountered with any other program but which seems to happen about half the time with this one. A rather serious flaw. Luckily the authors have provided a way around it. By selecting "End Receive" from the menu or typing 'ER on the keyboard, the buffer is flushed, the file is closed and you are back in control again.

one major omission - almost as serious as the end-of- transmission bug. Automatic file chopping is not provided. As most of you know, AMI is very particular about file lengths and does not tolerate the padding added by xMadem, W-xModem, or 8- Moden. ARc'ing a file gets around this problem because the ARC command is not particular about lengths and the un-ARC'ed files will work just fine. when downloading an un-ARc'ed file however, the padding added to achieve equal size blocks must be removed at the receiving end. Most Amiga terminal programs do that automatically. DI. Term does not, requiring you to use a utility program to accomplish the task.

one more complaint. When DI. Term is booted, it accesses the printer device, activates it, and locks it. This is fine in otrer computers, but in the multi-tasking amiga, it is a flaw. It means that you cannot print anything using any other program while DI. Ierm is running.

summary? De. Term Professional comes very close to providing the ultimate terminal program. with the addition of 2-Moden and the correction of the problems mentioned above, it could be unbeatable. In the meantime however, ACCESS! is probably still your best bet. It is bug-free and its only omissions are its lack of protocol support and a script language. Best of all, it is shareware with only a $25 donation requested. If upgrades are made to DI. Team Professional, I will report trem here.

A programmer's delight is what was served last month as we heard all about the benefits of programming in Modula-2 from the man who wrote the book and the language). Leon Prenkel, author of Benchmark Modula-2, gave an excellant presentation of language that is as powerful as 'c' but easier to understand, being not quite so cryptic. with at least three compilers for Modula-2 on the market for the Aniga, it has definitely staked out a claim for itself on this machine. | one of its particularly nice features is an

The June meeting featured a presentation on home banking by Myra Kirkland of First Republic Bank. This is a wonderful system for anyone with an Aniga and a modem. It gives you a reason for having this machine (besides playing games, viewing pictures, etc). That is, tris facility can save you time and money (translation: here is a practical use, a viable justification for the one thousand plus dollars investment).

The basic reason for using home banking is that it allows you to pay your creditors on time without the following:

- (1) write the check;
- (2) record the check;
- (3) address the envelope;
- (4) seal the envelope;
- (5) re-open the envelope, insert the check and re-seal

## MINUTES FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

John Malmstrom

There isn't too much to report from the June Board of Directors meeting even though it was a long one. We spent most of our time discussing a little dilemma regarding the upcoming METCOM 88, for which we had reserved space at the Arlington Convention Center (ACC) on october 8. Seems as though that date was in conflict with one of the "major"

commodore shows and several of the vendors we were expecting couldn't make it to oux wingding on the 8th. No other date was available at ACC, but Jack Detoxe had contacted the people at Infomart in Dallas and found that we could obtain space for our meeting on octobex 15. After much discussion on the pros and cons, the board decided to leave the date where it was and take our chances. well as it turned out, there was a cancellation at ACC and Jack was able to make a reservation for october 29, 1988 -more desirable date for our conference anyway. So, mark that date -october 29, 1988 - on your calendar and plan to attend METCOM 88. Jack and his committee are hard at work putting together a really dynamite day.

Hexe's the membership breakdown as of 6-18-88:
