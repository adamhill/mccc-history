## excellence! A Review by Walker Jackson Mid-Cities Commodore Club

I have been using "excellence" for the past couple of months. It is a fully functioning word processor nicely keyed into the Amiga operating system. I was initially rather irritated when I first opened the package, a small flyer fell out and it was a notice that for an additional $151 could get a 1 MEG version! From this I felt that I all of excellence's functions kept resident in memory and no disk accesses are required during program execution On a floppy system this is not really a handicap but does on occasion require some disk swapping while on a hard drive system it would probably not even be noticed. The list price is a rather heady $299, fortunately it is available from several sources for around 1/2 list. The 2 disks that come with the system are not copy protected and easily installed on a hard disk, and backed up.

It will multitask, but it is a real memory bog. I have run it and a telecommunications program, while excellence! was printing a document I was on StarText at l2l0 baud with no problem. While the program will multitask with another program, it does not multitask within itself. When you print your output in the graphics (Normal) mode it can take quite a while and the program is tied up with your 72-bubble pointer. No other functions or features can be used until the print is completed You can click to some other program to work on while the printing is in progress, but word processing in excellencel is on hold until the print out is completed, this can be frustrating. It would be nice to edit another document while one was printing out in the background.

## FONTS, GRAPHICS, PRINTER SUPPORT:

Multiple docurents can be open at a time, limited only by memory, but only one window is supported for each document Standard AsCI text can be imported as well as Scribblel files, a predecessor to excellence. Up to 120 Amiga fonts can be supported in a single document. Each font chosen must be (or is) kept in memory at all times, thus the more fonts chosen the more memory eaten-up. The basic Amiga fonts come with the system, but I now have 34 fonts, these are chosen from a pull down menu Postscript is supported and several postscript fonts are included.

This is not a page generation program; it is a powerful word processor which supports rudimentary graphics. Any lif graphics file can be imported into an excellence! document. It is then cropped and resized as required to fit. Each graphic occupies one line of text. Text cannot flow around the graphic, though that effect can be simulated by using a multicolumn format for the document.

Any preference printer is supported The new 13 printer device and arvers are included in the package Printer control is done via pull down menu and not by embedded printer codes. In fact i have not been able to find a way to embed printer codes. Printing is done via a requestor and allows for Normal (graphics), or NIg and Draft using fonts resident in the printer. Single or multiple copies can be printed as well as a single or group of pages from within a document. This is a true WYSIWYG word processor: A careat excellence! is a graphically based WP and as such can at times get bogged down in the graphics, each letter is painted on the screen. But, there seems to be a more than adequate type ahead buffer. It is a bit disconcerting to be several words abead of the output to the screen, but excellence! does catch up. This problem is only noted while inserting text in the middle of a line of text

Operation of the system is very intuitive and a manual is barely needed to get started or to do basic text entry and modification. All functions are chosen via pull down menus or as a keyboard equivalence. The first chapter of the manual is a tutorial directed at the novice computer. user, though not the rank amateur. Several example text files are on the system disk to practice with The rest of the manual is a description of the various WP functions. The index has much to be desired, but once you find the section you are looking for the explanations are very straight forward As a whole the manual is better than most, but (software

houses are you listening) the index is one of the most important parts of the documentation Especially when it is over 300 pages long and has 8 appendixes.

## FEATURES:

excellence! has more features than most people will need, and can keep even power users happy. Text can be formatted in a variety of ways, 1 to 4 columns. However, the number of columns may not change in a single document Pages may have headers and footers, and these can be different for even and odd numbered pages. footnotes are supported and are very easy to use. They do have the problem that when a section of text is copied, the footnotes do not come with it and have to be reinserted into the new document, this is a simple cut and paste procedure, but I would expect footnotes to follow their text

A table of contents and an index can be generated for the document. The appropriate locations / words are marked in the document and the table of contents and index are generated at the time of printing. This is a feature only for those writing long papers or books. It would not be used often by the casual user but none of the "power" features get in the way of the novice

User defined glossaries are provided. These can be as simple as a group of frequently used words or phrases or remap function keys and automatic document formatting, mail merging and printing.

Math functions are provided with the result placed in the clipboord and easily copied into the document. Yes the clipboard is supported, making easy integration with other programs.

## DOCUMENT CHECKING:

A nice spelling checker is included in the package It has a rather generous 90,000 word primary dictionary and a user defined dictionary(s) The user dictionary is built in real time. That is, as a document's spelling is being checked and an unknown word is encountered a choice is provided; you may iguore, or learn lie add to the user dictionary) the new word. Multiple user dictionaries are supported though only one may be in use at a time. A really nice touch is that the speller can check the document in real time, that is as you type it in, alerting you to any misspelled words when you enter them. The dictionary may be left on disk (slowl) or loaded into RAM (great, but eats memory). The misspelled word selection algorithm does need some work, surely my speling is nt tht bo

A Thesaurus is included which can supply synonyms, antonyms, or both. And, entries supplied by the thesaurus can have synonyms etc. called from them also, but this is usually not useful as you generally get circular definitions.

A grammar evaluator is also present. It checks for backneyed phrases, common punctuation errors, archaic language, unbalanced punctuation, capitalization, doubled words, and more. These errors are presented during the evaluation and may be corrected as they are discovered. A rather bumbling summary of your document is then listed detailing such things as number of sentences, their average length, word count and average word length. Then it gets nasty. You are graded on readability, number of words per sentence, average length of words, use of passive voice and prepositions as percentage of words. It gets worse. Your document is then compared to a variety of documents based on the above grading. Fortunately all this can be toggled on or off and the error messages are written to a file so all this can be done unattended and errors corrected later.

Hyphenation is supported. Soft hyphens are inserted in large words which allows them to split only if required to be divided over two lines. This process can be done automatically or guided by the user; however, the algorithm does occasionally insert an byphen in an awkward location. This feature is really only needed when more than one column is used and a multisyllable word would make the column margins very ragged.

## SUMMARY:

This is one of the most powerful word processors on the market today. It is obviously gunning for the WordPerfect market and in my eyes has it beat The high points for me are, multiple font support, easy spell checking, multicolumns, footnotes, and graphic support Colors are supported but on this feature I can't comment This and many other features can't be reviewed in the limited space and time available. This is a very powerful program with features enough to keep the "Power User" happy without complicating casual use.

## The Panasonic KK-P1524 Printer

Amiga

## A Review by Walker Jackson Mid-Cities Commodore Club

The Panasonic KX-P1524 24 pin wide printer · generally lists for slightly less than $1000 but can be purchased through the mail and from local discount houses for just a few dollars more than $500. reviewed in Byte, PC and Amiga World.

I have found the printer to be rugged. easy to use, and have excellent print quality. In the timing comparisons done in the reviews in the above magazines the only real criticis has been that it has been a bit slower than it competitors. This difference is small and at a much reduced price it is by far a better deal for me.. A note any printer, even hammer and chisel, can keep up with the Amiga's graphics output :-)! Print quality in the reviews was always excellent, even when compared with high end (read that high priced) printers.

It emulates several printers but on top of most peoples' list are the IBM ProPrinter and Epson LQ-1500. The Epson is supported from preferences and under 1.3 the 24 pin modes are supported. Іл fact the printer does not seem to really have a native mode.

Print output is excellent. Using the resident font and Letter Quality mode the letters appear solid. A Draft (fast) mode and Text (medium speed) mode are also available. Graphics output is very good with 360 DPI horizontal and 180 DPI vertical, and with n/180 inch line feeds; 360 DPI vertical. I have not heard of any graphics package that support this, though the potential is exciting.

Almost everything can be controlled from the front panel. Print pitch can be controlled with 10, 12, 15, 17, and 20 CPI. The choice of Draft - Text - LQ is also chosen from the panel. Page length is also controllable from the front panel and when done resets the page TOP - VERY handy! Multiple other less used options are also available as are the routine FF (form feed) and LF (line feed). Form handling is tractor, push type and friction. Form parking is also supported, that is the tractor forms can be withdrawn from the platen and single sheet paper used, the the

In summary the KX-P1524 is an excellent printer and when purchased at a discounted price is a value difficult to beat.

tractor form is then automatically reloaded. This is also a WIDE carriage printer 50 those tiny labels to the giant green bar forms will fit. All the low level choices are selected from a set of DIP switches. Two interfaces are supplied: Centronics parallel and a serial port.

## Thoughts on Computer Users, Applications, and User Groups Commentary by Jim Kaminski Mid-Cities Commodore Club

![Image](1988_10_artifacts/image_000006_d1b4f4c1f20e7efc2c63c30e1e06040c44a868995a8e86c826d6bcd2d8f388c1.png)

A person buys a computer and becomes an OWNER for only a short time. During this period most owners fumble a bit yet somehow learn the basics; how to connect the wires, where the power switches are, how to use a floppy disk, and so on Then the computer owner becomes a USER by trying to figure out what to use this new device for, and then how to use it There are just a few overall uses for a computer, some of them are very general, some very specific or unusual One way to group them is under the following categories: text processing, number processing, data processing, entertainment, graphics processing, telecomunications, and device processing.

At the beginning of the microcomputer era, programs were not widely available nor were they very advanced. One had to either accept a mediocre product or actively instruct (program) the computer to perform as needed In either case this required a great deal of experimentation since the existing documentation sharing this information, magazines another, and electronic bulletin boards a third All three of these information sources were initially very

Some of these categories are unfamiliar to many computer users, but each application is important to at least some users. With the possible exception of entertainment, a computer user has to learn to really CONTROL the computer system for the application to be successful The following discussion provides ideas on how this learning may occur, and how it relates to user groups.

was poor. User groups became one means of important in sharing computer knowledge.

Today the situation is different Computers have become so popular that a wide variety of high quality software has been developed A person who wants to write a book, or a letter, or anything in between now will select a text processing program with the preferred features and try to concentrate on the activity of more importance - writing. However, though the final, written product may be excellent, the effort to get there now requires learning the program quirks, learning how to type, and putting up with the frustrations inherent in computing (warmup and loading times, disk access, printing time, paper alignment subtieties, and so on). And when there is a special need and the answers are not evident, such as the printing of a square root sign, well-

Number and data processing is really the thrust of truly powerful computer applications, where large quantities of numbers (or data) can be manipulated quickly, and somewhat accurately. Furthermore, numbers (and data) are more compact symbols than words, with more diverse relationships. Thus spreadsheets, tax plans, checkbook keepers, stock market analysers, and even theoretical mathematics all are possible with the proper software fall currently available, 100) However, these applications have drawbacks for the new computer user. On one hand, data entry is a time consuming action On the other, once the program is understood and data has been entered, the actual calculation time is NEVER fast enough, regardless of the computer or program In the more popular applications (checkbook balancing, tax computation, and hobby inventories), the individual must obtain the numbers or

## What's New At Babbages Software Review By Cheryl Howard Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Now that school is in full swing and the money flying out of our pockets those school supplies, I thought I would look at some expensive software packages on the Mastertronic another of their low-priced ? on 1 packages for the C-64 called PECOS PETE AND PIPELINE 2, You'll notice right off that Mastertronic is really pushing the PIPELINE series, the game structure is the same versions, I will concentrate on PETE. reminders of early 6g games are games but the better graphic capabilities

we now have. The main controls for this game consist of a joystick in port 2, the Run/Stop key which pauses the game and the F7 key to toggle the music. You start the game out on the desert, walking of all things. 5orry folk, no horse. All you have to do is walk across the desert protecting yourself your trusty whip from various desert plants and critters plus flying arrows from unseen Indians. Any plant you brush up against drains some of your energy, and you don't have the control to except from left to right, 50 break out the whip and fire away at anything and everything EXCEPT the rum jug. Brushing up against that gives you елегсу. After the desert, there are gunfights with a town full of outlaws and even a

But it ain't easy, pardner, You've got to catch and drink the glasses of beer whizzing towards you. If you liss four in a row the town bully gets real MEAN. Last but not least, you get to milk a cow.

low-priced game ‹under $10) is Mastertronic's WATER POLO. This game is a combination of soccer and basketball in a 5willllling pool. The game is played by two teams of thirteen, goalies and eleven field players. You only have seven players in the water at any time and the swimming pool is 18 meters deep, 20 meters wide by 30 meters long. At least that was the size of pool at the Olympic Games. You'll have to use your imagination here and pretend.

Let's face it, this doesn't sound like a super-charged, actionpacked game. It won't hold candle to some of the higher priced games, but it is a good game the price. I mean, what do you expect for $5.95.

You have the option of a demo, one player or two player game, along with a championship The game is joystick controlled and you have to name team(s). From then on, it is non-stop action. The team on the left is controlled by joystick two and players are in red jerseys. The right team is controlled by joystick one and players wear blue.

The games are played just like the Olympic Games version in series of rounds all the way through a tournament to find out who the best team is. This is an interesting game for Olympic type competitions. If you are not sports inclined, you lose interest since the strategy behind

the game is in the way the ball is played and is not the same as in adventure game. It is well worth the money.

Sweet little Bubble Ghost is

Accolade has come out with a fun little program called BUBBLE GHOST. The premise behind this game is that an inventor named Heinrich Von 5chtinker has died, or so everybody thought. However, it seems that the night-watchman at Von Schtinker's castle believes that the castle is haunted and sure enough, von Schtinker's spirit has indeed returned to the castle as BUBBLE GHOST, blowing bubbles through-out the macabre halls. Your job is to help BUBBLE GHOST through the 35 rooms of the castle. Once this is done, the haunting will cease. Sounds easy. doesn't it?

indestructible, Unfortunately the bubble is not and it pops VERY EASILY!!! To move the bubble and Bubble Ghost you must use the joystick Which controls Bubble Ghost, who in turn controls the movement of the bubble by blowing on it. To win the game you must blow the bubble through all 35 rooms of the castle without Bubble Ghost losing all of his 6 lives. You can earn extra lives by reaching levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. You earn points for each level you complete, more points for "effective breathing techniques", and for time lift on the bonus counter.

This cute little game was very entertaining and although I didn't feel it was worth $25.45, I still enjoyed it.

## Processor Accelerator

CMI

Easy to install, good documentation, well build and fair priced!

CMl's Processor accelerator speeds your Amiga up by about 20 to 35%. So far it seems to be compatible with all Amiga Software. If you want more power in your Amiga but don't want to waste a ton of money for 68020's etc. this is definitely a good alternative!

## X-SPECS-3D

If you are "in graphics' you should have a look at -or better through- these glasses!

X-Specs-30 open up a whole new world of future Amiga products. Yes, future...

So you ask, 'what the hell can i do with 'em now?' Well, be creative! You can create your own 3D graphics for use with X-Specs- 3D using Silver, Sculpt 3D, Digi -View and a camera, etc. The main trick is to have 2 IFF-images that are made from slightly different view (or camera) positions.

## Frame Grabber

This is basically a high speed Digi-View wilh some nice extros : 1. Digilize in color from a VCR or a Camcorder 2. Find off controts on the front panel. Picture quality ? Well, like Digi-View; it's not easy to set oll those controls right.

If done correctly it should be much better than Digi View looking at the Demos supplied by Progressive Peripherals.

## Commentary

## (Continued from Page 5)

intormation, key them in as required by the program, and then wait for the results. Even if this effort is successfully completed once, repeat attempts to broaden the scope of the initial effort are often met with a less than an enthusiastic attitude. The usefulness of the computer is appreciated only when 'all' data is entered and mere updating is anticipated (and the printouts are short. Moreover, this feeling of satisfaction may dissipate when the computer system or soltware is upgraded or replaced, thus requiring a repeat of the program setup, tollowed by additional data entry or a VERY technical session tor transterring the data something unusual happens, sidesteps the issue. Thus the 'current learning process is to read the docs or

Then there are the esoteric applications: graphics processing, telecommunications, and device processing. They may be considered esoteric because tew computer users pursue these applications. With little exaggeration, virtually every program tor every computer uses a ditterent tormat tor graphic images. EDITORS NOTE: One notable exception is the Irf format on the Amiga). Conversion from one format to another is desirable but never easy (even though conversion programs exist) and overall printer compatibility does not exist (especially with their ribbons). Telecommunications has its oun world of jargon and unique problems, some of which are not unlike the story of the Tower of Babble. The newcomer often gets lost in this world fraught with very technical problems (and thus relies on cookbook solutions whenever possible). The control of devices (such as light controllers, video cameras, musical devices, and electronic sensors) is also extremely unique to each situation The result? Very few knowledgeable or expert users exist for these areas.

today agonizes over the problem and then, unless

Given this state of user education, what is the role of the user group today, especially for C-t4 and C-128 users? The true hackers nave already moved on to the MS-DOS world, or to the latest technological wonder, the amiga so the 'gutsy expertise has left the user groups. The most that the C-64/128 user group can ofter today, given the type of learning described above, is to point the new computer use in the right direction when the problems are relatively simple although on occasion there may be an answer for that unusual situation, any expectation of obtaining this level of help trom today's user group is unreasonable. True, the level of knowledge of the average commodore computer user is FAR greater than that of an IBM or Mac user, but often it is not enough to offer as detailed an answer as could be expected "in the days of yesteryear."

ignore the issue.

Advice? If you want a simple solution, get a Mac. If you want business compatibility, get an IBM clone If you want to play (games or as a hobby), get the Amiga If you want a personal challenge, on a small budget, get a C-64/128 User groups continue, but tor the most part will simply point in the general direction of an answer. And then again, this is only My opinion published computer and non-computer newsletters, and moonlighted as a computer consultant. My engineering work experience has also made me comfortable in using Macintosh and IBM-type PCs. This commentary is based on my experiences.

Who am I? Someone who still keys on his VIC-20 and 6-64, has programmed and rewired his computers, uses a lot of sottware, and generally dabbles extensively with all of the previously mentioned applications. Ive run user groups,

Similarly, few non-IBM PC users today have exactly the same computer system configuration, meaning that system knowledge has become very specialized Moreover, today's computer user often has no desire to reprogram their softvare to address the problem, nor is there always anyone in the user group or on an electronic bulletin board who has found an answer which can be used for that particular system (The exceptions generally concern only the easy problems, which are often found in the readers' mail section of magazines.) Since oftentimes no one can help, the computer user of

## Amiga-By-The-Loop

## Brent Wood

The weather did not look like it was going to cooperate for our telecommunications presentation but the power stayed on and David Owens took us step-by-step through "GT-Term". This public domain "demo version" is complete in almost every way. It's due out as a commercial offering from Progressive Peripherals &amp; Software but is still available from the club BBS or library:

October is also MET*COM month! The preperations will be finalized in the coming days. you can help with the meeting in any way let your club officials know. This is a BIG project and is shaping up to be very successful

All members should attend October's meetings and exercise your rights as a club member. Nominations for club chapter officers will be taken. If you would like to serve the club as an officer or would like to nominate someone who is interested be at the next chapter meeting. At least one position will be racated this year and will need to be filled. People run the club, it doesn't run itself.

October Il is the "Loop's" next meeting. Rick Bilyes will be there with e software presentation. A little club business at 730 and then the show. Bring a new member! Amigas are being sold left and right. There MUST be some new owners around you!

At our September meeting, club president Harold Williams demonstrated Superbase, a versatile database program. He showed how a sophisticated user can tailor an application so that a computerphobic user can process a data file without having to wade through the manual. Harold also described the new library disks for Sidplayer and CAD 30

We had a short BASIC lesson, and then James Dunnam reviewed disk #331, "Action Games.' He said some of the games were good and some weren't, but game players will want to try them.

Next month, Donald Tate will demonstrate business accounting programs, and Jim Marshall will review a library disk. The meeting will be Saturday, October B, at 130 p.m, in the Southwest Regional Library on Hulen Street.

## Amiga Central

## Bill Raecke

The Amiga Central meeting featured a presentation of the latest PD telecommunications package for the Amiga, GT Term. This is a full featured program which will : 300N be even more improved and released as a commercial package by Progressive Peripherals and Software. It should be worth watching for. Thanks to Dave Owens for a job well done in filling in for the currently out-of-pocket and out-of-country Bill Keatley. Nice job, Dave.

Richard Bileya, in his on-going role as rumor-gatherer and information-spreader, told us, again, that 13 Workbench will be out real soon now. Despite this error in judgement, he was allowed to continue with the rest of his news.

The door prize for the month was a copy of Fantavision provided as usual by Software Terminal. Congratulations go to David Owens for being the lucky winner. And once again, our thanks to Sofware Terminal for their continued support

Other good news of the evening; Jean Riley, our resident Amiga artist, received word that some of her art work may become part of a national tour featuring computer art Best of luck, Jean Its nice to see our local talent recognized.

it the September i7th meeting a discussion was held about the next too meetings. On Movember 19 me will be electing officers for the next year but me need nore volunteers. A suggestion mas made that me have a Christmas party in December for all the neabers. He could still use ideas for both aeetings.

If the Uctober Board of Directors deeting, blenn Schneider will be leading a discussion for the idea to merge several chapters together. This would make a "Super Chapter" in the Mortheast Tarrant County and Morth and Hest Fort Horth. Under his proposal the HEB Chapter would that the meetings would be moved to a nem location, turned to the better for them.

Several discussions were held at the Septenber meeting, all pertaining to sord processing. One of the five was to teach children word processing. All were demonstrated on the C64 computer.

By the way, if you have any ribbons that you need reinked contact Laura Clements at 817-589-0659.

At the meeting, Okley Moss talked about Fontmaster I and Speedscript, Glenn Schneider talked about Hord Writer, Jack Slay presented his Geos 64, and Eldor Luedtke, Mr. talked about Snoopy Writer.

Okley continued on by talking about Speedscript 3.0. He demonstrated that while typing text it will put in the returns automatically when you reach the end of the line. It has no help menus but it is an easy aord processor to use. Version 3.2 is nost recent version.

Okley started off by saying that Fontmaster Il has a demo program and several help screens. It also has a customizer which can handle 32 different fonts and has left, right, and center justification. It has different types of special characters to shoe different languages such as hebrew, greek, chinese or create your oun. You can send your document to the screen or to the printer. It does not, homever, have a spelling checker. This word processor has serge-print capabilities. You can save the documents as sequential or as program files

Glenn Schneider discussed Hordüriter 5.1 which is the must recent version. It is very easy to use, has a spelling checker, has preset tabs, and is compatible with beos 64. After typing your document and doing editing, usually you would have to adjust all the lines, but with this mord processor all you have to do is hit the C64 key and the number 4 and everything is reformatted. You can merge your work with · several different databases like the Data Manager 1 and Il or the Electronic Checkbook and/or Tiles.

Eldor Luedtke, Ur. gave a demonstration of "Snoopy Writer" which is as Eidor said, a word processor designed with kids in mind. This is a story maker with which a child can write a story with up to 400 words. It uses the Peanuts characters for designs in the background. . You can print out, save and load any of the files aade up. This program can be purchased at the Electronic Boutique located at the forth Hills Mall.

Jack Slay talked about Georite I which is another word processor. This progrom looks like a typical Macintosh screen. It has pull down menus in which you use your joystick or souse for the options ("point and click").

A fes words from the experts:

All word processors have the same basic commands.

Word processors are like an electronic typewriter except you don't have to hit the return key all the time. This is accomodated by the gorderop feature found in nost word processors.

Always save your document often in case your computer has a memory loss.

Always use a copy of the program diskette - do not use the original.

The Might Chapter's September meeting featured an interesting program presented by Danny Dunn concerning the use of Machine Language in place of BASIC to speed up tasks which BASIC tends to carry out at a very slow pace. Danny desonstrated three examples. The first mos a program to display all of the color combinations for printing, screen and border available on the b4. By smitching from BASIC to ML he reduced execution time from over one and one-half hours to less than tao ainutes. In another example in which he mas controlling sprites Danny demonstrated that a delay loop was necessory in hu to slow down program execution so that the screen display could Keep up with the computer and give smooth scrolling and that for this application the loop needed to be executed about 5 million times to run at the same speed as BASIC. Mext month the meeting will be on October ll at the church.
