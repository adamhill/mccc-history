## HELP NEEDED !!!

Tony Velez, MCCC Librarian

The MCCC Library of public domain programs has really grown since the club started its library, from a modest few disks to over 325 disks full of programs for the Commodore 64, 128 and CP/M. In fact, we probably have close to 3,000 programs in our library for our club members to enjoy and to get the most out of their Commodore computers... We have just about every type of public domain program available however quite a few are older programs. Updated versions and newer programs are very slow in coming to us since our normal sources of programs (other Commodore clubs) have the same programs as we have We must therefore find other sources of public domain software for our library

Bruce Umbreit, our corresponding librarian, has written to other Commodore computer clubs that we haye not been in contact with before but the prospects of getting some new programs for our club library seem very slim since he has not received very many replies to his letters

A lot of the software on these national bulletin board systems are shareware programs, so the authors would like the programs that they have worked so hard on, to be shared with as many Commodore users as possible. This is how the authors get their donations so that they can keep writing software. The more people that use their programs the greater the chance of getting donations for them. This sharing of programs will benefit both the authors and your fellow club members. So if there is anyway you can help get some programs for the club please do. Your fellow members would appreciate it and so will l...

That's why I am asking any MCCC members that are on some of the national bulletin board systems that have a download section of commodore software, to help us out. i you download any public domain software for yourself, please consider donating the programs to the club to be put into the library. Help us make our library the best in the country... am not asking you to spend your money or use up your on-line time just to domnload some programs to the club, what l am asking is if you download any software that you want for yourself, please share them with the other club members that may not be on one of the big bulletin board systems.

Thanks for any help or suggestions you can give us to improve the library

## WHAT'S NEW IN SOFTWARE Cheryl Hovard, MCCC

Last month | mentioned several new programs on the shelf at Babbage's in Northeast Mall. One of these programs was MICROLEAGUE WRESTLING. It is still on the shelf this month and is definitely a game for wrestling fans, especially if you are a Hulk Hogan fan and watch the WWF matches on cable television.

MICROLEAGUE WRESTLING combines the familiar concept of play options including joystick or keyboard control and playing against the computer. There may be one or two players and players may choose their preferences of control. One player may use joystick, while the other player may choose to use the other joystick or even keyboard control or vice versa. Whichever choice is made by player *1 the other player must choose an alternate play option. Then the time limit for each match is selected with the choice of a 10 minute, 20 minute or special 60 minute Grudge Match MICROLEAGUE WRESTLING is truly a real time simulation (/ actually timed the matches against the wall clock), with Digitized Visual Action. If your monitor display is crisp and clear, this is an interesting change from the usual game graphics. Interactive strategy is required to determine the action and outcome of each match. There are interviews with "Mean Gene" Okerlund and ringside commentary by Vince McMahon with one of the other wrestlers as co-host. Wrestling moves are chosen from a list on the sides of the screen by moving the highlight bar up and down the lists; one per player.

To say more would spoil the fun for true wrestling fans. Although I do not belong to that particular fan club, I did find the game interesting. My only regret was that it did not have any Von Erich's in it. (Yes, the names are familiar. My youngest is a wrestling fan, so I do know a few names and faces, and would much rather see local talent.)

For those of you that aren't interested in wrestling or the $25 or $30 price tag. the "bargain shelf" has a very interesting game for $7.95 called TIME TUNNEL by Celery Software. TIME TUNNEL is an adventure set in the magical forest of Central Scandinavia. The 350th birthday of the powerful Gnome King is quickly approaching and a sucessor to Cont. p4

Tony Velez, MCCC

I have been using(actually | was playing) a great BLACKJACK game for the c-128 with a 80 column (RGB) monitor. The game is public domain and in the MCCC library just waiting to be used and enjoyed.. It is from U.S. Arts Software Inc and written by Samsoc in August 1987.

The blackjack game is very well written, easy to use and if you know 'the rules of blackjack you won't need any docs, you just load and run the program. It follows all the rules of standard blackjack(as far as see). A few examples are,

- 2- The dealer will stand pat on 17 and have. 3- The house pays for 5 cards under 21

1- The dealer(computer) will hit 16 if you have more than 16 in your hand above regardless of what you

points.

Note: I don't know if the house pays double on 5 cards because I only did It once and I forgot how much I bet(also how much I had).

Note: The dealer will also let you continue to play even if it has you lucky??? blackjack(21). Not very nice but it's the dealers game.

After running the program you will notice 2 things, first the author loves colors, lots of colors and a very nice job he(or she) did with them. Second the dealer gaves you a whole $10,000.00 to start playing(wish the money was real).

On the top left corner of the opening screen it will say "How much do you want to bet" while on the lower right side you will see "Available cash" From this screen you will start the game by following the prompts.

First you bet, say about $1000.00 and then hit return. The screen will change and on the lower right you will now see that the amount you bet was substracted from your available cash.(It WiT! now said $9000.00). You can see the cards just like if you were playing blackjack for real.. On the left side of the screen you will see the dealers cards and all the information about its cards will be there. The right side of the screen has your cards and all the information about your cards.

You will be able to see only 1 of the dealers cards and just below the picture of the dealers card it will give you the total of all the exposed cards. On the right side you will see all your cards and their total. If you don't have a blackjack it will say "do you want another card (y/n). If you take another card and don't bust the dealer may take a card or stand pat. The results depend on how lucky you are but then thats where the fun is, are win or lose you will be prompted "would you like to play again (y/n)"

The dealer(computer) does have a sense of humor because at times it will talk to you. It says at times.....

* You must have your rabbits foot.
* Enough is enough, the house is getting mad if you keep winning I'll lose my job.
* Nice job, but don't get excited
- *Sorry you are busted.
* That's your last lucky hand

There may by others things that I have not found yet but I'm sure you would rather find them out yourself. Anyway this is a great game and l recommend it as a nice way to gamble without losing your money..

THE COMPUTER WIDOW I've watched the little monster move from back room to the little-used living Greater Omaha Commodore Users Group room, and finally to the family room, each move at my suggestion. I felt at least in the living room "Muffin" and I could watch the back of Jeff's head The latest move to the family room showed something significant. I had at last accepted the machine as part of the family. I resisted learning about it every step of the way. I had to be slamming cabinet doors. He's at it re-trained each time I sat down at the keyboard until it was imprinted in my thick head how to get anything to run. I often begrudged the money spent on updating, changing and improving the system as Jeff learned more. After awhile I became so dependant on the little monster that l'd be lost if something broke or the power wen: out. How did this happen?

It started with the obvious absence of Jeff right after dinner I was cleaning up the kitchen and from the back of the house! heard the irritating clicking of the keyboard as fingers searched and pecked. | feel my stomach churning into knots and I'm unconsiously again! The computer has him for the rest of the evening. Later on, I wander back to the far corner of the house and peek in to see Jeff's face aglow, reflecting in the screen, intense in GOTO's, and POKES's. I say for lack of anything better, "What are you doing?" Without taking his eyes off the screen he says, "Working out a program." watch as the seemingly foreign language scrolls on the screen and I realize that even if I did ask him to explain it all, l wouldn't understand it. I leave him to his obsession. After all...it's better than him hanging out at the bar, or race car driving, or... At least I know where he is. even if he's not really here.

Weeks later I hear giggles and shouts of glee coming from the back room. I go back to see three year old "Muffin" perched on a stool, joystick in hand, playing a game with her Daddy on the computer: I feel a twinge of jealousy as I realize she knows more about that "thing" than I do. Can I continue to allow this machine to come between me and my family? As "Mufffin" holds out the joystick to me, I figure if you can't beat 'em...

Three years and five computers later

Jeff is a patient and subtle person. He has a way of drawing a person in by way of his enthusiasm, gradually and with love - just like raising a child. My dear husband, instead of making me a widow, has made me a part of his life l thought l'd never understand (I still don't know alot of it). His patience and

hobby encircles the whole family. 1 wont say the computer has changed our lives, but because of its capabilities, our lives have broadened in areas beyond what we would have attempted without it. We've become dependant on it for newsletters, volunteer projects, correspondence, mailing lists, bookkeeping, schooling, and now even for Jeff's work. I was skeptical of it's value as an educational tool for our six year old, "Muffin," but have watched her improve on math skills because of the practice acquired on the computer. Besides the math program she uses spelling, science, beginning music, and continues to :. improve on motor developmnt. She's better at most of the games than I am because of her expertise with the joystick.

If you, too, have found yourself a computer widow, forget the dishes, turn off the TV, put down your work, give the kids something to do and go wrap your arms around your husband's neck. Ask him to teach you how to play "Jumpman." Tell him you'd like to know how to use the word processor. Show steady as some, find a beginner's computer course. Your efforts will pay as you are to enter a part of "his" world Jeff is a patient and subtle person. He closed to you before And it may even has a way of drawing a person in by way offer you self-satisfaction.

## HARDWARE CORNER Bill Hale New Mexico CU Group

Since our Monday meeting in January where I demonstrated my 1581 drive and having written an article about it,! discovered that, contrary to what stated, the 1581 is a double sided drive. I looked through a different part of my bifocals and used a better flashlight and saw the other head in the top of the drive. One of the reasons I thought the 1581 had only one head was that! read the manual's logical format description but skipped over the section on the physical format. The DOS ROM chip translates the format so that the 1581 appears as a single sided drive with 80 (1 to 80) tracks having forty 256 byte

## HARDWARE CORNER Cont

sectors (0 to 39) each. Internally the drive is formatted as a double sided (side 0 and side 1), 80 tracks per side (0 to 79), with ten 512 byte sectors per track (1 to 10). To the average user, this distinction matters very little, except, it DOES make a difference when it comes to what type of disks to use. With the 5 1/4 inch floppies, many people can get away with using both sides of disks certified as single sided, however, this isn't true of the 3 1/2 micro disks. In general, disks that are certified as single sided are only single sided. That second side won't format, so when you buy disks for this drive, be sure and buy DOUBLE sided, DOUBLE density disks. (The Amiga group carries these blank disks at a discount for members).

HOW TO MAKE AND USE 1750 RAM EXPANDER

: C128 RAM EXPANSION Bill Hale, New Mexico CU Group

I have always used the PaperClip to write my articles and am now using the latest version "PaperClip I!!". One of the features offered in this new version is that it allows you to use a RAM expander.

I now have the CD/ function installed in both the C128 and C64 modes allowing mie to move between sub-directories on the 1581. I still can't print to the screen in the 80 column mode, but the DOS channel to the drive is automatically opened so | Just type the print*15,"/" command. I find I can use the CD/ to perform other DOS commands such as "I" to initialize the drive or "U" to reset it by overwriting the "f" with these commands. I have also discovered that the "/" can be use in the monitor mode of the C128 by using "/" or "/ sub-directory name". With this you not only move to a different directory but a message is printed on the screen that tells you what partition area the drive is in

![Image](1988_05_artifacts/image_000007_d5561bfb5bf9dd42905127f773a8b6ce61b1ae54df915954e7293ac24d05288f.png)

· The C128 version (a separate disk is supplied for the C64 version) checks your computer for the presence of a RAM expander. If one is detected, a version of PaperClip is loaded that places overlays in the expander. These overlays are loaded into the computer only when they are needed such as spell checking, telecommunications, and printing documents. This method allows the computer's RAM to be used more efficiently. The dictionary in the spell checker is also stored in the expander so spelling is checked very quickly. Another option provides for spelling to be checked as you type in text.

I purchased the model 1700 expander instead of the model 1750 for two reasons: the 1700 cost $70 less than the 1750 and the company I was ordering from didn't have any 1750 in stock. | was also told by a former club member that converting a 1700 to a 1750 is very simple: all you have to do is cut one jumper path and replace the sixteen 4164 (64k by 1) dynamic RAM chips with 41256 (256 by 1) dynamic RAM chips. The cost of the parts including the IC sockets is about $50. (This conversion also saves you the time and expense

of sending in your warranty card since it comes with a demo disk that shows how will void any warranty.) Cutting the path motion pictures can be generated by was simple but unfortunately, the DRAM storing several stil! pictures (or frames) chips where not socketed so removing 16 in the RAM expander &amp; then rapidly IC'S, each with 16 pins &amp; inserting 16 "flipping" through them to create an sockets was not at all easy. Not only animated image. The bouncing ball where there 256 desoldering operations program checks first to see whether a to do, followed by 256 . soldering 1700 or 1750 is present &amp; will store operations, but the paths (traces or lands more pictures for smoother motion if it on the circuit board) are very thin and I detects a 1750 present.

There caution that in general, PC board traces are more commercial programs out now are notorious for peeling up during that use the expander in addition to handling and there is ALWAYS the danger PaperClip III, such as GEOS, so ! think my of damaging the IC'S through excess heat RAM expander was a good investment from the soldering iron or accidental rough handling when soldering is done directly on the board.) My conversion was ultimately successful, but I would not recommend trying it unless you have the proper tools and a static free work area plus some experience with soldering. (Being a bit of a nut also helps.)

Game-lovers and non-players alike enjoyed a demonstration of some of todays favorite games. We were very fortunate in having Software Terminal and Amazing Computer Systems present these programs for us. The continued support these dealers give to the Amiga community is one of the big reasons that Amiga is alive and well today and getting better all the time.

The above terms, and others, are ones that you should be familiar with when you get ready to buy a hard disk drive. Richard Bilyea of Software Terminal was the speaker at our last meeting and those of us who showed up (30 plus ) got a thorough description of these terms and what they mean. Richard also handed out a sheet of comparisons of several drive systems showing read and write times and some hints of what the 1.3 05 Fast Filing System will do to improve hard disk access times. Fantastic! Thanks Richard.

See what you miss by not showing up for a meeting? Not only that, you don't have a snowball's chance of winning the door prize that Software Terminal usually, and generously, provides. And if you are looking for PD software; well, the entire Amiga Chapter library is there every time. Just bring a blank DS/DD disk to swap for each disk that you want from the library All the latest info and help is available, too. Bring the spouse and kids). Your membership is a family membership. Make an evening of it.

Plans for an open workshop were announced at the April meeting. The first of these is planned for May 26, and will consist of members bringing their Amigas to the workshop so that they may receive hands-on help from a number of advisors who will be there to offer their knowledge and assist-ance. For anyone who has questions about anything (well, almost anything this is your chance. Don't be shy, this is for your benefit.

Our next meeting is May 19. We're looking forward to seeing everyone then Happy days, and keep that lightning away from your computers.

## Board of Directors Notes

John Malmstrom, Secretary

Our membership has reached the 300 milestone for the year. As of 4/15/88 the breakdown by chapters is as follows:

| Amiga Central -104      |     |
|-------------------------|-----|
| Amiga-by-the-Loop       | -33 |
| Arlington/Grand Prairie |  55 |
| Fort Worth Day -        |  26 |
| Fort Worth Night --     |  20 |
| H-E-B -                 |  64 |
| Total--                 | 302 |

The Board of Directors, meeting on April 2, acted upon the proposals which had been presented and tabled last month. Representatives from the Grand Prairie and Arlington chapters announced plans to merge their two chapters into one, to be called the Arlington/Grand Prairie chapter. The motion to dissolve the Grand prairie chapter was withdrawn. Representatives from the Fort Worth Night Chapter presented arguments supporting their desire to remain a separate chapter. After considerable discussion, a vote was taken, and the proposal to dissolve the Fort Worth Night Chapter failed by majority vote.
