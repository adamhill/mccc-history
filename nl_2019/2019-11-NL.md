## Three Categories of New Amigas

It's  kind  of  a  special  month  this time, not for Halloween or anything like  that,  but  that  we  have  some actual Amiga-related news this time  around.  In  the  events  realm, AmiWest (www.amiwest.net) is coming  up  on  October  23rd  thru the 27th, so if you're going to be in California  around  then,  it's  something to check out. If you're traveling even further, I hope you already left, because the Amiga 34 (www.amiga34.de) show in Neuss, Germany  happened  on  the  12th and 13th. This one is worth noting, as  it  is/was  the  debut  of  the  Vampire  V4  stand-alone  system,  with boards and pre-made systems first being  available  for  sale  there.  According to info I've read, it is using an early revision of the core/firmware which does not yet support all of the board's hardware features, but those will be addressed in future core updates. Finally, around the start of this month, the new 3.12 version of the MorphOS operating system for PowerPC  systems  and  Mac  hardware was released, offering a smattering of new features and updates. You  can  check  the  www.morphosteam.net  website  for  details  and downloads. I'm hoping to show it at the meeting if possible. Power Strip

All  this  frisky  talk  about  new  and updated Amiga (and related) hardware  and  operating  systems  has gotten  me  thinking  about  all  the various new forms the Amiga, or at

least things that want to occupy the same niches as the Amiga, have taken over the last several years since we  had  a  vacuum  in  place  of  an official  Amiga  leadership  position. As I see it, there are three primary approaches  to  a  'new  Amiga',  regardless of whether it exists in the form  of  true  hardware  or  emulation  on  another  system.  There  is plenty of cross-pollination and blend between the categories, but these three are how I define them.

First,  there  is  the  'Retro  Amiga.' This is pretty much a recreation of a  standard  common  Amiga  model, such as an A500 or A1200, for the primary purpose of running classic games, demos and software in the modern  day.  Motherboard  recreations and many emulation packages  look  to  this  goal.  While  it  can offer  enhancements  or  extra  features over a basic Amiga, that is not a priority. Second, there is  the 'High End Amiga.' This is meant to recreate and improve upon the features of the more powerful Amiga systems,  like  an  A4000  or  A1200 with  a  generous  amount  of  hardware  expansion.  Systems  like  the Vampire family  of  boards  fall  into this category. The goal here is to go beyond the capabilities of original Amiga hardware, yet retain as much compatibility with the classic system and its software as possible. Finally, there is the 'Future Amiga' which  works  to  push  the  Amigalike experience into something modern and more competitive with current  Windows,  Linux,  or  Mac systems.  These  are  more  focused on  the  operating  system  than  the

hardware  itself,  and  examples  include systems running Amiga OS4, MorphOS,  or  AROS.  Compatibility with  classic  Amiga  software  and applications  is  less  of  a  priority here, especially not 'metal banging' old apps like games or demos, but productivity software might be expected to run, though new software written  to  take  advantage  of  the new system is preferable.

As I stated, there is a lot of smear and cross-talk between these different types I've laid out, and I'm not here  (right  now)  to  say  which  approach is better, or which approach to each approach is better, but I will give my opinions for what I believe each  approach  should  offer  at  a minimum.

For the 'Retro Amiga,' and its primary  goal  of  playing  past  games and  software,  whether  by  emulation  or  recreation  of  classic  hardware, I believe that recreation should be as close and compatible as possible, so that 'metal-banging' software  would  have  no  idea  it wasn't running on a real Amiga 500. The goal should be accurate emulation  or  recreation,  as  opposed  to improving the specs of the original. The  improvements  come  in  the form of modern accessibility, such as being able to output to a current monitor of television, scaling up to HD resolutions as needed, and play its software from present drives or solid  state  media  rather  than  old floppy discs of failing reliability, using  disk  image  files  or  whatever formats  work  best.  The  ability  to swap easily between different hard- ware  profiles,  such  as  A500  or A1200, Kickstart 3.1 or 1.2, should be accessible as well. As the idea is to bring old Amiga games and software  to  the  present  day,  best  to remove as many hurdles as reasonable to that goal.

As  the  'High  End  Amiga'  concept represents  the  middle  ground  between 'retro' and 'future', its minimum  requirements  straddle  the two worlds. While it can't and probably shouldn't achieve the raw power of the bleeding edge, it should at least  significantly  improve  upon the  old  Amiga  high  end  of  something  like  the  Amiga  4000  with  a 68060  CPU  and  extra  video  card. However  it  should  also  retain  as much classic hardware compatibility as possible-not necessarily the cycle-accurate emulation  I  advocate on the 'Retro' end, but it should be able to handle the majority of old games and demos the way real  expanded Amiga users do, by using WHDLoad  to install and launch  them.  The  ability  to  use modern  displays,  modern  storage, and modern input devices like mice and game controllers are a necessity, with the updated hardware and operating  environment being able to make use of the available screen modes,  storage  and  audio  beyond the scope of legacy systems. It's for those  that  take  their  Amiga  usage seriously, though maybe not so seriously that they won't fire up Lemmings or Worms from time to time.

With  the  'Future  Amiga,'  compatibility with past Amiga applications is  limited  to  the  things  which  behaved nicely within the confines of the operating system, with old 'metal  banger'  software  requiring  running an emulator. Some schools of thought  believe  any  compatibility with  past  Amiga  software  should be dropped, as the Amiga API can hold back the full possible power of the  hardware  the  operating  systems  run  upon,  and  make  migrating  to  newer,  more  future-proof systems, such as Intel  or  ARMbased processors, more difficult.  I am against ditching the Amiga API entirely,  mostly  because  the  software  created  directly  for  OS4  or MorphOS  or  AROS  has  over  the years  not  taken  up  the  slack  and not filled the productivity hole that would be left if all the software for 68K-based Amigas were no longer available.  As  it  stands  though,  I think  the  current  'Future  Amiga' systems  are  all  nice  in  their  own niches and progressing well, if a bit slowly (expected for not being backed by huge software outfits). If they  can  progress  into  the  future without completely losing sight of the  past  Amiga  stuff,  they  will  be worth  my  time.  But  then  again, there will be the 'High End' and the 'Retro'  to  pick  up  that  ball  should the 'Future' drop it entirely.
