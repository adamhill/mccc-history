## Amiga and the Visual Effects Industry

Welcome  back  folks.  Spring  is  approaching,  and  retreating,  and  approaching,  much  like  waves  on  a shore. Our meeting will be on Saturday the 16 th , at the usual place and time. I hope to bring my Raspberry Pi to the meeting, to workshop some Amiga emulation  with  Amibian.  My end goal here is  to  learn  about  the top  end  of  what  is  possible  on  an emulated (on the Pi) Amiga system, and how it compares to the likes of a Vampire accelerated system, or even a PowerPC-based machine. I hope to see you there.

In my typical trawling of YouTube, I ran across a brief history of the Commodore (Amiga) CDTV, once listed in a  different video as one of the 'bottom ten' game consoles with the lowest sales numbers, a feat topped by Commodore's own C64-based game console. Of course the CDTV's problem was that it wasn't marketed as a game console, or a computer, but a 'home multimedia player' that looked like stereo equipment, made to beat the upcoming Philips CD-I at their own game. The problem was it was a game no one would win, as the public had little interest in CD-based multimedia  systems.  Even  though the CDTV had a lot of benefits, and even  advantages  over  its  competitors,  it  was  too  expensive  and  obscure to catch sales from the general public, while most Amiga fans at the time preferred to buy or expand the standard Amiga computers.

wouldn't mind having a CDTV for my shelf, however.

Another video I enjoyed talked about 90s  sci-fi  show  Babylon  5.  It's  well known  that  the  show  used  Amiga and  Video  Toaster  systems  to  produce  its  CG  effects  with  Lightwave 3D,  at  least  for  the  first  couple  of seasons. Later it would move much of that work to Pcs, when the Lightwave software was separated from the Video Toaster and ports to other systems were produced.

One thing I hadn't really thought that much  about  previously  is  the  Amiga's role in revolutionizing the visual effects  industry.  Back  in  the  day, spacecraft effects for science fiction films  and  television  were  made  using models and optical printing tech, an  expensive  option  and  a  limited resource,  depending  on  the  budget of  the  production.  You  might  see models and even whole shots reused frequently to save money. Computer graphics  came  to  be  used  more through the eighties and early nineties,  but  they  were  often  as  expensive as the traditional effects, if not more  so,  as  they  involved  workstations  such  as  Silicon  Graphics  machines, which cost tens of thousands of  dollars  each,  plus  technical  staff and  custom  software.  This  made computer graphics a similarly limited  resource,  especially  on  a  television budget.

When  the  Babylon  5  show  came about  with  scripts  calling  for  outer space scenes and battles that could stress a theatrical movie budget for

one episode, it was time to get innovative.  With  the  then-new  Video Toaster capable of TV-quality graphics and 3D animation, and a full Amiga Video Toaster system a fraction of the  cost  of  a  Silicon  Graphics  workstation, it was possible to buy multiple  Amigas  for  the  price  of  one  SG and farm their output to exceed the rendering throughput for the budget of the other means.

Other  effects  houses,  studios,  and individuals followed the example of Babylon 5's creators and effects studio Foundation Imaging. Computers and  software  both  improved  over time, and it became easily viable to produce quality CG effects using consumer-grade  systems.  Effects  of  all sorts became more common in television and lower-budget productions,  as  well  as  more  elaborate across the board.

The Amiga, being ahead of its time as a graphics and video production platform,  as  well  as  the  vessel  for  the Video Toaster and its associated Lightwave  3D  software,  helped  pioneer this trend much as it has in other  areas.  While  I  wouldn't  say  that Babylon 5 was the first  production with such effects production, or that such  a  trend  could  never  happen without the Amiga, it's clear the Amiga was an integral brick in the foundation for the modern landscape of computer graphics and visual effects.

## How Reliable are SSDs?

What's not to love about solid state drives (SSDs)? They are faster than conventional hard disk drives (HDDs), more compact, have no moving  parts,  are  immune  to  magnetic fields, and can withstand more shocks  and  vibration  than  conventional  magnetic  platter  disks.  And, they are becoming available in larger and larger capacities while their cost comes down.

If you've upgraded an older computer with an SSD, you no doubt instantly  saw  the  benefits.  Your  computer booted  in  less  time,  your  applications  loaded  faster,  and  even  when you  ran  out  of  memory,  and  apps and data had to be swapped to disk, it felt like everything was much snappier.

We're now seeing SSDs with capacities  that  used  to  be  reserved  for HDDs  and  at  prices  that  no  longer make our eyes water. 500 GB SSDs are  now  affordable  (under  $100), and 1 TB  drives are  reasonably priced  ($100  to  $150).  Even  2  TB SSDs fall into a budget range for putting  together  a  good  performance desktop system ($300 to $400).

We've written a number of times on this blog about SSDs, and considered the best uses for SSDs compared to HDDs. We've also written about the future of SSDs and how we use them in our data centers and whether we plan on using more in the future.

## Reliability

In this post we're going to consider the  issue  of  SSD  reliability.  For  all their  merits,  can  SSDs  be  trusted with your data and will they last as long or longer than if you were using an  HDD  instead?  You  might  have read that SSDs are limited to a finite number of reads and writes before they fail. What's that all about?

The bottom line question is: do SSD drives fail? Of course they do, as do all drives eventually. The important questions we really need to be asking  are  1)  do  they  fail  faster  than HDDs, and 2) how long can we reasonably expect them to last?

## Backing Up Is Great To Do

Of course, as a data storage and backup company, you know what we're going to say right off. We always recommend that no matter which storage  medium  you  use,  you  should always have a backup copy of your data. Even if the disk is reliable and in  good  condition,  it  won't  do  you any good if your computer is stolen, consumed by a flood, or lost in a fire or  other  act  of  nature.  You  might have heard that water damage is the most  common  computer  accident, and few computer components can survive a thorough soaking, especially when powered.

## SSD Reliability Factors to Consider

Generally,  SSDs  are  more  durable than HDDs in extreme and harsh environments because they don't have moving parts such as actuator arms. SSDs can withstand accidental drops and other shocks, vibration, extreme temperatures,  and  magnetic  fields better than HDDs. Add to that their small  size  and  lower  power  consumption,  and  you  can  understand why  they're  a  great  fit  for  laptop computers and mobile applications.

First,  let's  cover  the  basics.  Almost all  types  of  today's  SSDs  use  NAND flash  memory.  NAND  isn't  an  acronym  like  a  lot  of  computer  terms. Instead,  it's  a  name  that's  derived from its logic gate called "NOT AND." (For  the  curious,  a  NAND  gate  is  a logic  gate  that  produces  an  output that is false only if all its inputs are true. Digital systems employing logic circuits take advantage of the ability of a series of NAND gates to express any Boolean function.)

The term following NAND, flash, refers to a non-volatile solid state memory that retains data even when the power source is removed. NAND storage has specific  properties  that affect how long it will last. When data  is  written  to  a  NAND  cell  (also known  as  programming),  the  data must be erased before new data can be written to that same cell. NAND is programmed and erased by applying a voltage to send electrons through an  insulator.  The  location  of  those electrons (and their quantity) determine  when  current  will  flow  between a source and a sink (called a voltage threshold), determining the data  stored  in  that  cell  (the  1s  and 0s). When writing and erasing NAND, it  sends  the  electrons  through  the insulator and back, and the insulator starts to wear-the exact number of these  cycles  in  each  individual  cell varies  by  NAND  design.  Eventually, the  insulator  wears  to  the  point where it may have difficulty keeping the  electrons  in  their  correct  (programmed) location, which makes it increasingly  more  difficult  to  determine if the electrons are where they should be, or if they have migrated on their own.

This means that flash type memory cells  can  only  be  programmed  and erased  a  limited  number  of  times. This is measured in P/E cycles, which  stands  for  programmed  and erased.

P/E  cycles  are  an  important  measurement of SSD reliability, but there are other factors that are important to  consider,  as  well.  These  are  P/E cycles, TBW (terabytes written), and MTBF (mean time between failures).

The SSD manufacturer will  have these specifications available for their products and they can help you understand how long your drive can be  expected  to  last  and  whether  a particular drive is suited to your application.

P/E cycles -A  solid-state-storage program-erase cycle is a sequence of events  in  which  data  is  written  to solid-state NAND flash memory cell, then erased, and then rewritten. How many P/E cycles a SSD can endure varies with the technology used, somewhere between 500 to 100,000 P/E cycles.

TBW -Terabytes written is the total amount of data that can be written to an SSD before it is likely to fail. For example, here are the TBW warranties  for  the  popular  Samsung  860 EVO SSD: 150 TBW for 250 GB model, 300 TBW for 500 GB model, 600 TBW for 1 TB model, 1,200 TBW for 2 TB model and 2,400 TBW for 4 TB model. Note: these models are warrantied for 5 years or TBW, whichever comes first.

MTBF -MTBF (mean time between failures) is a measure of how reliable a hardware product or component is over its expected lifetime. For most components, the measure is typically in thousands or even tens of thousands of hours between failures. For example, a hard disk drive may have a  mean  time  between  failures  of 300,000 hours, while an SSD might have 1.5 million hours.

This doesn't mean that your SSD will last that many hours, what it means is, given a sample set of that model of SSD,  errors  will  occur  at  a  certain rate. A 1.2 million hour MTBF means that if the drive is used at an average of  8  hours  a  day,  a  sample  size  of 1,000  SSDs  would  be  expected  to have one failure every 150 days, or about twice a year.

## SSD Types

There  are  a  number  of  different types  of  SSD,  and  advancements  to the  technology  continue  at  a  brisk pace.  Generally,  SSDs  are  based  on four  different  NAND  cell  technologies:

- SLC (Single Level Cell)-one bit per cell

When one bit is stored (SLC), it's not necessary to keep close tabs on  electron  locations,  so  a  few electrons  migrating  isn't  much of a concern. Because only a 1 or a 0 is being stored, it's necessary only  to  accurately  determine  if voltage flows or not.

- MLC (Multi-Level Cell)-two bits per cell

MLC stores two bits per cell, so more precision is needed (determining voltage threshold is more complex). It's necessary to distinguish among 00, 01, 10 or 11. Migrating electrons have more of an impact, so the insulator  cannot be worn as much as with SLC.

- TLC  (Triple  Level  Cell)-three bits per cell

This  trend  continues  with  TLC where three bits are stored: 001, 010,  100,  110  and  111.  Migrating  electrons  have  more  effect than  in  MLC,  which  further  reduces tolerable insulator wear.

- QLC  (Quad  Level  Cell)-four bits per cell

QLC stores four bits (16 possible combinations of 1s and 0s). With QLC,  migrating  electrons  have the most significant effect. Tolerable insulator wear is further reduced.

QLC is a good fit for read-centric workloads  because  NAND  cells are  worn  negligibly  when  reading data versus worn more when writing data (programming and erasing).  When  writing  and  rewriting a lot of data, the insulator wears  more  quickly.  If  a NAND cell can tolerate that wear, it  is  well  suited  to  read/write mixed  accesses.  The  less  weartolerable NAND cells are, the better they are suited for read-centric workloads and applications.

Each subsequent technology for NAND allows it to store an extra bit. The  fewer  bits  per  NAND  cell,  the faster, more reliable, and more energy  efficient  the  technology  is-and also,  more  expensive.  A  SLC  SSD

would  technically  be  the  most  reliable  SSD  as  it  can  endure  more writes, while a QLC is the least reliable. If you're selecting an SSD for an application where it will be written more than read, then the selection of NAND cell technology could be a significant  factor  in  your  decision.  If your application is general computer use, it likely will matter less to you.

## How Reliability Factors Affect Your Choice of SSD

How important these factors are to you depends on how the SSD is used. The  right  question  to  ask  is  how  a drive  will  perform  in  your  application. There are different performance and reliability criteria depending on whether the SSD will be used in a home desktop computer, a data center, or an exploration vehicle on Mars.

Manufacturers sometimes specify the type of application workload for which  an  SSD  is  designed,  such  as write-intensive, read-intensive or mixed-use. Some vendors allow the customer to select the optimal level of endurance and capacity for a particular  SSD.  For  instance,  an  enterprise  user  with  a  high-transaction database might opt for a higher number of drive writes at the expense of capacity. Or a user operating a database  that  does  infrequent  writes might  choose  a  lower  drive  writes number and a higher capacity.

## Signs of SSD Failure

SSDs  will  eventually  fail,  but  there usually are  advance  warnings  of when that's going to happen. You've likely encountered the dreaded clicking sound that emanates from a dying  HDD.  An  SSD  has  no  moving parts,  so  we  won't  get  an  audible warning that an SSD is about to fail us.  You  should  be  paying  attention for a number of indicators that your SSD is nearing its end of life, and take action by replacing that drive with a new one.

## 1) Errors Involving Bad Blocks

Much  like bad sectors  on  HDDs, there are bad blocks on SSDs. This is typically  a  scenario  where  the  computer attempts to read or save a file, but  it  takes  an  unusually  long  time and  ends  in  failure,  so  the  system eventually  gives  up  with  an  error message.

## 2) Files Cannot Be Read or Written

There are two ways in which a bad block can affect your files, 1) the system detects the bad block while writing data to the drive, and thus refuses to write data, and 2), the system detects the bad block after the data  has  been  written,  and  thus  refuses to read that data.

## 3) The File System Needs Repair

Getting  an  error  message  on  your screen  can  happen  simply  because the  computer  was  not  shut  down properly, but it also could be a sign of an SSD developing bad blocks or other problems.

## 4) Crashing During Boot

A crash during the computer boot is a sign that your drive could be developing  a  problem.  You  should  make sure you have a current backup of all your  data  before  it  gets  worse  and the drive fails completely.

## 5) The Drive Becomes Read-Only

Your drive might refuse to write any more data to disk and can only read data.  Fortunately,  you  can  still  get your data off the disk.

SSDs Generally Will Last As Long As You Need Them To

Let's  go  back  to  the  two  questions we asked above.

Question 1: Do SSDs fail faster than HDDs?

Answer:  That  depends  on  the technology  of the  drives  and how they're used. HDDs are better suited for some applications and SSDs for others. SSDs can be expected to last as long or longer than HDDs in most general applications.

Question 2: How long can we reasonably expect an SSD to last?

Answer:  An  SSD  should  ideally last  as  long  as  its  manufacturer expects it to last (e.g. five years), provided  that  the  use  of  the drive  is  not  excessive  for  the technology it employs (e.g. using a  QLC  in  an  application  with  a high number of writes). Consult the  manufacturer's  recommendations to ensure that  how you're using the SSD matches its best use.

SSDs are a different breed of animal than  a  HDD  and  they  have  their strengths  and  weaknesses  relative to  other  storage  media.  The  good news is that their strengths-speed, durability, size, power consumption, etc.-are backed by pretty  good overall reliability.

SSD users are far more likely to replace  their  storage  drive  because they're ready to upgrade to a newer

technology, higher capacity, or faster drive,  than  having  to  replace  the drive due to a short lifespan. Under normal use we can expect an SSD to last  years.  If  you  replace  your  computer every three years, as most users  do,  then  you  probably  needn't worry about whether your SSD will last as long as your computer. What's important is whether the SSD will be sufficiently reliable that you won't lose your data during its lifetime.

As  we  saw  above,  if  you're  paying attention to your system, you will be given ample warning of an impending drive failure, and you can replace the drive before the data is not readable.

It's good to understand how the different  SSD  technologies  affect  their reliability, and whether it's worth it to  spend  extra  money  for  SLC  over MLC or QLC. However, unless you're using an SSD in a specialized application with more writes than reads as we described above, just selecting a good  quality  SSD  from  a  reputable manufacturer  should  be  enough  to make  you  feel  confident  that  your SSD will have a useful life span.

Keep an eye out for any signs of failure or bad sectors, and, of course, be sure to have a solid backup plan no matter what type of drive you're using.
