The New Raspberry Pi Is Basically a $35 Desktop Computer

It's rare to come across a bespoke gadget or a cleverly hacked device that doesn't have a tiny Raspberry Pi inside it. It's long been one of the

pair of micro HDMI ports on the Pi 4,  allowing  the  tiny  computer  to power a pair of 4K displays at 30 frames per second, or a single  4K display  at  60  frames  per  second, thanks to the board now adopting developer Eric Anholt's Mesa V3D graphics  driver.  Onboard  you'll  also find a pair of USB 2.0 ports and a pair of USB 3.0 ports, but microUSB is nowhere to be seen. It's been re- easiest and cheapest ways to power a custom creation, but the  new Raspberry Pi, announced earlier  today,  packs  significant upgrades that could let it finally pass as an incredibly cheap desktop computer.

That's not to say  you should  be  kicking  yourself for spending $1,000+  on  a  new  desktop  workstation.  At  $35, the new Raspberry Pi 4 is the last thing you'll want to  rely  on  for  tasks  like Photoshop, video editing, or  gaming.  But  it's  now packing  a  Broadcom  1.5 GHz ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core processor and the option to step  up from 1GB of faster LPDDR4 RAM to 2GB for $45, or 4GB for $55,

Originally  designed  as  both  a  tool for tinkerers and those wanting to learn  more  about  how  computers work, the Raspberry Pi has become an  essential  tool  for  industrial  applications, according to the company. The latest iteration of the hardware has many upgrades that have  come  at  the  request  of  business customers specifically, including improved I/O speeds across the

which should go a long way to making  the  Pi  4  more  viable  as  a  web browsing and email machine straight out of the box.

The Raspberry Pi 3's standard sized HDMI port has been upgraded to a board.  But  in  an  interview with the Next Web, Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton promises that education is still part of the company's focus. 'While our sales into education are smaller than  into  industry,  we still estimate we sold over 1 million units into that market in 2018 alone,'  he  claimed.  Upton also believes, 'What's changed with Raspberry Pi 4 is that in addition to being a device for  learning  about  computing, it's also  much more  suitable than its predecessors for use as a general-purpose classroom computer.'

To that end, the Raspberry  Pi  4  will  also  include some welcome operating placed  with  a  power-only  USB-C port,  adding  an  extra  500  mA  of juice.  On  the  wireless  front,  the Raspberry  Pi 4's Bluetooth  has been upgraded to the 5.0 standard, and WiFi now supports dual-band 802.11ac.

system upgrades that will be based on the upcoming release of Debian 10 Buster. The polished UI should be  less  intimidating  to  those  already familiar with commercial OS products like Windows and MacOS, and that also goes for the included

As  the  brains  powering  your  next highly customized smart home upgrade,  the  Raspberry  Pi  4  seems like an easy choice. It remains to be seen, however, how viable the hardware will be as a basic desktop machine (will it be able to run Windows 10 S like other barebones systems?),  but  the  updated  specs seem to indicate that the Pi might have finally graduated from being a tool for just hackers, hobbyists, and tinkerers.

so that the C64 Mini could capitalize  on  the  popularity  of  miniaturized  throwback  consoles  like  the NES and SNES Classic Editions from Nintendo. It did an admirable job  at  bringing  a  collection  of  64 classic games to modern TVs, but it was a bring-your-own-keyboard affair if you wanted to try your hand at coding in BASIC again.

## C64 Clone With Keyboard

The most disappointing thing about the  miniature  Commodore  64  released  last  year  was  that  its  tiny keyboard  didn't  actually  work-it was just for show. Those cryptically  labeled  dirt-brown  keys  were one of  the  most  iconic  features  of the C64 back in the '80s. But come December,  the  C64  Mini  will  be joined  by  another  Commodore  64 replica,  this  time  with  a  full  sized and fully functional keyboard.

Retro Games' The C64 was originally  announced  way  back  in  2016 but at the time, its Indiegogo crowdfunding  campaign  failed  to  reach its funding goal. It was put on hold ed to modern TVs, but it maxes out at  720P,  so  don't  expect  to  finally be able to play Impossible Mission in 4K. It also includes the same collection of games that the C64 Mini has,  but  to  improve  gameplay  the accurately awful throwback joystick has been upgraded with new micro switches, so hopefully, it's a little more responsive than its predecessor.

The C64, as the new console is simply known, has the same footprint as the original Commodore 64 that was  first  released  back  in  1982. The keyboard appears to have the same  layout  (and  hopefully  uses key switches that emulate the feel of the original's) and that glorious beige  finish  that  screams,  'boring

In addition to its bundled collection of  classic  games,  users  can  plug  a flash  drive  into  one  of  The  C64's four  USB  ports  (the  C64  Mini  had just  two)  and  load  any  C64  or VIC20  ROM they  feel  was  unfairly overlooked for inclusion. And, yes, in  true  C64 fashion, you'll have to

load  those  ROMS using  the  proper BASIC syntax. LOAD '*',8,1

Retro  Games  has pegged December 5, 2019, as the day  The  C64  will officially ship, and  it  will  come with a price tag of around $120,

'80s computer.' It also comes with BASIC  pre-installed,  and  it  can  be switched between modes that make it function like the classic C64, or  even  its  predecessor,  the  Commodore Vic 20.

But  that's  where  the  similarities end. The new C64 includes an HDMI port so it can be easily connect-

which is definitely more expensive than the C64 Mini, but that working keyboard will go a long way to recreating the original Commodore experience for nostalgia seekers.
