## My New Raspberry Pi

As mentioned in last month's newsletter, Johnny Kitchens donated two Raspberry Pi computers to be given away at the September meeting. Mark Stodola won the Raspberry Pi  3B  and  Bill  Raecke  (yours  truly)  won  the  4B.  You shoulda been there!

Below is a photo of my new Pi in its new home. I have it wired to the same monitor as my Windows machine via an HDMI switch-a press of a button lets me see either display. (That's the Pi display in the photo.) I installed an Ethernet switch as well (located under the desk) so that both PC and Pi are hard-wired to the Internet. And off to the left is a power strip with an off/on switch so that I don't have to unplug and plug the Pi to turn it on. (In case you're wondering, the PC is behind the monitor.)

Now I just have to figure out what I'm going to do with it. I have managed to get it to print to my network printer. That was a more difficult process than expected. I found several  sources  on  the  Internet  giving  instructions  on how to set it up, but none worked as advertised. I had to pick my way through using pieces of each set of instructions while paying close attention to what was going on. But all's well that ends well.

Next up: I need to set up a program that automatically switches desktop backgrounds and I need a screen-saver.

## Things Change and I'm An Old Crank

Welcome to yet another month with our Amigas. There hasn't been a ton of news lately, at least not that I've seen. On the other hand, there have been a handful of newsworthy pieces of Amiga-related video that I can share with the class.

Recently my Samsung tablet updated its Android operating system. Not surprisingly, I wasn't particularly pleased with several of the changes from the last version. I don't know why graphics or text fonts need to be changed, why the  noise  it  makes  when  a  cable  is  plugged  in  is  now different, or why the screen now actively expends energy to show you the tablet is charging. Seems like most updates over the tablet's history were things I didn't like until I got used to and learned to tolerate with time. This pattern got me thinking about how much of an old crank I've become with regards to technology.

I've been with the Amiga in one sense or another since I was a teenager. I got my first Amiga around the end of 1988, marking a little over thirty years with the platform, and I've gotten to be an old man in that time, at least in relative terms. One thing I've come to realize is how much of  a  luddite  I've  turned  into  over those  years.  Certainly  I'm  not  completely anti-technology-the amount of time I spend with my Android tablet  and  YouTube can testify to thatbut there are definitely aspects of my life where I have passed on the new paradigms  and  stuck  with  the  old crap for some  reason. I've  been known to pass on online or automated bill payments in favor of writing a paper check. I like the idea of owning a movie I want on an actual physical DVD or Blu-Ray disc, rather than just downloading  or  streaming,  preferring  to  not  be  at  the  mercy  of  the whims of the servers and DRM providers, despite the bulk of the market moving away from real media. I may be one out the five or six people on the planet currently without a smartphone,  instead  using  a  basic  cell phone for a mere 20 dollars per three months and letting the tablet handle much of the other stuff I might use the smarty-phone for.

Finally, the big one is that I still use Amiga and MorphOS systems regularly. While I have access to other, newer  systems,  I  stick  with  the  Amiga and  relatives  for  much  of  my  work, out  of  my  own  preference.  While  I use a Linux system out of necessity (or web convenience), I've worked to tweak  the  window  manager  to  put the window buttons in the same places  as  the  Amiga  has  them,  as  God intended.  I  remember  old  polls  asking what interface people preferred between  Windows  and  Mac,  and  always wondered why Windows usually took the  majority.  With  some perspective  and  hindsight,  I  understand better why that is, and it boils down to familiarity. Windows users prefer Windows, because that's what they're used to using, as opposed to some objective  sense  of  superiority. The  same  is  said  for  Mac  or  Linux users, and of course my own preference  for  Amiga-based  systems.  I'm used to working on my Amiga hardware and using Amiga software, so I stick to using said hardware and software where I can. It may not necessarily be the ideal option in a modern world, but it is what it is.

It's not without drawbacks of course, with the more obvious being compatibility  between  aging  systems  and the  modern world. Amiga and-related  users,  especially  those  keeping their 'classic' hardware chugging along, are constantly looking for options to connect to monitors or printers  or  other  things  that  never  had their system in mind when they were built,  leading  to  a  market  for  new hardware  or  software  to  facilitate these connections.

To  give  my  own  example,  I  had  a Hewlett Packard flatbed scanner that I  constantly used on my Amiga, and only my Amiga, as it used a SCSI connection which my more modern machines  didn't  use.  It  was  nice  and could  scan  pages  larger  than  letter size, a feature I used frequently, but over  years  of  use  the  scanner  grew temperamental and unreliable. I could still coax it to usefulness when I  had to, but the writing was on the wall. The problem here was you can't just get a new scanner for the same reason you can't just get a new printer or monitor. You have to figure out exactly what you will need, how you

will  use  it,  and  what  system(s)  you will be able to use it on, if any. Most of today's scanners use USB connections, and while USB connectivity is more common in Amigas now, finding the right combination of scanner and  driver  that  actually  works  is much more challenging. I've had little  luck  getting  three  different  USB scanners to work correctly on a MorphOS  system,  despite  the  easy  USB connection and drivers included with the SCANdal software package. Also,  it  was  surprisingly  difficult  to find  a  USB  scanner  with  a  large enough bed to scan legal-size pages in one go, at least not without spending out the dumper. In light of all this, sometimes  you  find  it's  better  to 'slum it' and get exactly what works, instead  of  the  newer,  'better'  stuff that 'should' work.

Through Ebay, I found and bought a factory refurbished HP SCSI scanner of  roughly the same type as my old one  (a  little  higher-speced,  in  fact), and it works just like the old one did in its heyday, if not better. I hope to get  years  of  use  out  of  it,  assuming the  old  Amiga  that  drives  it  keeps going. Perhaps I'll have to get a SCSI card for one of my other systems to keep the scanner supported now that I've done the opposite. Maybe I'll get SCSI scanners for all the systems, as I have better luck with them thus far. The only issue then is making room, as these HP legal scanners are monster-sized!
