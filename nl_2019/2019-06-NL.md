## Home Computers vs. Game Consoles

Welcome to another month. Things have  been  pretty  uneventful,  as long  as  you  don't  watch  the  news too closely. I don't have much in the way of  Amiga  news  right  now,  so I'll  offer  the  next  best  thing  (or  a better  thing,  depending  on  your outlook)-interesting and entertaining Amiga-related YouTube video links.

Perhaps  more  so  in  recent  years than  before,  I  have  become  a  student of the history of video games

and  computers.  The  more  I  learn, the more I understand how the forces  of  history  shaped  our  favorite system. Most of us, especially those who lived  through  it,  knew  about the great video game market crash of 1983/4. As Amiga fans may also know, Jay Miner's Amiga hardware design  started  as  something  that could have been either a game console  or  a  full  computer  (and  has been  pushed  as  both  in  different times).

I recently learned the Amiga's spiritual ancestor, the Atari 8-bit series was  designed  the  same  way,  and perhaps  the  only  reason  the  lowend  Atari  400  had  a  simple  keyboard  is  because  the  'killer  app' Star  Raiders game was pretty useless without one.

Anyway, the North American video game  crash  happened  while  the Amiga was still being designed, and as  the  market  shifted  its  interest from game consoles to home computers  (before  Nintendo  shifted  it back a few years later), the Amiga's design  shifted  with  it.  The  crash also pushed the early Amiga company  to  seek  financial  aid  from  'big fish'  like  Atari  and  later  Commodore,  as  they  originally  hoped  to support  the  Amiga  project  thru sales of Atari games and peripherals (such as the 'Joyboard'), but that rug  was  pulled  out  from  under them.

It's  hard  to  say  exactly  how,  or  in what  form,  the  Amiga  hardware would have found its  way  to  market if  the  Amiga company had the

Dallas resources  to  do  most  of  the  work on their own.

Most people also know that the video  game  and  computer  markets were different in other lands, such as  Europe  and  Japan.  What  some here  may  not  realize  is  the  Great Video Game Crash was not a global phenomenon, but mostly contained within  North  America.  This  was mainly  because  the  different  markets  were  different.  Japan's  game market was relatively self-contained at the time, and systems like the Atari 2600VCS, Intellivision, or Colecovision barely made a ripple there.

Places like the UK and Europe were interesting  in  that,  from  a  gaming standpoint,  they  made  little  to  no distinction  between  a  'home  computer' or 'game console' over there. The USA, on the other hand, seemed  to  almost  have  a  phobia about treating computers like game machines, even if that was all their  users  might  have  done  with them. The crash probably had something  to  do  with  that.  Still, most  US  home  computer  advertising  in  the  mid-eighties  was  some variation  of  'Sure,  it  plays  great games, but you can use it to do your homework / writing / accounting too?'

The Amiga was treated no differently here, with what little marketing the system got touting its power as a  business  and  creativity  machine that  can  probably  also  play  some games, and priced the A1000 as a 'serious' system, before the split to

the 2000 and 500 a couple of years later.

Europe was different, and a 'cheap and cheerful' Sinclair ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, or Commodore 64 loading games from a cassette tape was just  as  viable  a  'console'  as  some cartridge-based  machine,  perhaps more so as it was an easier environment  for  some  enterprising  'bedroom  coder'  to  come  up  with  a game idea of their own to possibly make it big. It's worth noting that Nintendo's  NES  barely  scratched this  market  while  it  was  utterly dominating the US.

This  was  the  environment  where the Amiga thrived. Well, it did after the Amiga 500 came out and took the spotlight back after the budgetconscious Atari ST beat out the 'serious'  A1000.  It's  part  of  why  the Amiga is sometimes regarded as a 'European' system despite its American design, and how it found most of its success there, even after Commodore went under in 1994…that's where the games came from, for all practical purposes.

As  the  Demo  Party  links  above show, the  Amiga  is  still  a  popular subject for demo wizardry even today. As time goes on, the world markets got more global, and much of the video game market is a bit more samey across the world now, with the  same  PC,  Nintendo,  Sony,  and X-Box pretty much everywhere (though X-Box isn't too big in Japan from some reason).

The  forces  of  history  shaped  the Amiga's creation, the forces of markets  showed  where  it  would  succeed, where it would fail,  and where it would eventually end as a contender in the game and computer markets. It's easy to be nostalgic for  those  days.  Things  might  be more powerful now, but back then you could at least tell the different systems  apart  just  by  looking  at them.
