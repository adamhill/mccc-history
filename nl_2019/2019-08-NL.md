## A New Amiga 1200 Motherboard

If you go out and buy a computer right now, how many choices do you really have? Generally speaking, there's PC or Mac.  If  we  were  being  generous  you could  consider  Chromebook  and  perhaps even mobile, but let's be honest, computing is a two-party system with the  ability  to  dump  the  OS  and  run Linux  as  the  obvious  third-party  disrupter. It wasn't always like this.

In the early years of personal computing  there  were  a  slew  of  serious  contenders.  A  PC,  a  Mac,  an  Atari  ST,  an Amiga,  and  several  more  that  all  demanded serious consideration  on  the general purpose desktop  computer market. Of all these platforms, the Amiga somehow stubbornly refuses to die. The Amiga 1200+ from [Jeroen Vandezande] is the latest in a long procession of post-Commodore Amigas, and as its name suggests it provides an upgrade for the popular early-1990s all-in-one Amiga model.

It  takes  the  form  of  a  well-executed open-source  PCB  that's  a  drop-in  replacement for the original A1200 motherboard.  CPU,  RAM,  and  video  are broken out onto daughterboards, with PCMCIA  replaced  by  an  SD  card  slot. The  catch:  it  does  require  all  the  custom Amiga chips from a donor board.

The original Amiga 1200 was a significant upgrade to the architecture of the 1980s originals, and this certainly provides a much-needed enhancement to its  underwhelming  68EC020  processor. It's fair to say that this is the Amiga upgrade we'd all have loved to see in about  1996  rather  than  waiting  until 2019. It's still a delight for a retro-gaming  enthusiast;  many  of  those  who keep it alive remember the Amiga was

## Computers and Game Consoles

As  usual,  I  have  been  browsing  YouTube for Amiga stuff, and here are my selection(s)  for  this  month:  First,  we have a video featuring the recovery of data from one of the Amiga 4000 systems used during the development of the  well-known  game  from  Team  17, 'Worms.'

Building  from  there,  taking  the  Lightwave 3D files from the Worms CD cut scenes, and remaking them in HD resolutions.

The 3D animations featured in the videos were originally created for the CD32 release of Worms. (And presumably other  computer  and  console  ports  of the  game  that  ran  from  CD  or  other media  with  the  storage  capacity  for animated  cut-scenes,  as the  floppybased releases didn't bother.)

This got me thinking about my favorite game console, the Atari 78… the Amiga CD-32. A recurring theme in the history of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s is  the  cross-pollination  between  full home computer systems and the consoles designed primarily to play games. In the eighties, there were a lot of proposed hardware solutions to expand a game  machine  into  a  full  computer. Surprisingly  few  of  them  made  it  to completion,  due  in  part  to  the  North

American video game crash of 1983-4 and more to the dedicated home computer  market  getting  more  powerful for  barely  any  more  cost  than  one  of the  hypothetical  console  expansions. Later  on,  the  reverse  became  more common, taking the guts of an existing home computer design and modifying and/or simplifying it into a game console form.

One of the first examples of this would come from Atari, with their 5200 console and later XEGS system both based on their 8-bit home computer technology, though it can be argued that their home computers had a game console application in mind from the beginning. (supposedly  the  1979  Atari  400  computer got its basic keyboard mainly so it  could  do  the  complex  controls  required  by  'killer  app'  game  Star  Raiders,  which  may  also  be  part  of  the reason  the  Atari  5200  console  had those monster keypad controllers.) This  is  an  idea  that  makes  sense  on paper-Lots of money is saved adapting  an  existing  hardware  design  to  a new potential market, and there is already a pool of developers or even existing  software  which  can  quickly  be made available to its library.

In  practice  though,  the  console-fromcomputer paradigm is rarely a big success. Part this is the fact that these computer manufacturers are jumping into a  market  with  veteran  game  console makers, and can't find their footing fast enough on a new playing field. The rest is that the people already familiar with their  brand  will  probably  prefer  the more versatile and established computer over the limited game console, especially if the console doesn't have much new  to  offer  over  the  computer  it's based upon. Companies such as Atari and Amstrad have tried this route before, with varying levels of success or abject failure.

Commodore  may  well  be  the  king  of the concept, thanks in no small part to their  constant  short-sighted  pursuits of quick profits over long-term growth, trying  the  console  route  no  less  than three (or two and a half) times over its history, if you don't count the Commodore MAX machine, a low-end precursor  to  the  C64  that  went  to  foreign markets. There was the C64GS, literally  a  C64  motherboard  sans  keyboard with  the  cartridge  slot  moved  from back to top. According to some sources, the  GS  was  one  of  the  worst-selling game consoles of all time, though not actually as big a loss for Commodore as it  could  have  been,  as  the  64GS  guts could  simply  be  broken  up  and  put back in 'real' C64 cases for sale.

Next up was Commodore's CDTV, based largely on the Amiga 500 system. This was not intended as a game console,  but  a  'multimedia  CD  player'  to compete with the CD-1 from Philips in a market that never materialized. Still, it  played  games  as  well  as  any  A500 (and probably better than the average CD-I), could be expanded into 'full computer'  status  easily  with  a  keyboard and disc drive, and had abysmal sales numbers,  though  not  as  bad  as  the 64GS. It ran into that problem where the Amiga people would rather have a regular (and often cheaper) Amiga system, and the rest didn't know what to do with it  at  all,  though  to  be  fair  no one really  knew  what  to  do  with Philips' machine either.

You'd  think  two  failures  would  cause Commodore to stop trying to turn computers  into  consoles,  but  they  did  it one more time, pairing the guts of an Amiga 1200 with a CD-ROM drive and a  new chip here or there, making the Amiga  CD-32.  While  the  system  was not a huge success, even blocked from an official release in the USA thanks to a  patent-trolling  lawsuit,  it  was  the most successful of Commodore's game consoles by far, even being a top seller in  the  UK  for  a  time,  thanks  to  actual good marketing. It was not enough to save Commodore from bankruptcy in 1994  however,  and  conventional  wisdom says the CD-32's days were numbered regardless, as heavy-hitter systems like the Sony Playstation were about  to  hit  the  market  like  a  ton  of Japanese  bricks.  It  was  a  good  time while it lasted though.

While  the  Amiga  CD-32  was  basically an Amiga 1200 at heart, it had a builtin CD-ROM drive (hence the name) and games and other titles for it were distributed on CD. It also had the 'Akiko' chip,  which  was  CD  control  circuitry combined with hardware to accelerate 'chunky-to-planar' calculations, intended to help 3D and pseudo-3D games in the vein of Doom. Exactly how effective this hardware was,  or  how  many games made good use of it is difficult to say, but there didn't seem to be a lot of apparent improvement. Even though it had a pretty short shelf life, the CD-32 had  a  pretty  strong  library  of  games, thanks to its Amiga hardware and the concept of 'shovelware.' For those not in  the  know,  'shovelware'  is  porting existing  software  or  games  over  to  a new system with minimal, if any changes or improvements to fit the new machine. All any Amiga software developer had to do was take their old A1200  game  (or even older  A500 game) and tweak it to run from a CD instead of a series of floppy discs. (and hopefully  be  playable  without  requiring a keyboard) There are even examples of one-floppy games put out as CD versions with no changes at all, which

obviously is not making the most of the larger storage medium, not to mention that enigmatic Akiko chip.

Some producers tried to add some value to the CD version, even if the game itself  was  still  identical  to  the  floppy disc  release,  adding  or  expanding  the introductory  animated  sequences  or cut-scenes, or using the CD audio for a music soundtrack superior to what the Amiga could play back unaided. Others used  the  shovelware  concept  to  add value, and simply put multiple games on one CD in a collection format, making good value for money. That's not to say every CD-32 game was a basic conversion of an  older  Amiga  game,  even  though many  were.  There  were  some  games that  made  proper  use  of  the  system and CD storage, or developed primarily  for  use  on  the  CD-32,  causing  any versions to appear on floppy-based systems  to  be  cut  back.  Adventure  titles seemed to make better use of the CD system, having wider areas to explore or full voice tracks instead of text for speaking characters, for example.

While shovelware wasn't ideal for the CD-32, the bright side is the majority of the  better-known  and  popular  games from  the  Amiga's  history  were  made available for it, and if that's not enough, you can track down an expansion like the  old  SX-1  or  SX-32,  or  the  newer Terriblefire to bump the machine up to 'full computer' status with added RAM, hard drive, and optional floppy, hook it to  an  RGB  monitor,  and  let  software take care of the rest, making the computer to  game console and game console to computer circle complete.
