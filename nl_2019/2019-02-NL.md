## Trevor Dickinson Speaks

Trevor Dickinson, the boss of A-EON Technology, posted on December 22, 2018  a  post  on  his  personal  blog  . Here is a summary of the interesting information he tells:

## AmiWest

- He  took  part  in  the  AmiWest show in October 2018. And, like two years ago, his rental car was robbed , the ruffians having broken  the  rear  window  (  photo  ). Car  burglaries  are  an  epidemic in the San Francisco area.
- Daniel Müssener, the developer at Cherry Darling, lost all his belongings in this robbery. He had to buy new clothes and a computer  to  recreate  his  presentation and  speech  for  the  AmiWest  ( photo ).

## Tabor and Cyrus +

- In November 2018, Adam Barnes,  the  former  technical  director of Ultra Varisys, and several of his colleagues visited the AmigaKit offices in Cardiff ( photo  ).  They  helped  Matthew  Leaman  and  his  team  prepare  the production  and  support  of  the Tabor and Cyrus + motherboards .
- In anticipation of this work visit, Ultra Varisys shipped six pallets containing a mix of Cyrus + motherboards and Cyrus + and Tabor prototypes.
- The meeting lasted five days and was entirely dedicated to AmigaOne hardware, including production  issues  and  other  technical issues    :  motherboard  diagnos-

tics,  test  bench setup, fault finding procedures, overview of prepared internal documentation by Ultra Varisys, advice and assistance on production issues.

- To facilitate this transfer of technology between the two companies, AmigaKit suspended its commercial activities in order to focus on work on the Tabor and Cyrus  +  cards.  To  make  up  for lost  time,  the  AmigaKit  team worked nightly from 6:00 pm to 11:00 pm to serve and support its regular Amiga clientele.

## Software updates

- In  early  December  2018,  Andy Broad  and  Kevin  Sherratt  traveled to Cardiff to meet Matthew Leaman  during  a  long  development weekend. They worked on the next version (1.5) of Enhancer Software .
- Andy Broad has modified Multiviewer  to  use  Warp3D  (so  the power  of  the  graphics  card)  instead of Picasso96 to display the images.
- MultiEdit has also been updated and now has a restore option to retrieve  a  document  in  case  of power failure  or  system  failure when editing a document. Upon power  up  or  restart,  the  software provides the user with the ability to retrieve the document.
- AMIStore , which was migrated to a new server by Matthew Leaman in the summer of 2018, also received several updates.
- Casey  Cullen,  a  Linux  specialist, has released Fienix , a new Linux distribution based on Debian Sid, which  he  created  for  PowerPC machines.  Fienix  works  on  the AmigaOne X1000 and X5000.

## Dallas

- The beta version of Libre Office 5  for  AmigaOS  4  is  about  to  be completed ( photo ).
- A specific mechanism in version 4  of  Libre  Office  could  not  be fully implemented in AmigaOS 4. This  resulted  in  instability  and blockages  that  could  not  be  bypassed.
- Version 5 of Libre Office, which runs on Android, has a different mechanism  and  is  much  more portable , which allowed it to be implemented in AmigaOS 4.
- The Frieden brothers take  care of porting Libre Office on Amiga a week at a time, at best.

## Anecdote Commodore

- Trevor Dickinson spoke about a chapter written by Colin Proudfoot, former Deputy Director General  of  Commodore  UK,  in David Pleasance's book "Commodore:  The  Inside  Story".  Anecdote  is  about  their  partnership contract  with  the  Chelsea  FC team.  In  1987,  Commodore  UK was one of the first companies to sponsor a major English football team by paying the Commodore logo  on  the  Chelsea  FC  jersey  ( photo ).
- The sponsorship agreement continued until Commodore's bankruptcy in 1994, although in 1993 the  Commodore  logo  was  replaced  by  the  Amiga  logo.  According to Colin Proudfoot, "football  sponsorship  was  an  effective way to gain name recognition  and  brand  awareness,  the cost per minute, according to the media, was well worth it ."
- As part of the sponsorship deal, Commodore had to pay bonuses based on Chelsea's success each

season. But to mitigate Chelsea's "risk" of success, Commodore UK took  out  insurance  with  Lloyds of  London  .  And  as  Chelsae  FC went  into  the  quarter-finals  of the  League  Cup,  a  bonus  was paid by Commodore UK, the latter being covered by their insurance policy at Lloyds of London.

## Talos II

- Trevor Dickinson has purchased a  Talos  II  Secure  Workstation from Raptop Computing Systems ( pictured ). He is even the first acquirer in the world. This machine is based on two PowerPC POWER9 processors (18 cores each, or 144 threads), has 96 GB of DDR4 memory, PCIe 4.0 ports and a Radeon Pro WX7100 graphics card.
- The price of this workstation is eight to nine times higher than a complete AmigaOne X5000 . This  machine  is  very  heavy,  extremely  noisy  but  seems  to  be extremely well designed.

## Updates

Welcome to a whole new year, Amiga fans!  Is  it  any  better  than  the  last one?  Looking  at  the  world  at  large, perhaps  not  so  far,  and  for  some  I know it has been a near-literal kick in  the  teeth,  but  for  me  personally, aside from some snow, it's going OK for the moment. It's been somewhat interesting, at least.

I had a little bit of extra cash sitting in my PayPal account, so I ended up purchasing  some  new  Amiga  hardware on Ebay. I picked up the 'Terriblefire' TF328  expansion  for  the Amiga CD-32 game console, sold by Canadian Ebay user 'alenppc' (who sells them periodically on Ebay, and has one up now as of this writing.) Based on an open-source hardware project, the Terriblefire expands the CD-32 with 8 megs of RAM and an

IDE  interface  for  hard  drive  or  CF card,  along  with  more,  in  the  same vein as the SX-1 or SX-32 expansions, but easier and less expensive to obtain today. The version sold by Alenppc included 8 megs RAM, an IDE to CF adapter, an 8 gig CF card with OS and  lots  and  lots  of  Amiga  games included (the exact legality of which I  will not examine at this particular time),  and  a  riser  circuit  board  to connect  to  the  CD-32  main  board with interfaces of its own, created by my  frequent  grump-target  of  my Vampire accelerator stories, Kipper2K.

Initial  tests  and  impressions  have been good, and with a bit more testing I hope to bring the 'Terriblefiredup' system to the meeting for demo and  general  playing  around.  Compared to other expansions I've experienced that expand the CD-32 from 'game  console'  to  'Amiga  computer,' it's  largely  the  same,  though  the  8 MB RAM is on-board rather than on a  separate  memory  stick,  and  the only ports in back are for RGB video and  a  PS2  keyboard,  where  older commercial expansions offered most to all of the ports found on the back of any Amiga computer. It's possible  a  version  of  the  TF  riser  card with more  ports might be available-I don't know, but here the lack of an external floppy drive port is the big detriment, meaning that the only apparent way to get new files on the system is to burn them to CD-ROMs, or possibly pulling the CF card and plugging it into another system that can read it. Still, as an option to inexpensively expand the CD-32 console, it's an attractive option (only costing me approximately $120 shipped with all the stuff I mentioned above). It's  far  less  pricey than trying to acquire a vintage SX expansion today. In fact, if  Ebay listings are to be believed, I could conceivably make a lot of money selling off the CD-32 extras I  already  own,  like  the  SX-1  expansion, the Full Motion Video cartridge, and about three Competition Pro joypad  controllers.  They're  more  valuable than Beanie Babies!

With the new year, I have been changing and updating my own stuff here and there. I am now on Twitter, just like a president. I haven't tried it out yet,  but  there  is  even  an  unofficial Twitter client for Amiga systems, so I could use it pretty much anywhere besides a phone.

In other things I haven't tried yet, I downloaded the latest 'Amibian' distribution for my Raspberry Pi, which is  an  Amiga emulation setup. I may demonstrate  it  at  a  future  meeting, though this month's is unlikely. This is  another step in an ongoing quest of  mine.  I  have  my  veteran  Amiga 4000/060 tower, which has served me  for  well  over  a  decade  now. Knowing that the life of any computer  system  is  finite  in  one  sense  or another, I have been looking to find a newer replacement. The problem I run into, however, is that while the options I have tried have done well in their own way, surpassing the classic system in some ways, I keep finding things, whether software or hardware-related  demands,  which bring me back to the 4000.

To give examples, while my G5 Mac running  MorphOS  wipes  the  floor with  my  Amiga  for  speed,  storage, memory    and  modern  OS  conventions,  it  only  runs  its  own  software and  'well-behaved'  Amiga  software, which means some of the software I'd  like  to  work  with  ranges  from 'quirky' to 'unusable', and metalbanging software such as old games are out of the question. My Vampirecarded Amiga 600 performs well, if not as heavy on the horsepower as the G5, but I'm waiting on core revisions  to  improve  convenience,  add the AGA chipset emulation, and still some software I want doesn't work properly.    So  that  sends  me  to  the emulation  option.  Perhaps  emulating an Amiga using a full-fledged PC would be a better option than a Raspberry  Pi,  but  considering  I  can  purchase a complete Pi system for about fifty bucks give or take, the economics are on its side.

Many turn to emulation in order to play  classic  games  more  than  running  productivity  software,  but  I'm looking to explore the top end, and how it can surpass the real hardware the  way  a  Vampire  or  PPC  Amiga might. There are a number of factors I'm  looking  to  explore  through  the various hardware and software solutions  I've  accumulated.  One  is  the aforementioned economic factor. Classic Amiga hardware of all kinds are getting pricier as the retro community  grows  and  working  examples get scarcer. Another is obviously speed, storage, and other specifications. Even modest computers and phones far exceed the wildest  dreams  of  an  Amiga  user  from 1994.  While  I  don't  need  an  Amiga stacking  terabytes  upon  gigahertz, it's  nice  to  meet  and  hopefully  exceed the power of a 50 Mhz 68060based  system.  While  compatibility with old-as-dirt software and those games and other programs that address  hardware  directly  is  not  a deal-breaker, it would be quite helpful to me where possible, and a distinct reason I hold on to older systems. Finally, it would be good to make use of the newer standards, or at least not be left behind. It would be  nice  to  connect  to  a  flat-screen monitor via HDMI, use USB devices and  storage,  and  make  use  of  the internet at least a bit from the Amiga side  of  things.  Each  of  my  options can  do  some  but  not  all  of  these things, so I keep them all around to do  whatever  aspect  I  want  at  the moment.  When  I  figure  things  out enough  that  one  solution  becomes the solution to all (or nearly all) of the problems, I shall become invincible,  at  least  from  an  Amiga  standpoint.
