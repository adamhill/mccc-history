Well, it's been one of those months, hasn't  it?  Our  home  town  became the  setting  of  a  mass  shooting,  in Dayton's  Oregon  district,  proving without doubt that, wherever you are, if you say 'That can't ever happen  here',  you're  wrong.  People and pundits like looking for a single

taneously  the  best  and  the  worst invention  in  recent  memory.  It  allows  anyone  in  the  world  to  communicate with anyone, access information  (and  files),  and  build an audience for what they have to say.  However,  like  any  useful  tool (or weapon), the Internet is not inherently good or evil, but the individual(s)  who  use  it,  and  the thing  to  blame, whether guns or the  Internet  or mental health or politics or race relations or video  game  violence.  It  seems apparent  to  me there's more than  one  cause for any single incident,  and  definitely more than  one  for  all the incidents we've been forced to deal with  in  this  na-

ly  easy  for  someone  to  seek  out stuff  that  fits  in  with  their  world view and ignore anything that challenges  it.  I'm  sure  if  there's  someone out there espousing the position  that  all  global  and  local governments are conspiring to cover  up  the  fact  that  the  oceans  are actually full of nothing but Diet Dr. Pepper,  there  is  probably  a  mes-

Johnny Kitchens will be donating 2 Raspberry Pi Computers to be given away at the September 14 meeting. We will give away a Raspberry Pi 4 B and a Raspberry Pi 3 B. They will both have cases, power supplies and have micro SD cards with Raspbian OS on them.

The give-away is open to members only. New memberships and membership renewals will be accepted  prior  to  the  give-away. Members will be allowed one free entry, and can buy extra tries for a $1 each. Members must be present to win. Only one win per person.

It's not my job as a computer group guy  to  be  a  pundit  and  shove  my opinions in everyone's face, regardless of how tempting and easy it is for me (or anyone, really) to do so. Instead, I'll vent a bit about one of those things that wind up being a factor  in  a  lot  of  this  stuff  -the Internet. I'm of the opinion that the Internet and social media is simul-

When this social media  power  is harnessed by an unscrupulous manipulator,  or when those with the  most extreme viewpoints turn words into actions,  the  Internet tool becomes more dangerous. It uses they put it to, could be. Someone could use social media as a medium to spread awareness and help others or correct injustices in a venue where other forms of communication  can't  be  relied  upon,  but someone else might use the same tools to spread hatred, conspiracies, or false information that is widely believed  because  it's  stated  with authority.  Unlike  earlier  forms  of communication and media, the Internet makes it easy, perhaps TOO easy for anyone with a specific belief or message to find an audience that wants to hear it, and converse-

doesn't  help  when  truth  and  lies and jokes and satire can look like the  same  thing  depending  on  the viewer,  which  can  make  you  long for  the  pre-2000  days  when  'the Internet' was something  where nerds  argued  about  whether  Kirk was better than Picard while making fun of the AOL noobs.

It's hard to say what exactly can be done  about  all  this.  Dangerous  Internet discourse can be controlled or moderated to an extent, but on one side those determined enough will just find an un-moderated ven-

Like pretty much every major political issue, the Internet is a big complex  mess  with  no  easy  answers, with plenty of people offering their answers despite a lack of sufficient

Sorry for the downer  write-up and lackluster philosophy. Sometimes  it's  harder to  avoid  an  opinion piece than usual, and having crap  go  down  in your  home  town is  one way to stir things up internally.

On  the  upside,  I recently got a new pup  that I  have named Duke.
