## Hobbies and Entertainment

We're already a month into the year 2019,  and  I  can't  speak  for  everyone, but the year has been treating me OK so far. Perhaps things will be good  for  our  president  too  (club, not nation) now that the lunar new year has started.

The  threat  of  bad  weather  caused us  to  cancel  last  month's  meeting. On  hindsight,  perhaps  we  could have  swung  it,  but  better  to  stay safe than risk getting snowed in. At least  we  have  a  few  bits  of  Amiga news to keep us going.

The new A-EON Personal Paint software has an update coming for Amiga OS3 and OS4, with a few additions and bug fixes. Time will tell  if  it  turns  out  actually  useful and  not  a  dumpster  fire  like  the previous version.

The Checkmate 1500 computer case is approaching its production goal. The case is modeled after the look of the Amiga 3000, and can fit a  wide  range  of  system  boards, from certain classic Amigas to PPC system main boards to mini/micro ATX PCs to Raspberry Pi. For more info, check out:

I have a number of things in my life that I consider hobbies and things I consider entertainment, which has caused  me  to  think  occasionally

## MCCC News 0

## March 2019

about  what  exactly  constitutes  a hobby, as my activities tend to be more of a range or spectrum not so easily  broken  up  into  segments, sometimes involving the same materials.  The  drawing  and  graphics work I do for the purpose of making a living I can't really call a hobby, despite being things I may have done as a hobby in the past, sometimes quite literally. Consider it 'living  the  dream'  to  do  work  you enjoy  as  your  job,  I  guess,  though making  a  job  of  it  does  kind  of change the dynamic.

On the other end of the range, consuming  media  and  entertainment doesn't qualify either to me, as they are mostly fleeting experiences that  don't  necessarily  stick  with you. For example, watching a movie on DVD or Blu-Ray is not a hobby, but collecting favorite films on disc could be. To me, a hobby is something  you  do  primarily  for  your own  enjoyment  and  enrichment, something that requires effort and work (and probably money, but not always) to achieve, more than just pressing a button or hitting 'buy' on Amazon.

So what are my hobbies? (and how do they relate to an Amiga club, if at all?)  I've  always  enjoyed  drawing and  creating  artwork  and  animation  for  as  long  as  I've  been  able. That has shifted more  into  the realm of work nowadays, as previously stated, and I find it more difficult to do more of that 'on my own time,'  but  on  rare  occasion  I  still manage.  Public  examples  include the  three  Amiga  animated  shorts

built  around  songs,  which  can  be found on YouTube, which were created not as part of a job, nor with any real intent to make money off them, even though each took from months to years to produce.

I  collect  toys,  which  I  consider  on the edge of hobby status, some acquisitions  requiring  greater  work than others.

On occasion I've been known to collect Amiga-related hardware or software  as  well,  Without  exactly intending  to,  I've  acquired  examples  of  nearly  every  major  Amiga model,  and  have  toyed  with  the idea  of  trying  to  complete  the  set. As Amiga hardware gets rarer and commands higher prices over time, that  prospect  becomes  less  attractive, and it doesn't feel worth dropping a big sum just to own a CDTV that I doubt I'd get much use out of.

I  think  some  of  my  other  Amiga hardware pursuits, like building up a Vampire system or a decked-out CD-32 falls into hobbyist territory, at least until the systems pull their own weight more for work or entertainment.  Finally,  I  keep  playing around with Lightwave 3D on my MorphOS system (running the classic  V5  Amiga  software).  I  find  myself building 3D models of spacecraft of my own design in the style  of  various  Star  Trek  series, among  other  things.  This  is  done for  a  work-related  purpose,  but  it feels more like a hobby to me, largely because I find working on them fun  and  diverting,  and  I  put  more work  into  them  than  I  might  if  it was 'just a job.' It reminds me in a way  of  my  childhood  hobby  of building  plastic  models  of  aircraft and such. It  brings  out  a  different set of skills than I normally use, and it's a slower, more methodical way of  working,  almost  Zen  at  times.  I suppose the status technically shifts again when I use the models I create in a project, but I can figure out where to go from there.

## Killing Net Neutrality

-

## None of the Supposed Benefits are Real

Network  investment  is  down,  layoffs abound, and networks are falling  apart.  This  isn't  the  glorious future Ajit Pai promised.

In the months leading up to the FCC assault  on  net  neutrality,  big  telecom and FCC boss Ajit Pai told anybody  who'd  listen  that  killing net neutrality would boost broadband industry investment,  spark  job  creation,  and drive  broadband  into  underserved  areas  at  an  unprece- dented rate.

they'd  also  be  seeing  lower  network investment numbers in 2018. It's  not  expected to get any better in 2019.

According to analysis this week by Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson,  capital  spending  among the nation's four biggest cable providers (Altice, Comcast, Charter Spectrum,  CableONE)  is  expected to  decline  upwards  of  5.8  percent this year.

Phone companies (AT&amp;T, Verizon) are similarly expected to see their wireline  capex  fall  from  $20.3  billion  in  2018  to  $19.6  billion  this year, notes the firm. And while investment in wireless is expected to jump slightly thanks to fifth generation (5G) investment, there too analysts have noted that overall investment  is  notably  more  sluggish than many had predicted.

The  FCC  did  not  respond  to  a  request for comment on why its predictions  have  been  so  decidedly inaccurate.

Meanwhile, none of this comes as much  of  a  surprise  to  those  well versed in the net neutrality fight.

'The repeal of net neutrality will go down in history as one of the most blatant  examples of corruption in our nation's history.'

As  it  turns  out,  none  of  those promises were actually true.

Despite  the  FCC  voting  to  kill  the popular consumer protections late last year, Comcast's latest earnings report  indicates  that  the  cable  giant's capital expenditures (CAPEX) for 2018 actually decreased 3 percent.  The  revelation  comes on the heels by similar statements by Verizon and Charter  Spectrum  that

While  the  FCC  and  telecom  sector repeatedly  tried  to  claim  that  net neutrality rules stifled network In vestment,  SEC  filings,  earnings  reports,  and  even  dozens  of  public statements made by countless CEOs easily disproved those claims. That  didn't  stop  either  Pai  or  the telecom sector from repeating the claims countless times over a twoyear span.

Gigi Sohn, a former FCC lawyer who helped  craft  the  agency's  net  neutrality rules, told Motherboard that the repeal of net neutrality (and the Title  II  classification  of  ISPs  that legally underpinned the protections)  was  based  on  little  more than fluff and nonsense.

'The  cornerstone  of  Ajit  Pai's  net neutrality repeal order has quickly crumbled,' Sohn told me in an email.

'The  broadband  industry's  reduction  in  investment  and  CAPEX  in the wake of Ajit Pai's repeal of the net  neutrality  rules  proves  what advocates  for  Internet  openness have known all along-neither the rules nor Title II authority had any effect on broadband investment.'

Sohn  told  me  telecom  investment decisions are based on a wide variety of factors including technological advancement, the economy, and the level of competition an ISP sees in its market. Given huge swaths of America only have the choice of one ISP  to  choose  from,  there's  little pressuring  them  to  put  soaring profits  back  into  the  network  or customer service.

And  that's  the  problem.  Net neutrality violations and other bad  behaviors  by  big  telecom are just a symptom of a lack of vibrant  competition.  But  the Pai FCC has routinely worked to downplay this even  to  the  point  of  trying  to problem, weaken the very definition of the  word  'competition'  to  the  exclusive benefit of entrenched ISPs.

Instead,  the  focus  for  the  Trump administration has been to dole out billions  in  tax  cuts,  subsidies,  and regulatory favors to giant telecom operators,  who  in  turn  routinely promise  job  growth,  network  investment,  and  better  service  that never actually materializes.

Motherboard  has exclusively reported  how  AT&amp;T  is  prepping  another major round of layoffs despite  netting  nearly  $20  billion from the Trump tax cuts. And Verizon this week said it would be cutting 7 Percent of its media staff-on the heels of a 10,000 employee 'voluntary' severance package-despite  its  own  mammoth windfall of government favors.

Other ISPs, like Frontier Communications,  have  been  literally  letting their  networks  fall  apart  in  many states, despite millions in taxpayer subsidies and repeated allegations of  fraud.  These  are  problems  that were never going  to  be  solved  by killing  popular  consumer  protections.

Evan  Greer, Deputy  Director of Fight  For  the  Future,  told  Motherboard.

The repeal of net neutrality 'will go down in history as one of the most blatant  examples  of  corruption  in our nation's history,' Greer said. 'It's  not  helping  workers  at  these companies. It's not helping people in  rural  communities. It's not closing the digital divide,' Greer added. 'The repeal of net neutrality is nothing but a massive government handout  to  some  of  the  most  unscrupulous, and least popular, corporations in the United States.'

every  indication  that  a  looming backlash  could  spoil  the  sector's fun  as  the  pendulum  inevitably swings back the other direction.

Next month sees the opening arguments in a lawsuit against the FCC over its net neutrality repeal, where  the  agency's  false  claims (not to mention  its decision  to make up a DDOS and turn a blind eye to fraud during the public comment period) will take center stage.

And while big telecom has been understandably  thrilled  at  its  good fortune  in  the  Trump  era,  there's

While this kind of pay to play dysfunction is widespread in telecom,  the  assault  on net neutrality was among the most obvious  examples  of  government kowtowing to natural monopolies, say consumer groups.

'Dismantling the basic principle that prevents  companies  like Comcast and Verizon from controlling what we see and do online helps  no  one  other than telecom lobbyists and executives,'

If the FCC loses that case, there's a good  chance  that  the  FCC's  2015 net  neutrality  rules  could  be  restored. And even if the FCC and its telecom sector allies win, they still have to find a way to prevent lawmakers from passing a real net neu-
