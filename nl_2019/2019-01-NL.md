## Uncertainty

In  my  quest  to  find  interesting  Amigarelated media, I can now point you to the '10 Minute Amiga Retro Cast.' Here are a couple worthwhile sample episodes, with more to be found if you check out and subscribe to the channel.

Life  is  full  of  uncertainty,  but  I'm  not particularly used to having a lot of uncertainty in the Amiga world. For me, either things  work  the  same  way  they  always have for years if not decades, or it was something  totally  unavailable  that  you needed  a  different  system  for.  That's been changing recently, and it was in a way called to my attention by Mike, our Prez. He was asking me questions about 'Coffin', formerly 'Apollo OS' (apolloos.weebly.com), basically a ready-made 'distro' based on Amiga OS 3.9  for  Vampire  card-based  Amiga  systems, containing a good amount of included  software.  He  was  asking  about  the legal  status  of  included  software,  and without  looking  deeper,  I  had  no  idea, especially the 3.9 workbench, which has been  its  own  dead-end  as  current  owners  and  developers  of  Amiga  OS  don't have legal access to Haage and Partner's work. Then there's the new 3.1.4 version of  'classic'  Amiga  OS from Hyperion, an online distribution of Amiga workbench software  (ADF  disk  images)  and  a  software ROM update. (at least until actual chips  get  made)  I've  heard  varying  stories  regarding  the  ease  of  installation, and the feasibility of installing over top of  a  previous  version.  While  there  are several  new  features  available  (such  as the option to move display windows off the edges of the screen, if that is important to you), many features come off as re-implementing  features  from  the  3.53.9 era of OS development. It also feels a

little  bit  like  Hyperion  attempting  to bring  in  classic  68k  Amiga  users  as  a potential  captive  audience  and  revenue stream, though that may just be cynicism on my part.

What  I  don't  know  is  how  this  new  OS variation  would  work  on  my  old  hardware, or on my Vampire system, which both  happily  run  3.9  currently,  hence that  uncertainty.  I  don't  know  whether it's worth the money, time, and effort for a  gain  that  may  be  more  of  a  side-step than  a  leap  forward  relative  to  my  old 3.9-based systems. Perhaps that decision will  be  easier  when  and  if  the  3.1.4  OS fork advances further, and offers a clearer advantage.

A major source of Amiga uncertainty in my  life  comes  from  my  Vampire  A600 system. I originally pursued and bought the  Vampire  board  (and  may  yet  get  a standalone  Vampire  system  in  the  future)  with  an  eye  toward  replacing  my aging  Amiga  4000/060 with something more  compact  yet  also  more  capable, though the 'more capable' part depends largely on what you intend to get out of it. My A4000 does a number of things, but its primary job is the stuff that my MorphOS systems don't handle, such as Amiga games, scanning with my old SCSI HP scanner,  and  painting  using  Personal Paint. While the V600 is capable of playing  Amiga  games  just  fine  with  WHDLoad  (about  as  well  as  the  A4000  at least) it plays AGA games the 600 can't, at  least  not  until  the  AGA  implementation  in  the  Vampire  board  reaches  beyond the beta stage. Hopefully this would also  help  the  other  shortcoming  of  the Vampire 600: different video types come from  different  outputs  (Amiga  RGB  or HDMI),  and  thus  require  a  switchbox, converter  or  extra  monitor  to  see  it  all, adding input lag depending on the setup, which doesn't help you play a game. An update that directs all Amiga video modes out the HDMI cable can fix much of that.

The SCSI scanner is more my own problem,  as  the  V600  (and  most  modern things) doesn't use SCSI. That scanner is aging  and  temperamental  anyway,  yet still  the  best  I  have  available.  USB  scanners are another option, but it's not easy to find one that works well with an Amiga or Morph system, much less a scanner with  the  nice  big  legal  page  size  of  my SCSI one.

The final listed issue is the one I've been trying  (yet  failing)  to  correct.  I  use  Personal Paint (7.1) on my A4000, but when the software is run on a MorphOS or Vampire  system,  there  are  problems.  I've gone over this in previous months, and how  I  bought  Aeon's  newer  Personal Paint  7.3  to  hopefully  address  these  issues, and it…did, and didn't. One of the big issues I had was fixed, and drawing filled freehand or polygonal shapes works correctly now. However, other issues are not yet addressed, such as the freakish behavior when trying to modify palette colors using the HSV  sliders (seems like a strange math discrepancy between the old processors and PPC/Vampire).  There  is  some  misalignment between the mouse pointer and the point actually affected on the screen. (I'm willing to chalk this up to MorphOS rather  than  PPaint)  Also,  there  have  been occasional  problems  with  the  program freezing and maxing out all CPU resources, at least on MorphOS, after saving a file (only occasionally), or typing 'S' to get a full view of a page larger than the screen (every time). I haven't confirmed which if any of these two bugs carry over to the Vampire yet, but I did find a doozie of an interface glitch, in which apparently the even-numbered options of certain things are apparently unavailable to pick, whether they be colors in the palette, or color depth when picking a screen mode. (skipping from 2 to 8 to 32 to 128 to 512, which isn't technically possible for PPaint.) Sadly, most of these bugs make Personal Paint, either the old or new version,  somewhere  between  difficult  and unusable  on  my  MorphOS  or  Vampire systems  currently.  I  suppose  I  should send in some bug reports.

I  suppose I  should also try running the new 7.3 version on my original Amiga, as that's  what  the  program  is  technically meant for, but here is where the uncertainty monster rears its head again. While the new version has new features over the classic 7.1 version, there's not that  many,  especially  not  in  the  areas  I actually  use.  There's  no  point  in  replacing  the  old  version  if  there's  even  a chance  of  running  into  any  of  the  bugs introduced  that  I've  seen  on  the  other systems, when what I have now is working fine. Still, in the interests of curiosity and fair play, I probably should set up a temporary installation at least for testing purposes when I get the time. I suppose if I never get a version of Personal Paint working bug-free on my newer systems, I  can  hope  for  updates  in  the  Vampire core making it easier to get more life out of even older paint software, such as Brilliance or even Deluxe Paint.

## Bad Reviews &amp; My Wish List

In my patrols of Youtube, I occasionally find new Amiga-related content to share. In perhaps the most high-profile recent appearance, the 'Angry Video  Game Nerd,' basically THE pioneer of the 'comedic game reviews as entertainment' genre, finally reviewed the Amiga CD-32 game  console,  covering  several  lackluster games in one video and one specifically  bad  CD-32  game  (actually  a  CDTV game),  'Town  With  No  Name'  in  a  second.  I'll  admit  to  getting  a  bit  miffed watching  the  videos,  and  having  some 'outsider' bash my platform from a point of relative ignorance, (it doesn't help that his  particular  console  had  a  European power  supply  and  needed  the  CD  lid weighed down to stay closed), wanting to defend it, even knowing that these 'reviews' are played up and exaggerated for the  sake  of  comedy.  Still,  the  emotions flare  up  just  the  same,  in  that  'Nobody beats  up  on  my  system  but  ME!'  kinda way, especially when the CD-32 is apparently destroyed at the end of the second video. I'll  have to badger Mr. Rolfe (the 'Nerd's' alter-ego) to return to the system and play  some  of  the  legitimately  good games  available  for  it.  I'm  not  loaning any games or systems out though. There's too much risk of them getting hurt.

For a slightly nicer, or at least more informative Amiga-related video, I found the 'Ahoy'  channel,  which  covers  computer and game history subjects, and their recent video on the Amiga, specifically the system's history from the launch of the Amiga  1000  to  the  later  appearance  of the  A500  and  A2000  models,  a  time  of turmoil for Commodore and the Amiga. I learned a few things I didn't know before watching this video, so if you're an Amiga history buff, you might want to give it a look: https://youtu.be/zB\_Uzsjubwq

Being the Christmas season and all, I enjoy taking this opportunity to express my 'wish list' of things I'd like to see for the coming year, if not the holiday itself.

From the Apollo and Vampire people, I'd like  to  see  a  ready-for-prime-time  version of their core which includes the AGA chipset and allows all video and audio to be  directed  out  the  HDMI  interface.  I'd also like to see the new 'V4' boards, in stand-alone  and  add-on  card  versions.

While  there  has  been  no  talk  of  one,  I think it would be neat to see a Vampire card for the CD-32 console, which works similar to the older SX-1 or SX-32 expansions, turning the console into a full computer with all necessary ports and interfaces,  except  with  Vampire  power and modern interfaces (such as HDMI for video out.)

From Aeon, I'd like to see an update to their version of Personal Paint that isn't a buggy piece of crap. I've tried out the software  on  MorphOS,  Vampire-Amiga, and 68060-Amiga, and all have bugs that either carried over from the old Cloanto release or added anew. When a new release  has  more  bugs  than  the  old,  and doesn't add the features to justify it, it's not a worthwhile release. I can only hope the  separate  OS4  version  has  fewer  issues.

As usual, I wish for some of the 'big boys' of  past  Amiga  software  to  release  their work,  either  to  open-source  development  or  to  another  developer,  though right  now  it  seems  like  AEON  is  one  of the  only  ones  picking  up  on  older  software, and based on Personal Paint and other  stuff,  their  track  record  doesn't look too good to me. Many of these probably  would  never  be  open-sourced,  as they may still live on other platforms, but I'd still like to see the likes of Lightwave 5, or Photogenics 5, or Moviesetter, or a hundred  other  pieces  of  productivity software  brought  up  to  modern  standards, and able to take advantage of the power  of  the  newer  systems,  whether Vampire or PPC-based or accelerated emulation. Finally, I hope you all, and me too, have  a  good  year  in  2019,  or  at  least better than some of the crap I've had to put up with.
