## The Amiga Development System

Johnny Kitchens sent me a link to an article about 'The Amiga Before the Amiga.' I'd love to include it here, but because of the numerous photos in the article it isn't really a good fit for print. I do highly recommend it.

What follows is from the introductory section of the article:

'The  original  Amiga  computer was  launched  to  the  public  on July  23,  1985,  in  a  legendary demonstration at Lincoln Center in  New York featuring the likes of Andy Warhol and Debbie Harry.

Prior to that epic event, however, there was another  Amiga-a lesser-known member  of the family  most  have  never  even heard  of.  Back  in  1984/1985 Commodore created a few hundred 'Development Edition' machines called the Amiga Development System. Sometimes, due to a very unique early design, they are also sometimes referred  to  as  'Velvet'  which was  a name  for  a particular motherboard layout some had.

Commodore sent these computers  to  companies  around  the world  in  the  hopes  they  would decide  to  support  the  new  platform in the form of creating software and tools.

May 2019

Thus, the Development System is a  very  unique  machine  most  of which  have  been  lost to  the sands of time. Prior to this writing  it  was  believed  that  only  5 Development Systems remained around the world.

Assuming  that's  true,  there  are now six.

I now have in my possession one of the rarest Amigas ever made-one that was never sold to  the  consumer  market.  And this  one  appears  to  be  entirely unique from its brethren, which I shall soon explain.'

## The Amiga Doesn't Get The Respect It Deserves

One  of  the  things  that's  nice  about the internet is that, while the Amiga may play historic market second fiddle to the Windows PC or Mac, there still continues to be content covering the platform to this day, from videos to podcasts and more. My 'link of the month'  this  time  is  the  Arcade  Attack retro gaming podcast from the UK.

Listening to podcasts like these are partly interesting, partly infuriating… listening to these people sharing  their  fond  memories  for  the Amiga from the perspective of young (at the time) gamers, and somewhat

butchering their information on Amiga hardware and history.

In my bit of old man ranting for the month, I've been thinking a bit about how the Amiga is remembered today, especially among those who may not have  directly  experienced  the  platform, due to either being too young or users of other systems back in the day. Of course, enthusiasts of 'retro' systems,  games,  and  software  are quite  common  today,  with  some even being too young for first-hand knowledge  of  whatever  they're  collecting  or  emulating.  Part  of  this  is probably thanks to 'retro' media attention on YouTube and other internet  venues  showing  off  the  good (and not so good) stuff from the past.

Still, when people, especially newer people, get into retro stuff, they do it from the viewpoint of someone without  much historical  perspective.  As we know, history  is  written  by  the victors. As we all know, (depending on who you ask) Windows 95 invented multitasking and Apple invented smartphones  and  the  GUI.  It's  only those nutty conspiracy theorists that would deny that, right? Sometimes I wonder if  this  is  why  Atari  doesn't have quite the retro clout of Nintendo or Sega nowadays, despite being the  first  game  console  to  hit  it  big. Either that, or the limited 1977 hardware of the Atari VCS restricted the complexity and variety of games that the  later  game  systems  would  be known  for,  and  retro  enthusiasts may  prefer  a  certain  level  of  play over the older and simpler fare.

I  tend  to  get  more  annoyed  when people look at older games without proper  perspective  for  the  time  in which they were made, or worse, an ignorant  and  incorrectly  confident sense  of  wrong  perspective.  An  example  is  when  people  like  to  toss around  ideas  like  Atari's  2600  version  of  Pac-Man,  and/or  the  E.T. Game  caused  the  American  video game  crash  of  1983/4,  when  they were  little  more  than  convenient missteps  to  point  to  in  a  swirling mass  of  market  forces.  Another  is saying Atari Pac-Man was a poor representation of the arcade original be- cause  the  console was  incapable  of doing better, when later efforts by homebrew games makers and Atari themselves  prove  the 2600 can do a perfectly  serviceable Pac-Man game given the right effort.

seen  to  balk  at  Amiga  games  with their single-button joysticks,  and their 'European' feel. Throwing around those misconceptions, many write off the Amiga CD-32 as a terrible,  failed  game  console,  and  their not  entirely  wrong,  as  it  failed  to turn Commodore's fortunes around enough to prevent bankruptcy. They're  not  entirely  right  either,  as for its short life the CD-32 was a top seller  in  the  UK,  and  definitely  outperformed  Commodore's  previous attempts to  turn  computer  hardware  into  home  and  game  systems, such  as  the  C64-GS  and  the  CDTV. That  doesn't  prevent  a  lot  of  US-

A first consumer system to offer a multitasking OS AND multimedia capabilities AND graphic acceleration at a time when most other computers were lucky if they could put more than 8 colors on the screen at once.

I  guess  what  I'm saying is there's a lot of ignorance out  there  regarding  past  computers and game systems, borne out of propagated based YouTube game channels from  dumping  on it however.

It birthed several franchises  that  outlived  it  in games and graphic software, like Lemmings and Worms, or Lightwave 3D and TV Paint.

misinformation and a lack of real experience.

Looking at various media on the Amiga, especially in retro-gaming circles, there seem to be two types of coverage. One type comes from Europeans, which  tends  to  be  more  fond  and nostalgic, and the other comes from Americans,  which  frequently  treat the  Amiga  more  as  a  curious  bit  of obscurity. These attitudes make sense  in  context,  as  the  Amiga  was never the big force in North America that it was in the UK and many other European countries. US gamers tend to  look  at  past  games  through  the lens of Nintendo and Sega and Japanese game creators, and have been

I have little choice but  to  live  with  it, as trying to explain the  merits  of  the Amiga era to someone who someone who  didn't  experience them just makes you look like  the  crank  living  in  the  past.  I can even understand to an extent, as it's not unlike a hardcore basketball fan covering a baseball game, or a scholar covering 1940's  swing  music  asked  to  give opinions on death metal. Still, I know how ahead of its time the Amiga was even if others might not, being a first consumer  system  to  offer  a  multitasking OS AND multimedia capabilities  AND  graphic  acceleration  at  a time  when  most  other  computers were  lucky  if  they  could  put  more than 8 colors on the screen at once. It pioneered the style-over-substance type of 'Who cares if it plays like  crap?  Look  at  those  graphics!' Games with releases like Shadow of the Beast and the Cinemaware games. It birthed several franchises that outlived it in games and graphic software, like Lemmings and Worms,

or Lightwave 3D and TV Paint. It provided templates for the modern approach to PC design, such as  a video/graphic and sound co-processors that can operate independently of  the  main  CPU  for  better  performance  all  around.  For  many  out there today, it's the most important computer system they might never have heard of.

## Badly  Behaving Tech Companies

Ever since Sony admitted installing root kits on CD buyers' computers in 2005, I've kept a sort of Tech Company Sh*t List. While Sony has finally been removed due to a 14-year hiatus, others live on in glorious ignominy. Here's my list:

## AT&amp;T

Way too much to list! This company has an over-hundred-year history of monopolistic practices and screwing over its customers in the pursuit of revenues.  Even  after  being  forcibly broken  up  by  the  government  in 1982 (it was THAT BAD!) their corporate  culture  is  seemingly  still  in the  1940's,  voraciously  abusing  its customers.

## Asus

The  Federal  Trade  Commission  put Asus on a 20-year sort of probation in  2016  because  their  routers  had numerous security vulnerabilities and Asus did not demonstrate much interest in addressing the flaws in a timely manner-even after being notified multiple times.

Recently,  Kaspersky  revealed  that Asus' Live Update utility for PCs was used to distribute malware to its customers. There  are  still  questions about  whether  the  malware  may have actually originated from inside Asus.

## BLU phones

Chinese Android phones were found to ship with malware/adwareright out of the box, according to security researchers.

## Belkin

This company thought so little of its customers  in  2003  that  it  installed adware in brand-new, out-of-the box routers. As users surfed the web, Belkin would inject ads into the customers' browsers right from their Belkin router  advertising  Belkin  services. An opt-out mechanism was included but many users felt that when they buy  a  router,  they  should  not  be forced  to  opt-out  of  advertising  to avoid interruptions when using the Internet.

## Comcast

Another AT&amp;T with dozens of examples of squeezing their customers to increase and sustain revenue levels. Their pricing is very opaque and few can figure out what they charge for most services. The truth is, Comcast will charge you as much as they possibly  can.  There's  no  such  thing  as one price for all. In early 2019, media  reports  surfaced  stating  that  instead of greeting more competition in  the  TV  market  with  better  value, Comcast would simply raise remaining customers' TV prices to make up for the revenues lost to cord-cutting.

While  they  are  raking  their  customers over the coals, Comcast apparently  could  not  care  less  about  what those  same  customers  think  about them.  Comcast  has  been  voted  by various consumer  groups as the worst company in America multiple times. Many feel since they enjoy monopoly-like status in most communities, they don't feel the need to keep satisfaction scores high.

In  2010  many  Comcast  customers noticed  that  they  were  unable  to stream Netflix in high definition. The company  blamed  the  problem  on payment  disputes  among  carriers but some customers noted that the problem cleared right up when using

Netflix/Comcast  over  a  VPN  hiding the  traffic.  This  evidence  supports many customers' suspicions that Comcast was purposefully throttling the  Netflix  traffic  since  it  competes with  Comcast's  TV  product.  This case  comes  up  often  with  proponents  of  net-neutrality  as  an  example of unfair behavior by ISPs.

On  the  other  hand,  Comcast's  highspeed  Internet  product  in  Central Illinois is far superior to what most people  can  get  and  many  are  still forced to give this sh*t-hole company  their  money.  Luckily  there  are competing services on the horizon in the C-U area.

## D-Link

In  2017 the FTC stated that D-Link, "Consistently  failed  to  take  reasonable steps to protect its routers and internet-linked security cameras from  hackers."  As  of  this  writing, FTC lawsuits against D-Link are still ongoing.

## Hewlett-Packard Printers

In 2010 HP settled a lawsuit alleging that some HP printers either reported low ink or simply refused to print even  when  plenty  of  ink  was  still available, forcing consumers to spend  money  on  ink  replacements they really did not need.

In 2017 many reports surfaced that HP had launched a DRM time bomb-a software update designed specifically to disable competing printer  cartridges  starting  on  a  set date. As a result, HP Printer owners using third-party cartridges woke up one  day  to  warnings  about  a  "cartridge  problem,"  or  errors  stating, "one or more cartridges are missing or  damaged,"  or  that  the  user  was using an "older generation cartridge." It's  not  legal  to  prohibit  competing brands'  ink  cartridges  but  HP  sure does plenty to discourage this.

## Lenovo

Many  PC  companies  are  criticized for  including  unwanted  bloatware on customer machines. In 2014 Len- ovo  machines  shipped  with  actual adware. Masquerading as a piece of typical  manufacturer  bloatware,  Superfish Visual Discovery was a browser extension that analyzed images, checked if they were products, and  then  injected  ads  into  the  customers' browsers. To make matters worse,  Superfish  was  uninstallable, terribly insecure, and allowed hackers to monitor encrypted web browsing.

For  20  years,  Lenovo  will  be  required to put in place a "comprehensive  software  security  program  for most consumer software preloaded on its laptop," subject to external audits, the FTC said.

## Linksys

Now owned by Belkin (see above).

## Microsoft

Many despise Microsoft's monopoly tactics  used  during  the  1980s  and 1990s and those practices  are  well documented. As a result, some people  to  this  day  refuse  to  use  ANY Microsoft products.

If  you  believe  the  company's  new leadership  has  turned  the  corner and is now less evil all you have to do is  look  at  the  strong-armed  tactics the  company  used  to  force  its  Windows 10 software onto users of Windows 7 and 8.

When Windows 10 was released in 2015, Microsoft was aggressive about getting devices to upgrade. In some instances, it pushed several gigabytes  of  upgrade  files  to  customers without their knowledge or consent. Consumer backlash caused the company to stop the practice, but two years later, Microsoft is still facing  legal  repercussions.  While  the company claims the tactics were in customers' best interests, the company's  forced  upgrades  turned  into  a PR mess for Microsoft.

Last year, three Florida men filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, stating that  the  company  "coerced"  them into  the  upgrade  which  resulted  in damaged  PCs,  as  well  as  lost  time and  money.  Some  customers  even complained that a red X option that appears in the Windows 10 update box  actually  initiates  an  upgrade, rather  than  dismissing  it  as  users would commonly expect.

Microsoft  has  since  backed  down from  some  of  its  more  aggressive tactics,  and  now  offers  customers options, including "upgrade now, schedule  a  time  to  upgrade,  or  decline the free offer for the new OS."

## Office Depot

Between  2009  and  2016  Office  Depot  tricked  customers  into  buying unneeded  tech  support  services  by offering  PC  scans  that  gave  fake  results, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Consumers paid up to $300 each for unnecessary services.

"Defendants bilked unsuspecting consumers out of tens of millions of dollars from their use of the PC Health Check program to sell costly diagnostic  and  repair  services,"  the  FTC  alleged  in  a  complaint  that  accuses both Office Depot and the company that supplied the software, Support.com,  of  violating  the  FTC Act's  prohibition  against  deceptive practices.

## Oracle

In 2015 Oracle agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it  deceived consumers about the security provided by updates to its Java Platform. According to the FTC's complaint,  since  acquiring  Java  in 2010,  Oracle  was  aware  of  signifi- cant  security  issues  affecting  older versions of Java SE. The security issues  allowed  hackers'  to  craft  malware  that could allow access to consumers' usernames and passwords for financial accounts, and allow hackers to acquire other sensitive personal information through phishing attacks.

Many  have  accused  Oracle  of  attempting to profit from its own software's insecurity by pushing customers  to  install  unwanted  software  such  as  third-party  toolbars during  the  update  process  necessitated  by  the  poor  security  of  older versions.

In 2015, Oracle's chief security office Mary Ann Davidson threatened security  researchers  with  vague  consequences  for  examining  Oracle  code for vulnerabilities.

## Turbo Tax/Intuit

The  2003  version  of  the  TurboTax software contained digital rights management that tracked whether it had  previously  been  installed  on  a computer by writing to sector 33 on the  hard  drive.  This  allowed  it  to track if it was on a computer previously, even through reinstalling the operating system. This also caused it to  conflict  with  some  boot  loaders that store data there, rendering those computers unbootable.

## Vizio

Vizio, a popular smart-TV brand, settled a lawsuit that accused it of using its  TVs  to  track  what  its  owners watched,  then  selling  that  informa-

At least one CUCUG member reported  that  their  recent-vintage  Vizio Bluray player fell  out  of  favor  with the  company and software updates were discontinued prematurely. Because disc copy-protection schemes are  constantly  being  updated,  this rendered  the  player  unusable  for newer movies.

I'll  just  add  my  own  personal  contempt for Comcast which centers on their  despicable  corporate  torpedoing  of  the  democratic  process  by packing  FCC  public  hearings  with ringers back in 2008 to choke off the public's ability to testify against them.
