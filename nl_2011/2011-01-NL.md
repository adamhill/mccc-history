## Common Misconceptions

It's  a  special  time  of  year  (again), whether you're in it for the deep spiritual meaning, or just enjoying the secular commercialism. Everyone seems to find their own meaning and reason  in  the  season.  For  me, Christmas is about appreciating my family and friends. Over the years it's become  more  about  giving  than receiving for me, as I've grown more into a family head role in maturity. That  doesn't  mean  I  don't  still appreciate a good toy at Christmas though. I can only hope you all find your  holidays  as  meaningful  and enjoyable this year. I hope to see you at the meeting. Just a reminder-we will be having our usual holiday party, with music and games (courtesy of a visiting Amiga CD-32), and a Yankee swap gift exchange. lf you wish to participate,  be  sure  to  bring  a wrapped gift (roughly $5-$10 value) to the meeting.

Over the last several months, I've written repeatedly about my Amiga 25 th  anniversary animation project. Most of you reading this probably saw it in its almost-complete form at the November meeting, but in any case, I'm very pleased to report the animation  was  completed  in  late November. It can be viewed here:

I hope you all enjoy it anywhere near as  much  as  I  enjoyed  creating  it. Whenever I do anything related to the Amiga anymore, I'm reminded of the system's place in this "victors write the history" world, along with the ignorance of the modern-day average computer user. This ignorance falls into several categories that I've seen:

These are the people who ask things like how well your Amiga or Pegasos or Mac or whatever plays whatever recent popular Windows game (or even  X-Box),  and  assumes  a Microsoft Word file is standard for everyone  the  world  over.  An unfortunate fact is this is probably closer to justified today than in the past,  as  most  desktop  or  laptop computers produced today share a similar general hardware structure, regardless  of  whether  it  runs  a Windows or Linux or Mac operating system.

In  most  cases  'retro'  means 'something you run an emulator to play with' here. While not exactly a false  statement,  it  is  incredibly oversimplified, as home computers have  gone  through  several generations and constant evolution. For  an  Amiga  user,  it's  often frustrating to see it lumped together with Commodore 64s, Atari 800s and Apple lls, when those 8-bit machines were not its contemporaries of the time. Even so, Amiga has its own 'modern' and 'retro' in the form of the Amiga-like operating systems that run on PPC or Intel processors, and those based on the original 68XXXseries,  with  emulation  potentially going either way, depending on how it is used.

Some show a naivete in belief that the superior system automatically wins, and things like management and marketing don't strongly affect those  results.  By  extension,  if  a system didn't 'win,' it must not have been very good, and whoever's on  top  must  be  best  by  default. There are a bunch of Betamax video tape fans waiting in the wings to refute that.

While most people don't literally believe this, they still act like they do, if only on a subconscious level. This results  in  comparisons  and judgements  of  systems  and  the works  created  with  them  done without taking time into account. I've seen 32-color and HAM Amiga graphics compared directly with 24bit color works. I've seen Amigamade music dismissed for having neither the audio quality of modern hardware nor the 'retro charm' of 8-bit  chiptunes.  It's  not  an uncommon  thing  though.  Many pioneering forces in technology or entertainment are viewed as tame or even lame after years of copying and surpassing the pioneers, especially by those  who  don't  recognize  the pioneers for what they are. I'm sure there are plenty of people who think 'Toy Story' had pretty crappy CGI compared to-say-'Toy Story 3' as well. On the bright side, this kind of assumption has worked in the Amiga's favor once or twice, like when people see a 3D animation

- Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter played back, and assume it's being rendered on the fly like in a game.

CCC

There may be truth to this one, except when some replace 'modern' with Windows PC without exception. In any case there's always someone out there to go 'People still use Amigas? This is 2010, not 1990. Stuff today has a zillion times more speed and storage and  RAM  and  everything  else.' Sometimes I liken it to something like a classic car. One could say, 'Why bother with that stupid Mustang? This is 2010, not 1970. Today's cars are far more safe and efficient, and have CD and MP3 players in the dashboard. You're just being stubborn for holding on to that dinosaur.' The response is that it's something they enjoy, and my answer would be much the same. It's fun to work with a favored machine, and even push it beyond its original intents. Different Amiga users have their own preferences and reasons. For me it's a mix of preference and familiarity, a feel that has never been matched, a standard that has not been met. I've been guilty of this prejudice myself at a time, when looking at the lengths some go to for their 8-bit Commodore and Atari systems. I was bemused  by  the  hardware  and software  tinkering  to  keep  these systems relevant to the modern world, wondering why they bothered and didn't  get  a  newer  system  instead, before realizing I was doing the same as any 'outsider' would to me and my Amiga preferences. It's easy to fall into the  same  trap  you've  seen  others plummet into sometimes.

As I finish my rants, I conclude this article by wishing you all a happy and festive holiday season, and a good new year. We shall see what 2011 has to bring. Something good and Amigarelated would be excellent.

## AmigaOne X1000 CPU

London, 21 December 2010 http://www.a-eon.com/

AmigaOne X1000 CPU revealed-the cake is no lie!

A-EON Technology is  pleased  to finally  reveal  the  identity  of  the mystery CPU powering the AmigaOne X1000. It's none other than the uber cool  PWRficient  PA6T  processor developed by fabless chip designer PA Semi. The PA6T-1682M is a high performance, low cost, cool running dual-core, 64-bit, 2 GHz Power CPU specifically designed for embedded military and industrial applications. PA Semi was acquired by Apple in 2008 and  all  indications  were  that  they purchased  the  company  for  its intellectual property and planned to

## January Calendar

January - Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter 7:30 PM - Main Grand Prairie Library 901 Conover Drive, Grand Prairie January - Board of Director's Meeting Approximately 9:15 PM - Location TBD No January Meetings

January 29 - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 AM

MCCC      4418 Sharpsburg Drive      Grand Prairie, Texas 75052 http://www.amigamccc.org shut down the PA Semi product line. However, following demand from military and industrial users, Apple agreed to continue supplying chips to pre-existing PA Semi customers for a limited  time  period.  Fortunately Varisys,  our  AmigaOne  X1000 hardware partner, had a long-standing relationship with PA Semi and we were able to secure a supply of PA6T CPUs  for  the  AmigaOne  X1000 project, making it the first and most probably the only desktop computer based on the unique PA Semi CPU technology as Apple have now closed down the PA Semi product line.

Following  intense  speculation  on several  Amiga  forums  over  the identity of the mystery CPU, Thom Holwerda, the Managing Editor of the OSNews website commented on AmigaWorld.net:

'I can assure you all, with 110% certainty,  that  the  X1000 will NOT carry a processor from PA Semi. If it turns out it does, I will eat my socks and post the video as proof.'

We  decided  to  give  Thom  an exclusive on revealing the identity of the  mystery  CPU  inside  the AmigaOne X1000. Rather than the usual staid press release and forcing Thom to eat his own socks we took pity on him and shipped him a special cake decorated with a pair of edible 'Boing Ball' socks with a note saying the cake was a gift from A-EON Technology.
