## Changing Technology

Before  I  kick  off  this  month's newsletter, I would like to mention that as I write this, it's just barely after  September  11 th ,  the  decade anniversary of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington DC. It's been a curious time, looking back from the perspective of hindsight and ten years of changes in the world and life in general. It's almost hard to believe it all happened so long ago. Best  wishes  to  those  who  lost someone  in  the  attacks,  or  the military  actions  that  followed. Hopefully  nothing  remotely  as terrible will happen again.

Back to the world of technology and computers. You frequently hear from various  sources  how  various technologies and gadgets are 'dead,' or soon will be. They don't even agree on exactly which gadgets are the dead ones. Most do seem to agree however that the central nexus - the thing that coldly murders a lot of other tech gadgets - is the 'smartphone,' along with its bigger brother, the tablet computer. It's not hard to see  why,  as  most  smartphones combine the function of cell-phones, music  and  media  players,  digital cameras, personal digital assistants, and  many  things  that  previously required a full-fledged computer or game console to achieve, all in  a package that fits in your hand. A small device, no matter how capable, isn't ideal for all tasks by design, so the  tablet  is  the  next  step  up, supposedly set to usurp the low-end 'netbook' computers - perhaps the higher-end laptop systems too, given a generation or two of advancement. People have predicted the death of the desktop computer for quite a while now, as each descending level of system, from laptop to tablet or netbook to handheld device, gains in power  and  capability.  Desktops haven't stood still either, however, and still commonly outperform more portable machines at a similar pricepoint. I know from experience that convenience has its value as well, and that's  what  portable  computing provides, even if my laptop might be slower or have less storage than a system rooted to a desk. Perhaps the desktop and big-box systems will become  the  exclusive  domain  of professionals or server applications. It's hard to say for sure, but I doubt the boxes will die out anytime soon, even if they aren't likely to be found in homes in the future.

The biggest changes come when a hot new gadget or technology comes along and is adopted to a point where it causes a 'paradigm shift,' changing the way the general public works or plays or whatever, often killing the tech of 'old thinking' in the process. To cite a recent example, Nintendo has pretty much dominated the field of  hand-held  gaming  since  they brought out the original Gameboy in the  late  eighties,  even  with  stern competition from Atari, Sega, Sony, and others over the years. Their most recent hand-held game system, the 3DS, is said to be losing ground in the field however, despite spiffy tech to view 3D imagery without the need for glasses. Let's assume the decline in  sales  is  not  from  splitting headaches  from  poorly  adjusted screens. So what does that leave? The smartphones.  Many  consumers, including children, began to realize their phones were playing games almost  as  well  as  any  Gameboy descendant, and did much more besides  (such  as  being  a  phone) without much more cost. Suddenly the 3DS didn't look like the musthave  technology  anymore,  and between the iPhones and Androids, ground is gained in the portable gaming  market.  Before  that, smartphones killed off the PDA, typified by the humble Palm Pilot. That was more an evolution than a murder however, for as much as companies like Apple tried to deny it, the smartphone was basically a PDA with a cellphone added.

The grand-daddy of all paradigm shifters (at least in the tech world over the last few decades) would be the Internet, which, over the 1990s, transformed home computers from devices that helped you do your work  and  play  your  games  to  a window to the world of near-infinite information, media, and (of course) pornography. Unfortunately, it also transformed most computers from devices that actually did something, to something that you farted around on for hours on end. Even so, it's quite the achievement, and changed the way pretty much everyone in the civilized world works and lives, to the point where people like me can barely recall how we got by before having use of the 'net, even though the majority of my life was spent without it, even though I probably got more actually done back then as well.

## Spontaneous Human Combustion

Terrifying, isn't it? To imagine that you could be sitting in your favorite easy chair, happily reading UNIX in a Nutshell, and then your body just COMBUSTS - spontaneously and you're a pile of ashes.

A coroner in Ireland ruled last week that's exactly what happened to Michael Faherty, 76, who burned to death last December while minding his own business and collecting his pension. In other words, this guy officially died from spontaneous combustion.

Except for the floor below and the ceiling  above  the  body,  the apartment  and  furnishings surrounding Faherty's body were left intact. The veteran coroner of 25 years couldn't find any other explanation besides spontaneous human combustion. If something external  had  caused  the  fire, wouldn't the rest of the house have gone up in flames as well?

It's frightening at first blush. But don't get too upset. Spontaneous human combustion is probably not real. Yes, approximately 200 reports of such have occurred in the past

300 years. But in 1998, scientists in U.K. came up with a more plausible explanation: the 'wick effect.'

Come to think of it, the idea that your body could emulate a candle wick is not really comforting, either. It still reduces your humanness to pile of charcoal in short order. And just  to  make  it  a  little  more gruesome, your arms and legs might be left intact. But at least there is some logic behind the wick effect.

On the BBC Television program Q.E.D. (quod erat demonstrandum, which means 'that which was to be demonstrated'), Dr. John DeHaan demonstrated the wick effect with a dead pig. They wrapped the poor thing in a blanket, then used a small drop of gasoline and a spark. It took a while for the flame to catch, but eventually it did, and flames began burning intensely hot but with low flames. The pig burned completely - even its bones were incinerated. But the surroundings were  mostly  spared  -  only  a nearby television, the floor below and the ceiling above the pig were affected by the fire. It's exactly what the result of most reported cases of spontaneous human combustion look like.

The theory behind the wick effect is that  the  spark  (for  a  human,  it might be a burning cigarette or a spark  from  a  fireplace)  burns

Most victims are alone and presumed to have fallen asleep so they don't immediately notice the spark. The fat is then absorbed into the clothing and behaves like a candle wick, fueling the flames until no fat is left.

You might think that a pig has a lot more fat than a human. We actually have a similar fat content to our porcine friends. So it makes sense that limbs would sometimes remain intact, since they contain less fat.

As for the recent case in Ireland, perhaps the coroner hadn't heard of  the  wick  effect.  But  to  this layperson's eye, Mr. Faherty seems like  a  prime  candidate. He was found next to an open fireplace, which gives a potential source for a spark.

One other interesting note: Faherty was diabetic. According to this 'Material Safety Data Sheet' from ScienceLab, a firm that supplies chemical and laboratory equipment, insulin may be combustible at high temperature. Just sayin'.
