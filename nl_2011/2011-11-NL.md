## AmigaOne &amp; Amiga Netbook

Big news from the Amiga world this  weekend.  That  stubborn bunch are holding AmiWest 2011 this weekend, and it's been one heck of an eventful little, uh, event. Not  only  will  the  AmigaOne X1000 start shipping by year's end, Hyperion  also  announced something  many  in  the  Amiga world have been waiting for for a long  time:  an  Amiga  laptop. Update: Steven Solie, AmigaOS' team lead, also held a presentation about the past, present, and future of AmigaOS. The team is working on some pretty interesting stuffprotected address space, multicore support,  USB3,  new  printing subsystem, and much more.

## X1000

It's been a long and sock-filled journey,  but  the  exciting  and unique  AmigaOne  X1000  is nearing completion. AmiKit, one of the main distributors of Amiga computers and related materials, is already taking pre-orders, with the computers  expecting  to  ship around Christmas. Thanks to its use of the rare P.A. Semi PowerPC processor, the X1000 is the only computer to ship with an Apple processor that isn't a Mac or iOS device.

The full list of specifications:

- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Dual-core  1.8GHz PowerISA v2.04+ CPU.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; "Xena" 500MHz XMOS XS1-L1 128 SDS.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; ATI Radeon R700 graphics card.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; 2GB RAM.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; 500GB Hard drive.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; 22x DVD combo drive.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Customised case, keyboard and mouse.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; 7.1 channel HD audio.
- GLYPH&lt;159&gt; Ports and connectors:
- § 4x DDR2 RAM slots.
- § 10x USB 2.0.
- § 1x Gigabit Ethernet.
- § 2x PCIe x16 slots (1x16 or 2x8).
- § 2x PCIe x1 slots.
- § 1x Xorro slot.
- § 2x PCI legacy slots.
- § 2x RS232.
- § 4x SATA 2 connectors.
- § 1x IDE connector.
- § JTAG connector.
- § 1x Compact Flash.

Before we get to the price, bear in mind that this computer was not designed  to  be  competitive  on price or even features. Basically, the X1000 was designed to be the best and fastest Amiga computer possible, with little regarded for keeping costs down. This machine is  not  for  average,  every-day users-this  is  for  the  Amiga connoisseur.  And  being  a connoisseur comes at a price. A hefty price.

'The 'First Contact' system includes the  official  AmigaOne  X1000 'Boing Ball' case in either black or white and includes the Nemo rev 2.1 motherboard complete with 1GB of DDR2 RAM, a Radeon HD4650 graphics card, 500GB HDD, DVR R/W optical drive, Audio &amp; Ethernet cards. Prices start  from  £1699  (excluding AmigaOS4  license,  shipping, handling  and  sales  tax),'  the AmigaKit  press  release  states. 'Optional extras include the 'Boing Ball' keyboard &amp; mouse, RAM, HDD &amp; Optical drive upgrade options plus Debian Squeeze preinstalled  in  a  dual  booting configuration with AmigaOS4.'

That's quite the price right there, especially since this listed price doesn't include the AmigaOS4 license just yet. Then again, as said, you can't expect a system with such exotic hardware to be cheap, and  I  doubt  those  that  have expressed interest in this machine will care too much about the price tag-much in the same way that Bethesda  could  ask  €150  for Skyrim and I'd still buy it without a shred of doubt.

## Amiga Netbook

Good news, then, that something else lies on the horizon, something Amiga fans have been asking and hoping for for a long time now. Yes, at AmiWest, Hyperion, the company that develops AmigaOS, has  announced  a  PowerPC netbook which is already running AmigaOS4. Sticker shock won't be an issue here-the netbook will cost  between  $300  and  $500

(which includes AmigaOS4), which would make this the perfect entrylevel  Amiga  machine.  If  they manage to hit the $300 price point, I'm pretty sure they'd be able to push quite a few of these (relative to the  more  expensive  X1000  and various sam440-based Amigas).

So, what can we expect from this machine? Well, it's 'sourced in a special  configuration  from  an OEM.' Current prototypes have an integrated graphics chip, 512 MB of RAM, a few gigabytes of storage, the  usual  array  of USB/audio/ethernet ports, and a wireless chip. AmigaOS4 is already running on it, but in an early state. It  is  expected  to  be  released somewhere in mid-2012.

This is very exciting news. If you had asked me only a few years ago if any alternative operating system with special hardware requirements could survive, you'd get a clear and duh-like 'no'-and yet, here we are, with the X1000 right around the corner,  the  AmigaOne  500  by Acube, and now an Amiga netbook on the horizon.

Exciting times indeed. I'm happy there are real Amigans working on real Amigas, instead of people just slapping a logo on an Atom box and charging €1200 for the privilege to  run  Ubuntu  on  an  outdated machine. Can you imagine people doing the latter? My, that would be just silly!
