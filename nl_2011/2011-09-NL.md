## AmigaOne X1000 News

AmigaOne X1000 To Ship to Beta Testers Next Week

How about we end this weekend on a happy note? Something we can all agree on is a good thing, so that we can all be happy and frolic and hand out hugs and kisses? I've got a video for you guys and girls. A  production  video  of  how  a certain  motherboard  is  being assembled. However, this is no ordinary board. This is the rev. 2.1 version of the A-eon AmigaOne X1000 - which will be shipped out to beta testers next week.

The  video  shows  part  of  the production  process  of  the AmigaOne X1000's motherboard, called 'Nemo,' which is being assembled  by  Varisys,  a  UK company.

[Editor's note: For the video, see the website link indicated below.]

This is good news in and of itself, but  even  better  is  that  after countless  delays,  the  first machines will finally ship to beta testers starting next week (next, as in, the week starting August 8). As far as I know, a select group of people were already playing with previous revisions of the board.

As  far  as  software  goes,  the AmigaOS developers are currently working on adding Nemo support to AmigaOS; AmigaOS 4.2 will ship with the AmigaOne X1000. In addition, Varisys has Debian Squeeze running on the Nemo rev. 2.1 board, so even if you don't like AmigaOS, this exotic piece of hardware might still appeal to you.

In case you forgot, what makes this an exotic piece of hardware? Well, it comes with a PA Semi dualcore PA6T-1682M running at 1.8GHz. This is probably your only chance to get your hands on a processor made by Apple that's not stuck in a Mac. That alone makes it pretty extraordinary. Add to  that  the  'Xena'  500MHz XMOS XS1-L2 124,  and  this board  is  unlike  pretty  much anything else out there. I'm not knowledgeable enough to really understand what developers can do with such an XMOS chip, but I'm sure you guys can enlighten me.

All in all though, the AmigaOne X1000 is a true Amiga in that we're  not  looking  at  a  default Chinese OEM box with a slow Intel  Atom  processor  and  an Amiga sticker flung on top sold at three times the OEM price, but at a machine with unique hardware you won't be getting anywhere else. I'm holding on to my hat for the eventual price point, but thank god we still have people willing to take a gamble like this.

I can't wait until I can get my hands on a review unit for loan

(nice case, too, but I prefer white). And yes, that was a very subtle hint.

## Amiga And Related News

In the Amiga (and related) world, it's not every month you have something to report. According to reports seen on Amiga.org, another small handful of Natami boards is  being  produced  for testers  and  developers. Presumably this is another small step toward an actual production run which will be available for sale. I've been interested in the Natami project since its inception, and would be willing to buy a system if it can deliver on its promise of advancement on the 'classic' Amiga hardware design while  maintaining  backward compatibility, even at a hardware level. I'm a little skeptical of the claims,  mainly  because  100 percent backward compatibility never happens even on minimal updates  to  the  same  system, much less a major upgrade design by people not directly connected to  the  original  Commodore engineers.

Even if Natami proves not to be to your  or  my  liking,  it  may  be possible to get your 'new Amiga hardware' fix from the Minimig people.  Minimig  in  its  various incarnations keeps steaming along, with the high-end reaching into AGA,  RTG,  and  68060 functionality  (though  as  I understand it, the CPU itself may need to be on its own card, rather than incorporated into the FPGA chip). Still, it will be possible to have a new clone of your old highend Amiga system sooner or later, not surpassing the old specs like Natami (or the OS4 / MorphOS systems)  but  still  potentially valuable. I don't know about you, but I still have software or uses for my Amiga that still require the original hardware, or an adequate re-creation or emulation thereof, and it would be very nice to have a newer machine doing the same old things, without worrying about some  decades-old  component crapping  out.  While  the  newer, faster, systems and software are great in their own right, there will always be a place in my heart the older stuff.

I just got back into playing some of the older games like Datastorm again.  On  the  software  (and gaming) side of things, there are a few notables. Jeff Minter, famous Amiga game creator (and Atari, and

Commodore, and Jaguar, and…) has turned his attention to the iOS handheld devices recently. What caught  my  attention  is  his iPhone/iPad  game  'Minotron 2112,' itself a slight update on the Amiga/ST classic 'Llamatron 2112' (which was also an update on the arcade classic 'Robotron 2084'). Aside  from  some  extra  visual effects and the strange desire to make all the text look like it came from an Intellivision, it appears very familiar to fans of the 1991 original.

of the OWB web browser, version 1.14. With the new version comes a name change, to 'Odyssey' (or 'Odyssey  Web  Browser,'  or 'OWB'), and a continuing march, along  with  Netsurf  and  the Timberwolf project, to modern Internet  viability  for  Amiga, Morph, AROS, and whatnot.

On the MorphOS front, there are two noteworthy ports available now.  One  is  the  CD/DVD burning  program  'Frying  Pan,' now available  free  and  Morphnative.  I  haven't  had  the opportunity to check it out in detail, but  it  looks  potentially  quite valuable. Frying Pan was formerly commercial software now available free, but it is still possible to pay for your 'pan, if you are inclined to support the author. Another recent port is the game 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein,' for those who enjoy shooting up some Nazis. In the same  mold  as  other  ports  like Doom, and the Quakes, you need to own a copy of the PC game, as the MorphOS version is just the main program, and the game data is installed from the game CD itself. Finally, there is yet another version

I suppose it has been a while since I  have  put  together  an  editor column  with  mostly  news  as opposed to the usual editorialslash-opinion  piece.  Don't  go getting used to it, because I can't promise this much news every month.
