## Interesting Times

It's an interesting time in the world of  Amiga-esque  stuff,  at  least somewhat. Probably the biggest, realest piece of news is that of the Amiga  X1000  boards  entering production,  and  thus  closer  to reaching end users. While I have little  idea  what  to  expect,  I  do respect A-EON and their relations for attempting to create a new and innovative PPC system with Amiga OS  in  mind,  that  is  not  at  a embedded system or netbook-like specification.  Regardless  of  my presumptions and MorphOS bias, I wish them all the success they can handle.

Our old f(r)iend Commodore USA has been getting some press lately, with some promotional material connected to the DVD/Blu-Ray release of the movie 'Tron Legacy.' For those not already familiar with C-USA,  they  intend  to  put  out various generic PC hardware in cases that mimic the form factor of classic  Commodore  or  Amiga computers - a direct replica of the Commodore 64 case in one specific example, and include Ubuntu Linux with  Commodore  or  Amiga emulators included and 'skins' to put across some of the legacy look. I wonder exactly who will be the ones  taking  the  bait  for  these 'Commodore'  machines.  The hardware is nothing to write home about, and the software can pretty much be had on your own PC for next to nothing - which just leaves the cases. Some of those can even be had from other sources. It feels like a pretty half-assed attempt to cash in on ignorant nostalgia, but I guess if it helps the Commodore and Amiga names to get a little more attention, it can't be all bad, even if the actual product might be.

Speaking of getting the name out there, an image surfaced recently of Chinese-made  Android  tablet computers with the Amiga logo, presumably part of some of the licensing agreements made a while back.  If  the  price  is  right,  the hardware isn't terrible and it wasn't some kind of April fools' hoax, I'd be tempted to get one, though this really isn't any different in principle than all the Commodore USA stuff I bad-mouthed above (aside from type of hardware being shilled for names and nostalgia).

Finally, I thought I'd share one more bit of something I found in what  could  be  called  'spring cleaning.' Last month I brought in a bunch of Amiga (and related) magazines, giving club members a chance at them before I tossed them into the recycling bin. It went better than expected, and several magazines found new homes, most going to Bill Core. The number of mags I gave away or recycled pales in comparison to the amount I held on to, but at least I got to clear some space, as well as read through a lot of old magazines to determine which to keep. It's sad to look back and realize how much was done with Amiga hardware and software in the eighties and nineties, and how  little  is  being  done  today.

Anyway, there was one special treat I found in the April 1994 issue of Amazing Computing - roughly the same time Commodore was declaring bankruptcy, though this was not known to AC yet. In a sort of April fool, they present a news item from the far-flung year of 2004  -  the  debut  of Commodore's  Amiga  personal Augmentation Device (PAD) 28. It was  presented  as  a  hand-held device with a color touch-screen, built-in  camera  and  video capabilities, and wireless cellular networking. Sound familiar? Not all the-details match up of course, but  it  certainty  seems  similar enough to Apple's iPad to notice, even if hypotheti-Commodore beat the truth to the punch by a few good years. I'm guessing neither Commodore/Amiga nor Apple would be likely  to  choose  Mel Gibson for their advertising like the  article  suggested.  Maybe Charlie Sheen is available instead?

## 802.11ac Wireless Tech

The wireless networking industry is already  making  plans  and developing  products  for  the successor to 802.11n - a standard both  the  IEEE  and  the  Wi-Fi Alliance refers to as 802.11ac. In fact, in a meeting I attended last week with representatives from one of the top networking hardware vendors, allusions were made to the fact that the company has started focusing on developing products for this  new  generation  of  wireless technology.

There  isn't  a  lot  of  detailed information  available  on  the 802.11ac standard, so I wanted to get the latest information from the folks  in  the  know  -  the  Wi-Fi Alliance.  Kelly  Davis-Felner, marketing director for the group, provided  some  insight  into  the process of 802.11ac's ratification.

802.11ac only operates in the 5 GHz spectrum,  which  is  a  clearer spectrum with less interference. It is also  called  VHT,  short  for  Very High Throughput. 802.11ac is ideal for home digital applications like video as it is capable of performing at  1  Gbps  of  raw  data  rates. Compare that to what we have today, the  most  powerful  802.11n networking devices can achieve 600 Mbps.

Davis-Felner  said  that  kind  of throughput could 'transmit 3 HD videos at the same time.' She also said that the Wi-Fi Alliance has a task group in place for defining the market requirements for 802.11ac. The  Wi-Fi  Alliance  is  the  body responsible for certifying networking products as being compatible with a particular wireless standard and you can often see its label on most major networking products' packaging.

Davis-Felner expects certification to launch middle-to-late next year. She said one of the most asked questions about the standard is, will it take as long to ratify and certify as 802.11n? Davis-Felner said that the Wi-Fi Alliance's members say, 'there are lots  of  things  from  a  progress standpoint to make sure it doesn't take as long' and that 'the Wi-Fi Alliance  takes  its  cues  from  the marketplace and not the IEEE.'

That means we can expect to see 802.11ac products available on the market before the IEEE ratifies the standard.  Remember  all  of  the 802.11n  draft  routers  that  were available before 802.11n was ratified in September 2009?

According to the Wi-Fi Alliance, in 802.11ac, devices are required to support 20, 40, and 80 Mhz channels. The use of 160 Mhz channels is optional but supported. 802.11ac pushes channel bonding even further than 802.11n. Channel bonding is a technology  introduced  with  the 802.11n  standard  that  improves bandwidth by combining channels. There  are  a  few  caveats  with channels  and  802.11ac  however, mostly  based  on  geographic locations. Channels exceeding 40 MHz bandwidth  in  Europe  and Japan have not received regulatory approval. VHT 5G devices confined

Also, in China, the  limited  available  bandwidth implies that 160 MHz channels are not available.

I also asked Davis-Felner about WiGig,  a  wireless  technology standard that is capable of 7 Gbps throughput that's seven times faster than even wired Gigabit Ethernet. While WiGig is not a replacement for 802.11n and 802.11ac, it can complement  both  of  those standards. Davis-Felner explained that 802.11n and ac can provide coverage for an entire home and that consumers can have available an 'island' of WiGig that operates at the 60 GHz band and can be dedicated for high-quality video and audio streaming or transmitting high performance wireless data.
