## Selling the Amiga Trademark

Always wanted to own the IP and trademarks of one of the most innovative computer brands in history?  A  brand  carried  by  a computer which was easily ten years ahead of its time, capable of multitasking  (in  colour)  with multiple resolutions displayed at the same time, while Windows were still windows and the Mac couldn't hold more than 8 pages in its word processor on its singletasking monochrome operating system?  Yes,  Bill  McEwen's Amiga, Inc. is selling the Amiga trademark and all associated IP. It's not like the guy was doing anything with it anyway.

Amiga, Inc.'s role in the Amiga world of today is a rather unclear one - even after following the Amiga community for a quite a while now, I'm still not entirely sure what Amiga, Inc. actually does, other than hold the Amiga trademark  and  associated intellectual property.

As far as I know, the complicated history kind of goes like this. In 1982, Jay Miner founded Hi-Toro, later  renamed  as  Amiga Corporation.  In  1984, Commodore International bought Amiga Corporation. Then, in 1994, Commodore International went belly-up, selling all its assets to a German computer company called Escom, which in turn went under in  1996.  Gateway  2000  then bought the Amiga brand, but they had to sell it again in 1999 to Amino Development for 5 million USD.  Gateway  retained ownership of Amiga's patents.

By  the  way,  those  patents  are probably worth a damn fortune at this point - you could sue pretty much  every  single  computer company (hard and software) with that  stuff,  since  the  Amiga pioneered on both the soft and hardware front. The fun part? The Amiga patent portfolio is currently owned by… Acer. Gateway 2000 is currently an Acer subsidiary, so if  Acer  ever  feels  the  need  to litigate  because  they  can't compete… Well, computer world, hold on to your panties.

Amino  Development  was  Bill McEwen's company, and still is today, renamed as Amiga, Inc. The  original  press  release  for Amino's purchase of the Amiga trademark is… Cruel. Just… Cruel. Heartbreaking. 'Yee-haw' said Bill McEwen in that press release. 'This is a very exciting day, and now  an  even  more  exciting tomorrow. Now we can finish the job that was started 15 years ago.' Yeah.

And that's where we're at now. Amiga,  Inc.  never  produced anything, and as far as I know, its role in the Amiga world was to not respond to requests to give out licenses for Amiga hardware. This changed about a year ago when Hyperion (developers of AmigaOS  4)  and  Amiga,  Inc. settled their lawsuit.

Amiga,  Inc.'s  last  act  was  to license the Amiga hardware brand to Commodore USA, the rather comical outfit who decided to threaten us with legal action in this year's largest lolwut?-story on OSNews. And now Bill McEwen is selling the Amiga trademark and related  IP  (as  said,  that's without patents, those belong to Acer).

'We  are  very  excited  to  be working with Pluritas as Amiga has  developed  a  platform  in which  a  strategic  buyer  or investor can launch new products and technologies that are game changers for the consumer and industry,' McEwen said.

In  an  ideal  situation,  either Hyperion or A-eon snaps this stuff  up.  Let's  hope  they  can spare a few dimes.

## Amiga Brand Dragged Through Mud

Oh. My. God. When I read this, and browsed the website, my face went like this. Do you remember the  Amiga?  That  fun  little computer that was miles ahead of its competition, but in recent years has been dragged through the mud by one shady figure after the next? Here's a new one: Amiga, Inc., the one 'run' by Bill McEwen, has partnered with a company called IContain to slap the Amiga logo on a bunch of low-end, incredibly sad products. Whether this is another shady  deal  I  don't  know,  but worthy of the Amiga? I don't think so.  I'm  not  putting  this  in  the Amiga  category,  by  the  way.  I refuse to. Forget it. It's going into our  generic  category.  Fitting. Update: As was pointed out over at AmigaWorld.net, not only are these nothing more than brandless OEM products with Photoshopped logos, the website itself is just a standard, unmodified WordPress theme. Oi. Doesn't instill a lot of confidence, now, does it?

It's  supposedly  a  bunch  of products directed at something called the 'rent-to-own' market, which, in my book, sounds like something the Beeper King would come up with. The website is at least functional - unlike some of the  other  truly  shady  Amiga businesses out there - but the products…

They're generic, brandless OEM boxes with 'Amiga' and the boing ball logo Photoshopped all over them. Android tablets and phones, a bunch of all-in-one computers, and even televisions. The laptops section is empty. But wait! We have quotes!

'From NASA to Disney, everyone loved Amiga in the past for its innovation,' says IContain CEO Todd  Kleperis.  'It  only  makes sense  that  they  would  lead  the charge with a revolutionary new way  to  enhance  personal connectivity.  We  are  extremely happy to have a partner in bringing the next line of connected devices to market and helping the RTO world.'

'Amiga has continued to work on bringing new products with new partners, and we are pleased to be working with IContain providing new  hardware  and  software solutions that will benefit everyone,' adds Amiga CEO Bill McEwen.

Once, there was this girl. She was beautiful.  Smart.  Rich.  Had everything going for her. Then, she started sleeping around. Got herself involved with the wrong people. She disappeared for a few years. Didn't hear from her. Now, she's a crack whore selling herself on  the  side  of  the  roads  near Prague. She'll give it away for just a spoonful.

It seems that at this point, you're best off just sticking to the two companies who have been able to deliver:  Hyperion  and  ACube. They're real. They have products you can buy and run today that are actually really Amiga, not a Linux distribution  with  a  skin  or  a generic box with a Photoshopped boing ball. The X1000 should've been here by now, but it isn't, and these silly IContain products sure aren't going to make any Amigans' hearts boing any faster.

At least we have AROS.
