## Thoughts on Steve Jobs

Even though AmiTech got its start as an Amiga-only user group, I feel I would be delinquent if I didn't mention the passing of Apple co-founder and general tech guru Steve Jobs. Certainly the mainstream press couldn't shut up about him for at least two full days after his death, which is more coverage than the average celebrity death usually scores. Like many tech-company heads, Jobs was a controversial figure, to the point where some out there may think his cancer was somehow deserved. In addition to founding Apple with Steve Wozniak, he was a driving force behind the original Macintosh computer in 1984 until being edged out in 1985 after butting heads too many times with  the  CEO  he  helped  bring  in. Perhaps it was for the best, as it gave him the opportunity to try other things, and dust off his chops as a venture capitalist.

Perhaps the most successful of his bankrolled  projects  was  the  Pixar animation studio. It took several years to become a profitable concern, but is now  a  pioneering  force  in  the animation industry with an impressive track record of successful films, as well as Jobs' 'in' with global media bigwig Disney. Perhaps not as successful but still  influential  was  the  'NeXT' computer  company,  and  its  (then) B&amp;W 68040 UNIX/BSD system with GUI, which became the conceptual seed  for  the  Mac  OSX  operating system  series  upon  Jobs'  return  to Apple. It would seem Apple's (and Jobs') greatest successes were after his dismissal  and  subsequent  return, ushering in the era the 'i-stuff,' from the iMac to the iPod and iTunes to the iPhone  and  iPad,  along  with  the transition of Apple from underdog computer company to dominating tech device and media distributor. It's hard to say exactly how much of all that was directly attributable to Mr. Jobs, but given his famous penchant for control, perfectionism, and micro-management, probably more than you might expect. Along with greater success and market influence comes greater scrutiny, and Apple (and Jobs) are spoken of in the same strong-arming evil monolithic monopoly terms formerly reserved for Bill Gates and Microsoft.

The news of Steve Jobs' passing has predictably brought out the best and the worst in the online communities, respectively  deifying  or  decrying everything  about  the  deceased. Personally, I think a lot of the media coverage  and  online  praise  have overplayed the man's genius and his role in history a bit much. Then again, for every Apple 'cultist' overselling the importance of Jobs and the Apple philosophies, there seem to be at least as  many  downplaying to  an  insane degree. If you go to the right place, all you need is to show a photo with a person or a desk with an Apple-logoed product on it to bring people out of the woodwork who are more than happy to tell you how every last thing Apple makes is inferior in features or price-toperformance  ratios  (or  just 'everything') to the competing products, and how Steve Jobs has never actually done,  created,  or  accomplished anything,  ever.  I  take  the  more moderate view in the fight, knowing that both sides are prone to hyperbole. I can understand the 'cult' mentality, as  well  as  the  feeling  of  being  the smartest computer user in the room full of idiots - I've been an Amiga user, after all. I've had the pleasure of using Mac products at various points in the line's life, but never fell into the Apple cult,  partially  because  of  my

Amiga preferences, and partly from Apple's increased leaning toward their hand-held devices.

Even though I don't consider myself even mildly an Apple fanboy, I respect the contributions Steve Jobs made to the industry, and feel they were far greater than average. Jobs was one of the  first  true  champions  for  the 'common man' in the computer and tech gadget industries, pushing for product that didn't require a doctorate in engineering to use, or a doctoratelevel salary to pay for. He was the type to ask 'Can Grandma figure out how to use that?' and more frequently than others get a 'yes' in reply. Sometimes the philosophy went a little far, and end users became restricted by the concept of ease-of-use rather than aided, but the spirit was still admirable. As Windows/Linux users, or the antiApple biased in general will gladly tell you, Apple products are not usually the most powerful, or lowest priced, or most easily modified or expanded (especially if you're a techie type who likes to build your own systems), but they  frequently  represent  a  good balance between power, quality, and to a lesser extent price, tightly integrated into a stylish package  which often becomes a design influence on its competitors,  or  even  unrelated products, like toasters or lamps. While the  tech  and  products  came  from Apple engineers and other sources, Steve was the perfectionist controlfreak steering force behind it for a long time, and he seemed to have a pretty rare gift for understanding what the  public  wanted  well  enough  to provide it, or just convince them they wanted what Apple was selling. He was  frequently  (and  famously)  a douche to a lot of employees and other people, though that seems to be a  common trait for a lot of smart people  with  extremely  strong convictions.

If  you  have  some  time  to  waste,  I recommend  visiting  the  website Folklore.org. It is a large collection of anecdotes  about  and  from  Apple computer employees, focusing primarily on  the  development  of  the  original Macintosh  computer  in  the  early 'eighties. Not surprisingly, Steve Jobs features heavily in a lot of these stories, and it's an entertaining bit of history and insight,  likely  to  confirm  what  you already thought about the man as well as surprise you occasionally. He will be missed.  While  I  hardly  agreed  with everything he said or did, I feel the loss of his creativity and drive diminishes the industry, at least a bit if not a whole lot.

Sorry to turn the newsletter into the Steve Jobs memorial show this time around. It's largely out of my system now, so next month I'll concentrate on other things. For example a new 3.0 MorphOS is supposed to come out around the end of the year. I hear it will run on even more models of Apple Mac.

## Robo-Calling on Cellphones?

Federal lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow companies to make robo-calls  to  people's  cell  phones, sparking debate over mobile devices and business concerns.

The  House  Energy  and  Commerce subcommittee on Communications and Technology held a hearing Friday to discuss the Mobile Information Call Act of  2011 bill  sponsored by Rep. Lee Terry  (R.,  Neb.)  that  would  ease restrictions on telemarketing calls to mobile phones.

Terry  said  his  bill  is  a  badly-needed update  to  the  1991  Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, which prohibits automated dialing and prerecorded  voice  message  calls  to mobile phones.

The bill provides for consumers to optin to receive messages, which Terry says could help companies notify consumers about flight delays, product recalls, or credit card alerts. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.)  said  he  also  welcomes  the changes.

'Today, many American households have given  up  the  landline  and  rely exclusively on wireless service. Back then, wireless customers paid higher per-minute rates to receive calls; now, most  consumers  have  buckets  of minutes so that receiving an additional call costs them nothing,' Walden said. ' Given these changes to the market, now seems like a good time to revisit some of the rules the TCPA put in place.'

current state and said, at the very least, the 'prior express consent' portion of the bill must be more clearly defined.

'In fact, my constituents have spoken very clearly - they don't like this bill,' she said. 'I've heard from many, many constituents,  and  they  don't  like  it. They've  written  to  me  since  this legislation was introduced; nearly every letter was in opposition.'

Eschoo's  comments  echo  those expressed in Wisconsin's statehouse earlier  this  year  when  senator  Van Wanggaard drafted a bill that would ban unwanted text messaging much like the state's no-call list does for phone calls.

In  explaining  the  idea,  Wanggaard notes many cellular customers have to pay for all incoming text messages, a complaint  resembling  a  similar argument used to create the statewide no-call list. The senator says adding a provision to cover texts would bring the law into the 21st century.

In both instances, the proposals seek to update legislation created before the proliferation of mobile devices, and there is little debate laws need to be updated. But the way in which such laws should be changed, either to allow or  prohibit  greater  accessibility  to mobile phones, will likely continue.

Both legislators said the measure won't unleash telemarketers on unsuspecting wireless  consumers,  but  Rep.  Anna Eschoo (D., Calif.) isn't so sure. The subcommittee's  ranking  member  is concerned  people  may  opt-in  to receiving robo-calls and unknowingly open themselves up to unwanted calls. Eschoo doesn't support the bill in its
