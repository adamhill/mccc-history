## An Amiga App Store

It's been an exciting summer so far. The  weather,  specifically  a  hailproducing storm, hasn't been kind to our cars, or the trees in the back yard. If that wasn't enough, Saturday a deer came out of nowhere and bounced off the front of the house, knocking out a storm window (It's worth noting that I've never seen any deer in the local area previously in the near-forty years I've been alive.) I feel there's some kind of message or omen to be found here, but damned if I can tell what it is.

For once there actually has been some news in the Amiga area of things. For this  month's  meeting  I  will  be demonstrating a few games designed to run in HTML5, which run in the OWB web browser on MorphOS. They may work in OWB for Amiga OS4 or AROS as well, but I'm not currently able to test them. Perhaps the highest-profile game available to play in this format (and for free) is iPhone juggernaut Angry Birds. I was able to get it running on OWB on my Pegasos, albeit without audio, and kinda slow (it's slow on my Linux laptop too). It is nice to have one more of those  'big  name'  games available to play, even if it's through the  abstraction  of  a  web  browser window.

Finally on this month's news parade, our  friend  Bill  Panagouleas  of DiscreetFX is working to go live with the  web  site  'Project  Metropolis,' which tries to bring the 'app store' model  of  software  sales  and distribution to the Amiga and Amigastyle systems. There's not much to see yet (though I have been asked to put together a mascot for the site), but at least  there's  some  potential  here. Looking  on  the  optimistic  side, something like this could conceivably improve the fortunes of the Amiga software market. It offers a central hub  for  customers  to  (hopefully conveniently) find and purchase the software  they  want,  and  offers programmers a means to sell  and distribute their software, trading a small percentage for (again hopefully) a convenient sales venue and a greater customer base than going it alone. In a best case scenario, there might be more  incentive  to  make  more elaborate software comparable to the good old days. Even without the ideal situation, it should eventually become easier  to  get  a  wider  variety  of commercial Amiga-related software from a central point. I look forward to seeing  where  it  goes,  and  respect DiscreetFX  for  putting  forth  the effort and investment.

## Monopoly Protection Bill

In North Carolina, a new law severely restricts the ability of communities to build their own broadband networks. Pushed through the North Carolina legislature by Internet providers Time Warner  and  CenturyLink,  the  bill allows existing community networks to continue but makes it illegal for them to expand into new territory.

Brian Bowman is the public affairs manager for the city of Wilson, N.C. Wilson has a successful community fiber optic network called Greenlight, which now serves 6,000 residents and local businesses.

Brian  Bowman:  Our  current members don't have to worry about losing any services, we'll continue  to  provide  them. However we've had quite a few folks  from  outside  Wilson County who have asked about possible  partnerships  with Wilson. You know, just some way to try to get that infrastructure to them because we're the only ones in this part of the state who have an all-fiber network. That can't happen now. We're pretty much landlocked within our county.

This was the fourth attempt by cable lobbyists  to  protect  their  turf  by outlawing  newer,  faster,  cheaper networks.

Brian Bowman: There were a lot of  folks  calling  this  the 'Monopoly  Protection  Bill' because essentially what it's going to do, the effect is gonna be that a lot of communities in North Carolina,  in  fact  most communities in North Carolina will  not  have  a  choice  now. They'll be stuck with cable, if they get it, or DSL - if they can get it. Some folks may be stuck with dialup  and  satellite  for  the foreseeable future.

Gov. Bev Purdue did not veto the bill but made it clear that she was not in favor of it. She asked the legislature to revisit the bill to give communities more options.

Brian Bowman: We do know that the cable companies' lobbyists are very close to a lot of the lawmakers in Raleigh, and they're not going to stop. I imagine that next year they'll come up with a bill  that  would  try  to  go  even deeper  into  local  broadband networks in North Carolina. So I doubt this is over yet. I would be surprised if they'd be willing to give any ground.

Joel Kelsey, policy analyst for Free Press, says that the North Carolina law is at odds with the federal stance on community broadband. A bipartisan coalition of senators introduced federal legislation  to  protect  community broadband efforts a few years ago, and the National Broadband Plan calls for that protection as well.

Joel Kelsey: I think it is time for the federal government to revisit this  question and come in and protect the communities in North Carolina from this ill-founded and corporate-funded legislation…because we know one thing - and that's that the private companies aren't going to go there any time soon.

## Broadband at 1 gigabit/second

A residential broadband provider in Sonoma County, California, is about to blow the top off broadband service business models and offer a fiber-tothe-home  1  gigabit  per  second connection that includes two phone lines  with  unlimited  long-distance calling for only $69.95 a month.

How fast is 1 gibabit per second? A full-length DVD can be downloaded in seconds. You can tune into crystal clear HD  TV  channels  with  enough bandwidth left over to download and play music, surf the Web, get X-rays from  your  doctor  and  have  a teleconference for work - all at the same time.

Sonic  has  its  own  facilities-based network  that  offers  voice  and broadband. And when Sonic begins to roll  out its own new fiber network, which is much faster than copper, the price for its voice and data packages will  remain  the  same.  Dane  Jasper, Sonic's CEO, says that, as a competitor in the broadband market, he has to think differently and cater to consumer needs.

Dane Jasper: We sort of re-thought the business model and tried to determine what is an exciting and aggressive broadband product be it on copper or fiber.

With its copper wire connections, Sonic created a popular untiered, uncapped and unlimited data and voice service with a choice of one or two phone lines.

Broadband  packages  through incumbent AT&amp;T are priced according to broadband speed. But speed isn't expensive  once  you  have  the connection.

Dane Jasper: Someone in one household might be paying $40 and  getting  a  6  megabit connection,  and  next  door somebody  paying  $10  less  is getting one quarter the speed. And that  is  not  rational.  The technology and cost basis for that is  not  rational.  That  is  market segmentation. The goal there is to get the consumer to open their wallet wider by artificially limiting what  is  being  delivered.  And where your cost of goods sold is very  low  -  in  other  words, bandwidth is super cheap - the creation of that slowdown to get people to spend more money, that market segmentation is rational when  you're  an  incumbent operator  who  controls  the majority of the market.

Sonic will put fiber directly into 60 homes in the city of Sebastapol. An additional 640 homes are slated to join the project by the end of the year. If the project is successful in growing Sonic's market share, expansion will continue. So far, so good. Sonic has skyrocketed, it now boasts a staff of 100, and the company is hiring to keep up with the demand.
