## RAM for an Amiga 1200

Ever since I found out that the PCMCIA  slot  on  the  Amiga  1200  can  be used with a static ram cards to be used for  memory expansion, I have played with various 1 meg cards that my Dad and I happened to have from back in the day. I have found a great price on a 2 meg card which I will explain more in a moment. My Dad and I didn't have any cards higher than 1 meg, and the following is the reason why:

From  our experience the Static Ram cards were good for data storage until the  flash  ram  came  out.  You  could store  the  information  on  static  ram cards  as  long  as  you  have  a  battery backup.  When the  battery  goes  dead, you  loose  all  your  information.  That was acceptable until a means of storage came out that you didn't have to keep up with the battery. This is why I used the Newton Messagepad over the Atari  Portfolio  as  much  as  I  like  the Atari  name.    Newton  had  flash  Ram and the Portfolio had static Ram.

So when the 2 meg cards started coming out, that was when the flash Ram cards  started  becoming  common.  So naturally  fewer  and  fewer  static  ram cards were made at that point. Actually as  I  have  been  hitting  Ebay  it  seems like the static Ram cards became more about  adding  memory  than  data  storage.  For  the  Amiga  1200  (and  600  I believe)    a  lot  of  these  cards  work, though  there  are  some  proprietary cards that will not work on the Amiga PCMCIA port. It has been relayed to me  that  the  Amiga  will  use  up  to  6 megs  of  memory  from  the  PCMCIA port, and ignore the rest at that point.

While a 6 Meg Static Ram card would be costly so is about any other static card Ram out there.   Most of the time even a 512K static Ram card will run $40,  and  a  4  meg  card  about  $80  to $100.  These cards are crap for storage but gold to Amiga users, and probably part of the reason why they maintain the price.

This is where I am happy to say there is one card I tested out, the Fujisoku 2 meg  PCMCICA  card  which  I  bought for $20

and which yielded these results:

It  is  the  '1,909,360  other  mem'  part that we are cheering for in this case. I have effectively doubled my Ram with just $20 and by shoving a card in the PCMCIA slot. Not since the Ram upgrades on the Atari 800 have I seen a more simple Ram upgrade, and I didn't even have to open a hatch. Of course the static Ram card sticks out the side a bit, so you have to watch that. These have  been  showing  up  from  time  to time  lately  so  a  batch  of  them  must have been recently 'unearthed.' If interested, the Ebay auction number was 161549060146 with prof-dean as the seller.  The  price  point  has  generally been the same for the auctions I have seen of this item.

## Thoughts on CGI

Scanning  through  the  Amiga  news scene, there are a few things going on. An  Amiga  RGB  to  component  video cable  adapter  is  available,  making  a high quality TV hookup easier. I'm not sure of the exact nature of the adapter, but it would appear the compatibility with various Amiga video modes and scan rates depends on the versatility of your TV or monitor.

A small update to Personal Paint (version  7.3a)  is  available  for  68K-based Amigas  and  OS4  systems,  available through  the  AmiStore  app  store  or direct download, or even on a CF card. As a long-time PPaint user, I'll  likely get a copy sooner or later, though what I really want to see is a version which runs on my MorphOS system without the 'quirkiness' of the legacy versions. Also  available  from  the  AmiStore  is zTools 1.3, a package of useful system utilities  and  applications  for  OS4  systems.  Finally,  a  new  version  (2.9)  of AROS  Vision,  a  drop-in  OS  replacement  for  classic  68K-based  Amiga systems, is available for free. It comes with a good amount of software included. I'll admit I'm not sure what specific advantages  AROS  Vision  offers  over the  Amiga  OS  3.x,  but  if  one  has  a spare classic machine to work with, it could be fun finding out.

As an Amiga fan, I have a long-standing  interest  in  computer  generated graphics and animation. I still like to try squeezing high-quality images and renders  out  of  older  software  pretty often. The nature of computer generated  imagery  has  shifted  over  time  as technology and horsepower have grown.  Computer  generated  images and effects have been around longer than some people may assume, appearing  in  television  shows  and  major motion pictures as early as the 1970s. By  the  1990s,  CG  advanced  to  the point where nearly anything could be rendered  to  the  screen  realistically, and the tech just got faster and more powerful from there, until CG effects have come to be seen as cheap and overused  (and  it  often  is,  especially with those who are happy to substitute visual  effects  in  place  of  things  like cinematography  or  story  telling).  We can  look  at  Toy  Story,  the  first  fulllength  CG  animated  movie,  as  a  bit dated  and  primitive  today  (especially when viewing the humans or animals in that film), and compare to the film's own  sequels,  which  come  off  better. Improvements in technology and software are part of this, but another bit element is style. You've probably heard  of  the  'uncanny  valley,'  the concept where, when something like an animation becomes a closer representation of a human or other familiar living  thing,  imperfections  and  differences are magnified in our perception, making it more off-putting than something less realistic. Pixar and other CG animation studios learned to avoid this by  making  their  human  characters more cartoony than realistic, as truly realistic  rendered  humans  frequently seem more like  moving  mannequins or  even  corpses,  at  least  until  something truly indistinguishable from live action  is  achieved.  The  thing  I  find fascinating  is  while  computer-animated  cartoons  are  increasingly  stylized

and  cartoony,  the  surface  texture,  at least  in  big  time  feature  films,  has pushed  to  be  as  photo-realistic  as possible.  Take  a  film  like  'Up,'  for example. The main character has skin with pores and razor stubble, realistic hair and clothing, even though he's a short stump of a man with a head that is  literally  squared-off.  What  excites me  now  is  that,  where  the  tech  has made realism 'easy' now, experiments and variation in style and artistry are rising up again. While 'The Lego Movie'  is  rendered  in  photo-real  CGI  (of plastic  bricks),  the  animation  is  purposefully designed to look like something that could be achieved in stop-motion  filming  of  real  Legos  (if they  had  access  to  the  billions  of pieces needed to make the huge set pieces seen on screen). On the way are CG  films  for  Popeye  and  Peanuts. Early trailers for Peanuts are interesting as they closely resemble the animation  style  of  the  classic  TV  specials, even if Snoopy has a realistic fur texture  now.  On  the  other  end  of  the spectrum, you have shorts like 'Feast' and 'Paperman' which change up the rendering,  trading  photo-realism  for something that could easily be mistaken for hand-drawn 2D animation. Cool, yet  also  a  little  sad  when  real  2D drawn animation is all but completely dead  in  US  feature  films.  Still,  it  all goes to show what many of us Amiga users  knew all  along,  and  some  filmmakers  and  executives  have  yet  to learn  -  that  computer  graphics  is  a tool for artist creativity, and not an end unto itself.
