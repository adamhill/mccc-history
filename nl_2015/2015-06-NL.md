## Amiga Anniversary and Tinkering with Pi

Some updates are available in the Amiga sphere. ISO image files of the Amiga OS 4.1 'final  edition'  are  available  for  download (restricted  to  paying  customers  only,  presumably  so  buyers  don't  have  to  rely  on discs). The MorphOS team has just released version 3.8 of their operating system, adding support for the Sam-460 system boards by ACube. The supported number of Radeon video cards has increased as well, and the ability to drive 4K resolution displays has  been  added,  along  with  a  bunch  of other under-the-hood tweaks and improvements.

Finally, the Kickstarter campaign has borne fruit,  and  there  will  be  an  Amiga  30th Anniversary event in the USA, held on July 25th  and  26th  at  the  Computer  History Museum in Mountain View California. Several exhibitors are promised, along with a display  of  the  history  of  the  Amiga  from original  machines  to  recent  derived  hardware and operating systems, possibly even including  some  rare  prototype  items  unseen by the public. If I could, I would be there in a heartbeat. I miss the days when I  could  travel  relatively  consequence-free. Hopefully lots of pictures will come out of the  event.

It  seems  I'm  always  tinkering  with  one system  or  another  any  more,  from  MorphOS  machines  to  various  Linux-based boxes. Most recently I have been working with  the  tiny  Raspberry  Pi  computer.  I never really planned to get one in the first place, but when AmiTech member-at-large Jim  Lawrence  offered  one  for sale, it seemed a convenient opportunity to try out something  new,  and  getting  the  working

part of a new system in hand for $37 was tough to resist. For a while, I didn't even have a purpose in mind for the Pi (actually Pi 2 model B), but eventually settled on the idea of setting it up as a media player and (retro) game console for my room, hopefully  for  as  little  money  as  possible.  The Raspberry Pi is shipped as a bare board, so a  case  of  some  kind  was  required.  Many have  built  cases  out  of  Lego  bricks,  so  I tried to as well, as my stash of Lego stuff would result in a free (or at least paid for long ago) case. Despite my efforts, I caved in and bought a plastic case, as the Lego case was rather bulky and awkward, especially  when  compared  to  a  plastic  case molded barely larger than the circuit board itself. I also got a wi-fi adapter which plugs into  a  USB  port,  along  with  necessary  cables,  power supplies, and micro SD cards. For software and operating system, I went with  NOOBS,  which  streamlines  the  process  of  installing  one  or  more  operating systems to the Pi SD card. It covers a lot, but does not directly include 'RetroPie,' an OS and interface for several game console and  computer  emulators.  With  a  little  research,  I  was  able  to  splice  RetroPie  into the NOOBS installation.

As  of  about  a  month  ago,  I  was  able  to demonstrate  the  Pi  at  the  last  meeting, which did not go so well. First off, it's worth mentioning that while the Raspberry Pi is a tiny system, it still needs to be wired to power, monitor, and whatever control devices you wish to use, leading to a potential inconvenient tangle of cables and supporting hardware. In some ways it's worse than a  'normal'  computer  system,  as  that  has the mass to anchor all the wires and stuff. The media center software, called 'OpenELEC,' was frequently unstable and refused to boot more often than not. It turned out the power supply I got was a little weak for the Pi, leading to a little display indicator popping  up  on  screen  whenever  the  voltage dipped. It seems the problem may be the wireless  dongle  sucking  too  much  power, but I got a beefier power supply, along with other hardware to go to my ultimate goal of a  Raspberry  media  and  gaming  center.  I have a little ways to go yet, but I am close

to my final Raspberry goal, though my goal of  keeping  it  as  cheap  as  possible  may have fallen to the side. I'll bring it to the meeting, and I can promise better than the mix  of  'doesn't  work'  and  'kinda  works' that  I  had  at  the  last  meeting.  The  notcompletely final tally goes as follows:

- Raspberry Pi 2 mainboard: $37
- Various micro-SD cards $30
- Power supply $7
- HDMI cable $6
- USB Wi-Fi adapter $10
- Black plastic case $8
- Better power supply $18
- 1 TB external USB hard drive $65
- 22 inch HDTV $170
- USB power cable with switch $6
- Wireless mini keyboard/trackpad $15
- Total: $342

I'm still working on getting an ideal game controller for this setup, but that won't add a lot to the total. I can only hope that all this effort won't result in something I will ultimately ignore like other projects I ended up sinking a lot of time and money into.

## Dumb 'Smart' Gadgets

I believe I have identified the one thing in tech  that  is  incontrovertibly  in  a  bubble. To know whether a product or startup is in this category-which I'm confident will see a shakeout leaving few standing-just look for this phrase in their marketing materials: 'The world's first smart…'

The world's first smart socks. The world's first  smart  toothbrush.  The  world's  first smart plate, cup, fork, cutting board, stove knob,  jump  rope,  shoes,  shirt,  aquarium, frying pan. The world's first smart detector of the gas that we pass.

All  of  the  devices  I  just  named  are  real, even the last one, which is currently a fully functional  prototype  whose  inventor  is seeking funding  on  Kickstarter. Called CH4 (the chemical formula for methane), it clips onto your back pocket and connects to  an  app  that  correlates  how  often  you pass gas with what you eat. I thought it was a parody, but its creator, Rodrigo Narciso, a recent graduate of New York University's Interactive  Telecommunications  Program, insists he is completely in earnest.

Indeed,  being  earnest  seems  to  be  a  requirement  for  committing  your  career  to making  an  everyday  object  'smart.'  Take the  team  behind  Vessyl,  the  world's  first smart drinking cup, the promotional video for which is so over the top in its talk of changing the world that it was satirized by comedian Stephen Colbert.

Nic  Barnes,  head  of  marketing  at  Vessyl, said that the product's appearance on 'The Colbert Report' led to a bump in sales and inspired many to defend the product.

Pour a beer into Vessyl, and an LED display on the side lights up. 'Beer,' it pulses, reassuringly, in case there were any doubt. Vessyl's  selling  point  is  that,  by  tracking everything you drink, it can tell you exactly how many liquid calories you consume in a day, as well as how much caffeine. It can also determine your level of hydration.

'I know of no sentient being above the age of 4 who has any problem knowing when they're  thirsty-it's  just  not  an  issue  that needs  to  be  addressed,'  says  Todd  Lemmon, a creative director at an advertising firm in Nashville who, along with his friend Tom Cullen, a comedy writer in Los Angeles,  has  created  the  Internet's  definitive chronicle  of  the  current  'revolution'  in smart gadgets.

The tagline for their site, 'We put a chip in it,' perfectly describes the impulse that has overtaken so many entrepreneurs and hard- ware  startups:  'It  was  just  a  dumb  thing. Then we put a chip in it. Now it's a smart thing.'

Many of the objects on the site seemed so ridiculous that I had to find out what their creators were thinking. Rahul Baxi, creator of SmartyPans, which has received an undisclosed round of seed financing, says the idea for a smart frying pan came from his inability  to  cook.  Being  an  engineer,  Mr. Baxi  decided  that  given  the  choice  between taking cooking classes and launching a startup to create a pan that would tell him how to cook through an app, the latter was more expeditious.

Humberto  Evans,  founder  of  Pantelligent, also is making a smart pan. (A general rule of connected-object startups is that where there is one, there are many.) Mr. Evans's pan  is  further  along-he  is  already  at  the manufacturing  stage-and  does  one  thing that is genuinely useful. It can tell you the precise temperature of the pan. But rather than providing a readout in, say, the handle of the pan, Pantelligent's pan can only tell you through your smartphone, to which it connects wirelessly.

'I think Pantelligent has the capability to be way more than a product,' says Mr. Evans. 'What we're really taking is the knowledge of  how  people  know  how  to  cook  and delivering  it  through  a  pan.  You  have  to put the chip in it for a reason.'

Of  all  the  startups  I  talked  to,  Mr.  Evans made  the  best  case  for  his  smart  gadget, which can do things like tell you how long to cook your salmon based on its thickness. But I also found the logic of nearly all of these  startups-that  their  first  connected object  was  just  the  start  of  something bigger, an entire 'ecosystem' of connected objects-to be informed more by their ambition than the needs of the consumer.

Anthony Ortiz, the man behind the world's first smart plate, insists that plates are just

the beginning. What about fans of soup? I asked him. 'If you're going to make soup, that's not what we do,' says Mr. Ortiz. 'That would be something that goes in a bowl…. The bowl is something that could be on the strategic horizon for us.'

No one I talked to seemed to fully appreciate  the  additional  complexity  they  might be introducing into their users' lives. Do I really  want to check a bar-graph infested dashboard  of  my  weekly  eating  activity, which  is  a  'feature'  of  the  world's  first smart fork? And what about the fact that every smart object I add to my life means one more device to keep charged?

One thing smart objects are definitely good for  is  surveillance  of  their  users.  Samy Liechti,  founder  of  sock  subscription  service Blacksocks, and also the man behind the  world's  first  smart  socks,  told  me  his line of Internet-connected socks had changed the way he segments and markets to his customers. 'If we do market research, we have to ask people what they do,' says Mr.  Liechti.  But  now,  'we  know  exactly what they do, and that's a huge difference.'

I have little doubt that there is a market for these objects. Vessyl, for example, already has more than a million dollars' worth of pre-orders  from  155  countries,  says  Mr. Barnes.  But  I  have  serious  doubts  about how  loyal  those  customers  and  investors will be once these products are delivered. How many gadgets of any sort live up to promises made in their promotional videos?

That said, I don't think the eventual failure of the majority of these startups portends anything for the rest of the tech industry, other than the freeing up of talented engineers who have experience making things like trackers for when you break wind.
