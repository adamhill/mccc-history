## The Future of Amiga: 3 Visions

The Amiga 30th Anniversary train chugs along a little further. October 10th marks the event in Dusseldorf, Germany

(http://www.amiga30.de)  and  October 15-18 has the returning AmiWest  show  in  Sacramento,  CA.  My own efforts at putting out an anniversary animation continue, though I'm feeling a bit shaky about getting  it  finished  before  the  Amiga's  30th  year  is  actually  the  31st. I'll have a thing or two to show for the meeting regardless.

After catching various pieces of discussion on different Amiga and related boards, there seem to be a few primary  opinions  on  what  Amiga can, or should be. Actually, it's more like a spectrum of possibilities, but it's not difficult to boil it down to a few basic positions. On one end of the  spectrum  are  the  people  who are happy with the Amiga more or less as it is, or around where it was when  Commodore  went  bust  in 1994,  if  not  earlier.  These  people are mainly interested in retro-gaming and using the classic period software, and not particularly concerned with anything more than that-they have other systems to  handle  their  'modern'  needs. The  usual  options  for  their  goals include maintaining the classic Amiga  hardware,  emulation  on  other systems,  or  newer  recreations  of

the older hardware such as the Minimig  and  related  machines.  The original  hardware  might  be  problematic  to  use  with  new  HD  monitors or televisions, which emulation  or  updated  hardware can address, though some may prefer  to  use  an  old  CRT  monitor  for the full retro experience.

The next step is to embrace the benefits of newer computer hardware and updated operating systems and software,  but  trying  to  maintain  a reasonable  level  of  compatibility with  the  original  Amiga  software applications.  These  are  best  represented  by  systems  running  Amiga OS4 and MorphOS, which both offer modern (yet Amiga-like) operating system experiences on fast PowerPC-based  hardware  and  powerful video cards, running both software written to the new systems' strengths as well as 'legacy' Amiga software  which  does  not  require legacy Amiga hardware to function. The discontinued Amithlon software  did  much  the  same  on  Intelbased computers, using the classic Amiga OS. There have been a couple attempts to make updated machines allowing hardware compatibility too, but they have been mostly non-starters. For many, these  systems  represent  the  best balance between old and new, but they  do  have  their  shortcomings. The  top  end  of  available  PowerPC hardware  is  being  reached,  which will  eventually  force  the  OS  developers  to  move  to  a  different  hardware  line  eventually,  or  stagnate. Also holding them back is the Amiga software compatibility itself. As the

original Amiga system was designed at times when the machines we  use  today  were  barely  conceived  as  possible,  it  is  between difficult and impossible to support massive amounts of RAM or memory  protection  for  better  stability without  the  support  for  the  old breaking down, which leads us to…

On the far end of the Amiga spectrum are those who like the Amiga more as a concept than a tangible reality.  When  told  that  adding  a feature to the OS will require classic  compatibility  to  be  dropped, they  advocate  dropping  it  in  the name of progress. While there isn't really  a  system  to  exactly  match this  philosophy,  AROS,  the  opensource Amiga-based Operating system does on a base level, as it can be ported to nearly any hardware, and  only  directly  supports  software written to run  on  AROS. There  are  other  niche  operating systems  and  distributions  of  the Linux OS that take inspiration from the Amiga in varying degrees. The obvious  benefit  is  with  nothing holding it back, the system can incorporate  whatever  features  are required or desired, and make use of whatever hardware capabilities it needs. The downside is, of course, the lack of direct support for older Amiga software (though emulation or  other  abstraction  is  still  possible), requiring new applications to be  written  or  ported,  which  has proven to be less than forthcoming historically. In such a hypothetical situation,  one  wonders  on  a  conceptual  level  at  what  point  the 'Amiga-ness' ends.

- Who  knows,  it  all  might  become moot when phones, tablets, speech terfaces change the paradigm and a
- interfaces, or holographic brain in'computer' is unrecognizable to the people of today. All I know is when that happens, someone will probably  try  to  get  it  to  run  an  Amiga application or game. It might even be me.

## A New Classic Amiga Mouse

A-EON Technology Ltd is pleased to announce a new  Classic  Amiga mouse is now available.

As part of A-EON's ongoing commitment  to  Classic  Amiga  users,  we have  teamed  up  with  Elbox  Computer  to  produce  a  new  optical 1000 DPI modern mouse.

If  you  are  always  finding  that  the Commodore original mouse needs cleaning  and  operates  unreliably, then this mouse will provide a quality replacement on your Amiga.

- optical  (no  ball  and  no  cleaning!)
- 1000 DPI resolution
- microswitched buttons
- compatible  with  A500,  A500+, A600*,  A1200,  A1500,  A2000, A3000, A4000, A4000T.
- scrollwheel  and  tilt  functions can  be  mapped  in  Freewheel software
*  Optional  adapter  is  required  for A600 use available here (http://amigakit.leamancomputing .com/catalog/product\_info.php?pr oducts\_id=1245).
