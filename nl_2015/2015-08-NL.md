## Looking Back

It's  another  month  in  the  Amiga sphere, and it's a time when Amiga users are focused more on the past than the future. July is when a number of different celebrations of the Amiga's  30th  anniversary  take  (or have taken) place. The end of June gave us a celebration in Amsterdam, with several Amiga luminaries giving talks. Videos from the event can be found on YouTube by searching for 'Amiga30.eu.' On the 4th of July, there was an English 30th anniversary  gathering  in  Stratford-upon Avon. The US will have its big 30th event on the 25th and 26th at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View California. You can check  out  info  on  the  event  and even purchase tickets (or just make a  donation)  through  their  website at http://amiga30.com. I'd be there myself if I could have managed the journey, but I'm unable. I hope everyone  who  can  go  has  the  drive and  opportunity  to  actually  do  so. I'll  be  eagerly  awaiting  news  and info from the show.

My 30th Anniversary Amiga animation project plows forward, however  slowly.  I  would  probably  be satisfied if I can finish it before the year  is  completely  over,  though  I hope  to  do  better  than  that.  Like many of these projects, I spend almost  as  much  time  learning  new things  about  old  software  as  I  do actually working or producing, trying to push my 3D software and my own  skills  further  than  I  have  be-

fore. I hope to show a thing or two at the meeting.

While not all the Amiga anniversary events are held in July, the month is the focal point for most anniversaries as it was the time of the official launch of the original Commodore Amiga system in 1985, which would retroactively be known as the Amiga  1000  when  more  models  appeared later. The launch was a big, almost  Steve  Jobs-ian  level  event, featuring, among other things, famed artist Andy Warhol fiddling with an early grade paint package. You might remember a small news story some time back regarding the discovery of 'Warhol's floppy discs' and the incredible effort and expertise  that  went  into  recovering  the images from them. I seriously hope all that work applied to recovering data  corrupted  by  age,  or  dealing with early software that may have predated  the  file  standards  we're used to, because I would be seriously  disappointed  if  it  was  just  that people were just too dim to think to put an Amiga disk in an Amiga drive.

Like many tech products, some aspects of the Amiga were rushed and corners cut to make a release date. Unfortunately  for  Amiga,  that  was the software and operating system. Early  plans  were  to  have  a  more UNIX-like  OS  with  resource  and memory  tracking  for  stability  in multitasking, but that would not be ready  in  time  for  the  hardware's planned release. Instead, a different multitasking OS called TRIPOS was adapted,  which  could  be  finished up quicker. Even so, not everything

was  finished  or  polished  enough for  prime  time,  so  instead  of  putting the OS in ROM, a small section of  the  A1000's  memory  was  dedicated to OS ROM code loaded from a 'Kickstart' floppy disk. This early beta-level  operating  system,  combined  with  the  new  challenges  of writing software for a preemptive multitasking operating system (one that  put  the  burden  of  keeping track of RAM and other resources on the programmer more than the  system),  the  Amiga  got  a  notundeserved  reputation  for  being flaky and unstable, which followed it past the point where updates put its actual stability about as good if not better than Mac and DOS/Windows systems of the time. Even so, the seeds of those cut corners of the mid-eighties can bloom even today, where a bad program can force a reboot even on modern OS4 or MorphOS systems that need to  follow  old  Amiga  paradigms to maintain software compatibility.

People with a poor sense of history don't  find  the  Amiga  very  impressive  today.  After  all,  pretty  much any garden variety desktop or mobile device today can easily outperform an Amiga, even emulate one, and those people often mis-remember  the  past  of  PCs  and  Macs  as being  pretty  much  the  same  as they are now, just slower and maybe with lower resolution or detail level. What they don't get is, going back  to  the  window  of  the  late 'eighties  and  early  'nineties,  the Amiga was the only true machine that  displayed  full-color  graphics with quality similar to photo- graphs  and  video,  moved  them around the screen nimbly, and put them all  together  with  sound  and music of similar quality, all accessible  and  affordable  to  the  average consumer. When properly taken advantage of, it played excellent games too, thanks to its early conceptualization as a game console/computer  hybrid.  It  did this  thanks  largely  to  its  custom co-processors, which could operate independently of the main CPU for better overall performance. This basic idea would later be co-opted by the  PCs  and  Macs  with  their  modern high-powered 3D video cards.

The Amiga could also be considered a pioneer in a less positive, though still heavily influential area. A couple of the 'killer apps' for the early Amiga were the games 'Defender of the  Crown'  by  Cinemaware,  and 'Shadow of the Beast' by Psygnosis. These  games  were  praised  highly for their impressive visuals and audio that really showed of the power and advantages that the Amiga had over its contemporaries of the day. Also,  neither  of  those  games  were considered  very  good  to  actually play,  excellent  examples  of  flash over substance. Still, many wanted the games for the visual showcases they  are,  regardless.  While  they were not Amiga-exclusive, 'Defender of the Crown' and Cinemaware's other titles were pioneers in what they  liked  to  call  'interactive  fiction,' in the line of interactive movies  or  television  like  earlier  text adventures could be seen as interactive  books.  The  'game'  part  of Cinemaware games was often thin, set pieces to hang the narrative and visuals upon. The audiovisual power of the Amiga was well-suited to this form of gaming just as well as it  was  to  the  fast-action  arcading. So the next time you might be gaming on your X-stations or Play-boxes, and annoyed about some game with fantastic visuals but lackluster gameplay, or something that amounts  to  an  extended  movie with  occasional  breaks  for  you  to press some buttons, you can thank the Amiga for those too.

## Pi-Boy Classic

We've  seen  all kinds  of  portable  retro  game consoles over the years,  but Thingiverse user Jooxoe3i's project  manages  to  make  the smallest  device we've  seen  yet using a Raspberry Pi.

Unlike other projects, this one actually  breaks  apart  the  screen  and controller so you can stuff it inside a smaller case. The upper half is the screen and Raspberry Pi while the lower  half  is  the  controller.  You'll need a Raspberry Pi and some intermediate-level soldering skills to get this project done, but it's not terribly difficult. You'll also need to 3D print the case, but thankfully there are all sorts of places that'll do that for you. You'll find all the parts you need  and  a  basic  guide  over  on Thingiverse.
