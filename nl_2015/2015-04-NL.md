## Amiga Graphics Explained

There  have  been  a  number  of  updates and developments in the Amiga  sphere,  but  perhaps  the  biggest news of recent is the fact that 2015 marks  the  30th  anniversary  of  the official  launch  of  the  original  Commodore  Amiga  1000  computer  system, in all its Mitchie's-paw-print-inside-the-case glory. A celebration event is planned at the Computer History Museum in Mountain  View,  California,  on  July 25th  and  26th.  A  Kickstarter  campaign  has  been  set  up  to  fund  the event, so anyone looking to contribute can look here:

I have spoken on the subject of Amiga technology in the past, and how the  technological  strengths  of  one time can be the weaknesses of another.  Reading  the  book  'The  Future Was Here' by Jimmy Maher, with its in-depth and honest examination of the workings and history of the Amiga  system,  has  given  me  a  better understanding  of  the  reasoning  behind certain design decisions. Amiga users and CG people in general are probably familiar with 'bit-planes' making  up  a  graphics  display,  and may  have  heard  about  the  debate regarding  'planar'  vs.  'chunky'  pixels, and how they relate to graphics performance.  For  those  not  in  the know,  the  more  bitplanes  on  a  display,  the  more  possible  colors,  dou-

bling with each bit per pixel added. Meanwhile, most computers operate in bytes, 8 bits in a chunk (or 16, or 32,  or….)  This  means  two  possible ways of handling the display, putting a  single  byte  for  each  pixel's  bitplanes, (the 'chunky' way) or spreading that byte across eight adjoining pixels,  giving  1  bit  to  each,  with  a different byte handling the next bitplane  for  those  pixels,  and  so  on. This is 'planar' graphics, and the way a stock Amiga handles things, building a display layer by layer. Chunky graphics  are  much  easier  to  understand, as it basically amounts to plugging one value into one pixel. So why did the Amiga take a seemingly more convoluted approach? It came down to efficient use of memory. The original Amiga only had the power to use 6-bits per pixel, and could only use 32  user-defined  colors  (five  bits.  It doesn't  sound  like  much  now,  but that was better than that vast majority of home  systems  available in 1985). Using a full 8-bit byte for each pixel would mean at least a quarter of  those  bits  would  be  unused  and therefore  wasted.  If  fewer  bitplanes were needed, that waste is magnified. Smearing those bits across the planes  means  the  least  amount  of memory is wasted, which was good for a system that shared video memory and system memory for common usage  (another cost-saving decision).

The planar graphics approach would prove to have other advantages, once discovered. Having each bitplane handled separately in memory means the system can shuffle them around like cards,  for  visual  effects or things like parallax scrolling,

where overlapping graphic elements can be moved at different speeds for a  pseudo-3D  effect.  Another  thing that probably couldn't be done without a planar display would become part  of  the  Amiga's  claim-to-fame. While the original system only had 5 bits  worth  of  colors  in  the  palette, the  Amiga  display  could  use  six. One way this was used was the 'halfbright' mode (in later Amiga models than the A1000) which took the 32 colors of 5 bits and used the sixth to cut  the  brightness  of  that  pixel  in half  if  active,  like  a  sunglass  lens. The true star was the Hold-and-Modify,  or  HAM  graphic  mode,  which took bitplanes to a new level. HAM mode took two out of the six  bitsper-pixel, and turned them into control information for how the remaining four are used, as either one of sixteen set palette colors, or by modifying the red, green, or blue component of the pixel immediately to the left to make a new color. This mode made  it  possible  for  the  Amiga  to display its complete possible palette of 4,096 colors, or 12 bits worth of color information, on-screen at once using  only  6  bits  worth  of  data,  at the  expense  of  'fringes'  or  minor color  artifacts  in  the  displayed  image. It was essentially a form of lossy image compression well before formats like JPEG came into common use.

Despite the upsides to a planar display, there was still the one obvious downside.  While  the  chunky  style display is easier to explain, as seen above, it's also easier for the average computer  to  do.  Where  a  single chunky pixel needs only to be writ-

ten once to a single byte of memory, a planar pixel needs as many memory  writes  as  there  are  bitplanes  behind  it,  up  to  six,  or  eight  for  the later  AGA  chipset  Amigas,  which takes  more  time.  Where  this  difference is usually trivial at the speeds a computer operates, especially an Amiga  with  hardware  designed  to shuffle around video and graphics at high  speed,  it  makes  a  difference when  lots  of  pixels  are  changed around in a short time, like a whole screen's  worth.  This  became  most apparent  with  the  rise  of  3D  video games  like  DOOM.  The  amount  of computing  required  to  calculate  a 3D  viewpoint  like  that  for  every frame is very heavy, but adding on steps to buffer the display and write to the screen in bitplanes packs on the time and slows down the frame rate.  It  was  around  this  time  when the  DOS  and  Windows  PCs,  which concentrated more on raw horsepower  with  large  amounts  of  memory and storage, took the advantage with these  types  of  games,  and  planar displays started looking more like a detriment. The Amiga CD-32 game console  tried  to  address  this  shortcoming  with a new  chip called 'Akiko' which tried to speed up the conversion between chunky and planar  graphics  for  3D  gaming,  but  it

was too little, too late, as few developers  bothered  with  it,  and  Commodore went down in 1994, taking the CD-32 with it.

The  Amiga  as  a  whole  didn't  go down nearly so easily, and many of the users of more professional-grade machines  would  outfit  them  with new video cards, using chips in common with those from Windows systems… 'chunky' ones with dedicated banks of video-only memory. While these video cards were unable to use the tricks of the Amiga's native video chips, they were usually faster, given enough  CPU  horsepower,  and  offered higher screen resolutions and color  depths  of  16,  24,  or  32  bitplanes,  which  would  undoubtedly overwhelm a system that would have needed to write each plane individually.  The new cards required driver software, such as Picasso96 or CybergrafX, to act as a layer between the Amiga system and the hardware, allowing well-behaved Amiga software to use a video card display as easily as a native Amiga chip display, with chunky or planar issues only a matter of the speed of the screen. Unfortunately,  older  software  or  things that get their speed and efficiency by programming directly to the Amiga hardware,  like  games,  can't  be  pro-

moted  to  a  video  card  display  as simply, and the new hardware wouldn't be able to understand HAM graphics or bitplane effects anyway. Newer  Amiga-related  systems  running OS4 or MorphOS or AROS use modern versions of the old PC video cards, so the 'chunkies' have officially  won,  because  the  old  memory prices  which  prompted  more  efficient ways to make use of it are no longer  a  concern,  at  least  nowhere near a level as seen in the mid 1980s.

## 5 Sad Facts About America's Slow Internet

Anyone who's ever stared glass-eyed at a Netflix video that won't load or stuttered  through  a  glitchy  Skype call  knows  that  the  United  States leaves its citizens starving for bandwidth. But the latest data in Akamai's annual 'State of the Internet' report

presents some pretty depressing statistics  about  America's  slow,  shitty internet. 16.4 -5.6%

In case you're not familiar, Akamai is a cloud services company that counts giants  like  Apple,  Facebook, and  Twitter  as  clients.  Those  relationships  yield  data  about  internet traffic  all  over  the  world,  including the details  of  connection  speeds, cyber-attacks,  and  network  penetration. The latest report tells a tale of how far behind the US is in terms of upgrading  infrastructure  and  ensuring  internet  faster  speeds.  And  the US invented the damn thing.

If  you  want  fast  internet,  you'd  be better  off  moving  to  Latvia  than settling down in middle America. Or South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Sweden,  Switzerland,  the  Netherlands, Ireland, Czech Republic, or Finland. The  US  isn't  even  in  the  top  10 countries  with  the  fastest  average connection speeds worldwide.

The  top  slots  this  year,  yet  again, belong to Asia. South Korea's internet is probably the best in the world. It  ranks  at  the  top  of  every  list, namely  the  list  of  countries  with average broadband speeds above 10 Mbps.  A  rollicking  79  percent  of South  Koreans  enjoy  speeds  of  10 Mbps or greater. The US didn't even make the list.

A lot of people blame slow US internet speeds on the size of the country. The internet does demand a physical infrastructure  to  carry  packets  of data from one side of the nation to another, and in more isolated areas, that  infrastructure  is  more  sparse, making  it tougher to offer  high speed connections. It means that the whole country's average speed gets brought down by these dead spots.

In  fact,  Akamai  only  mentions  the US in this part of the report to note that broadband adoption had dipped slightly  (a  'negligible  0.3  percent drop') and to point out that 'in the United States, 50 million people-or

But  the  data  tell  a  different  story. Ironically, some of the most remote states in the country enjoy some of the  fastest  internet  speeds.  Utah's internet is number six in the nation,

Uncompetitive internet speeds is hardly news to US officials. Acknowledging the massive gaps in access to high-speed internet across the country, the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) recently redefined broadband in an effort to compel internet service providers to build faster networks. It used to be 4 Mbps. Now it's 25 Mbps.

Guess what? Not a single state can boast  anything  close  to  widespread speeds greater than 25 Mbps. In fact, none  of  them  can  even  claim  full broadband  coverage  according  to the old definition.

So if you want to move to a state with pretty good internet, Delaware is the state for you. It's also a great place to incorporate a tech company.

So  all  the  above  statistics  refer  to terrestrial broadband. Surely, the US must be better on the mobile front? Nope. Akamai's findings for the fastest  mobile  connections  in  the  five major continental regions, ranked:

- Asia Pacific: Japan, 8.3 Mbps

Venezuela's  mobile  internet  speeds are  almost  twice  those  of  the  US. Venezuela  is  struggling  to  feed  its citizens,  but  they  can  stream  YouTube on their phones faster than the average American.

Nevertheless, the US is second only to  China as the biggest exporter of attack  traffic.  This  isn't  necessarily related  to  speed,  and  it's  hard  to draw conclusions from Akamai's data  about  internet  security.  But  one thing  stands  out:  A  sizable  proportion of cyberattacks worldwide originate in the US.

North Dakota

China  accounts  for  41  percent  of global  attack  traffic,  while  the  US accounts for just 13 percent. There's not really a third place. Taiwan and Russia  are  neck-and-neck  with  4.4 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. The report doesn't offer much detail about  the  attacks  themselves,  but the data doesn't lie. If you wanted to pick the top two belligerents in the ongoing global cyberwar, they would be China and the straggling United States.
