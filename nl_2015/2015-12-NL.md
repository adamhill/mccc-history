## Curiosity to Explore Martian Dunes

A mix of rock and sand greeted the Curiosity  Rover  as  it  approaches the  Bagnold  Dune  field,  the  dunes slowly  encroaching  on  weathered outcrops.  This  is  our  first  visit  to active dunes anywhere but on Earth.

Curiosity is currently taking photos as it inches closer and closer to the dark  sands  of  the  Bagnold  Dunes. Once it reaches its target dune, it'll use its scoop to collect a sample for analysis,  and  sideswipe  the  sand with a wheel to scuff a fresh surface to ogle the dune's interior.

The position of the Curiosity Rover is marked on the satellite image below, near the center. [Editor's Note: Check on-line for the images. There is  too  much  detail  to  show  clearly here.] Interestingly, none of the outcrops share the distinct dark colour that would indicate an easy source for freshly-eroding sediment.

The  dark  Bagnold  Dunes  are  composed at  least  in  part  of  olivine,  a mineral  common  to  dark  volcanic rocks (basalt). Researchers are hoping  Curiosity  will  be  able  to  determine if the wind is sorting minerals, separating heavier olivine from other minerals.

The Bagnold Dunes are active: satellite  images  reveal  them  creeping about  a  meter  (3  feet)  per  year. This is our first up-close look at Martian sand dunes, in contrast to sand ripples and drifts. Unlike ripples or drifts, dunes have enough sand that the  windblow  sediments  can  slide down the steep downwind face.

The texture of Martian dunes is different than here on Earth. Mission

planner  for  the  dune  expedition Nathan Bridges explains:

'The ripples on them are much larger than ripples on top of dunes on Earth, and we don't know why. We have  models  based  on  the  lower air pressure. It takes a higher wind speed to get a particle moving. But now we'll have the first opportunity to make detailed observations.' Curiosity  Rover  Eases  Into  First Exploration of Martian Dunes

Interesting  geological  features  in this area will be named for Nambian geological place names in a tribute  to  the  Namib  Desert  that  has offered such an excellent terrestrial  analogue  for  interpreting  Martian dunes and playas.

## Space Elevator May Be Built of Diamond

If the notion that humans will one day ascend into orbit on a rope of ultra strong carbon nanofibers sounds a bit out of this world, then you're going to love the latest dazzling twist: our future space eleva- tors might actually be built of diamond.

Graphene  may  be  the  hottest  substance  in  materials  science  right now,  but  over  the  past  year,  the scientific  community  has  worked itself into a tizzy over another carbon-based  wonder  material:  diamond nanothreads, one-dimensional carbon crystals that  are  as  strong  as,  well,  a  diamond.

Now,  to  be  fair,  we're  not  totally sure diamond nanothreads deserve the attention they're getting they've only been produced by one lab  at  Penn  State  University,  and it's not clear how easy it's going  to  be  to mass produce these brilliant fibers. There's also concern that diamond nanothreads will  become  increasingly  brittle  as  they  get longer, which would probably put a 62,000 foot diamond space cable  out  of  the question.

But a recent modeling study from a team  at  Queensland  University  of Technology  shows  that  when  molecular defects are inserted into the otherwise  repetitive  benzene  ring structure of a diamond nanothread, the  fiber  becomes  highly  ductile. With the right molecular design, the researchers  suggest  that  diamond nanothreads could be 'ideal for the creation of extremely strong threedimensional nano-architectures.'

If  the  new  models  turn  out  to  be correct, this material could have a bright future in all sorts of applications, from nanotechnology to electronics  to  yes,  maybe  even  space elevators.  Diamonds  in  the  sky? Still  a  fantasy,  Rihanna.  Diamonds transporting us to the sky? A long shot, but we'll keep an open mind.
