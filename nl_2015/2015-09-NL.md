## Amiga: Ahead of Its Time

As most of us know by now, the Amiga just had its official thirtieth anniversary last month. Along with the animation  project  I'm  working  on (and  might  actually  finish  before the year is over), I've had some fun going through some of my earliest Amiga  graphics,  and  posted  them around a few places for the anniversary,  along  with  this  write-up  for the uninitiated:

Roughly  thirty  years  ago,  the  first Amiga  computer  system  was  released to the world by Commodore. It was rough around the edges in a lot of ways initially, but a stunning achievement regardless. Many people  nowadays  short-sell  the  Amiga's importance in the grand scheme  of  computer  things,  perhaps  out  of  ignorance.  It's  easy when pretty much everything that made Amiga special back in the day is  easily  surpassed  by  the  most modest of today's hardware now. In the  mid-1980s  however,  it  was  a different  story.  Where  Apple's  Macintosh  popularized  graphic  interfaces and ease-of-use, and IBM's PC brought the modular design philosophy that helped it rule the world through its  clones,  the  Amiga  was the  first  consumer-level  multitasking multimedia machine. While text-only,  monochrome,  or  basic color  displays  were  the  norm  for home systems thirty years ago, the Amiga offered full color graphics in several different screen resolutions,

some approaching photographic (or  at  least  VHS  video)  quality.  It also had four-channel stereo sound capable  of  playing  digital  samples to go with those graphics. This power  was  thanks  to  a  trio  of  custom co-processors, which could operate independently of the main CPU, doing the audiovisual grunt  work while  the  system  is  doing  other things, enabling zippy performance for full-screen animation or heavyduty gaming (by 1980s-1990s standards at least). This was a vast expansion of the kind of multimedia power offered by earlier 8-bit systems by Commodore and Atari, and like them, the Amiga hardware was conceived to potentially double as a high-spec game console as well as a computer system. Perhaps for this reason (or just to allow users to use their  own TVs instead of buying a monitor),  the  Amiga  was  good  at syncing  up  with  analog  video  signals, and mixing its own graphics or animation with it. Where the Apple Mac is said to have pioneered 'desktop  publishing,'  the  Amiga  almost single-handedly created the field of desktop video, and soon amateurs and  public-access  stations  across the  globe  were  using  Amigas  for video graphics, titles,  and  more. The field reached its apex with the 'Video Toaster' by Newtek, a hardware  and  software  bundle  which, when  combined  with  an  Amiga 2000  and  some  video  equipment, could  do  the  job  of  video  mixing gear that cost tens of thousands of dollars  worth  of  pro  video  editing gear.

An  even  longer-enduring  legacy would  be  the  Amiga's  operating system,  which  almost  from  the start offered full preemptive multitasking formerly the exclusive domain  of UNIX  and  institutional systems, and would take close to a decade  before  Windows  and  Mac could  do  the  same.  Even  with  its pedigree  and  power,  the  Amiga couldn't  hold  back  the  Windows PC steamroller in the long run, and pretty much every desktop, laptop, and mobile system today has strong,  fast  multimedia  power  using video co-processors that operate independently, and preemptive multitasking operating systems. It would be foolish to say those things  wouldn't  have  come  about in  consumer  computer  systems without  the  Amiga,  but  I  like  to believe it was the kick in the pants to spur the market along quicker.

Occasionally  I  think  about  what makes  Amiga  systems  (and  ones like  them)  special  and  desirable, even in this day and age when nearly everything from a high-powered desktop machine to a phone is capable of multimedia presentations and multitasking. There are still a few things out there that the Amiga did that other systems still apparently struggle with, whether by design philosophy or something else. The Amiga OS was known for having a small 'footprint' in terms of memory  and  drive  space,  though that was partly because it is not as heavily featured as other operating systems that continued developing and growing for decades after Commodore  went  bust.  Still,  there  is something to be said for a system that doesn't constantly access an on-disk swap file or virtual memory, even when  gigabytes  are  supposed  to  be  available.  I  also appreciate that using most Amigas and Amiga-likes is a consistent user experience. If you hit a key or click a button on the screen, you can be reasonably sure it's going to behave the same and take the same amount of time to happen as it did the last several times you did it, and if not, you know it's something out of the ordinary. Go to another OS, and there are all these strange little  pauses and delays for no obvious reason. If the system is a few years old, it's even worse as all the little files  build  up  like  dust.  While  a  ten-year-old  Amiga may not be as zippy  as  a  new  one,  the  difference  is nowhere  near  as  great  as  the  performance  gap  between old and new (but otherwise identical) Mac or Windows or Linux machines. I suppose it's little wonder they recommend system cleanings or de-fragging or total re-installations as often as they do.

Finally-and this is more a biased than an actual shortcoming-I like that Amiga is not afraid to devote a full screen  to  an  application,  where  other  operating  systems prefer to put windows up on the main desktop. I prefer  the  option  of  flipping  through  screens  myself for speed and convenience. The mobile devices are the one  thing  that  handles  its  apps  similarly,  largely  because the smaller touch screens made the paradigms of  Windows  desktops  inconvenient.  (And now Microsoft needs to figure out the opposite is also true.)

While the world has mostly moved on from thirty years ago when the Amiga taught the consumer computer market how to really do things,  I  believe  there  is  still  a  thing  or  two left for the Amiga to teach, if anyone out there is able to listen anymore.

## A Look At Computing Power

As  some  of  you  may  know,  I  worked  in  Information Technology  for  some  time.  When  I  entered  the  field, the  most  powerful  computer  in  the  world  was  the Cray-1 Supercomputer. Things have progressed quite a  bit  since  then.  I  thought  it  would  be  interesting  to compare computing power back then to what we carry in  our  pockets  these  days,  so  I  did  a  little  research. You'll find the results in the table below. Check it out.
