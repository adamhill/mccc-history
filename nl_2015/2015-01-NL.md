## A-EON Is The News

The holidays approach, and the year draws to a close. We don't even  have  a  fun  doomsday scenario to play with like we did in 1999 or 2012.

In the world of Amiga, it seems a lot  of  the  news  focuses  on A-EON Technology in one way or another.  Presumably  to  bring more attention to the Amiga OS4 systems, A-EON has been buying up source and development rights to software packages. Personal Paint was one, and a new version (7.3)  with  some  additions  and enhancements has already been released for OS4 and 68K Amiga systems (OS3), though one could argue the biggest enhancement was reworking the software to a more easily portable code base. It is  available  for  sale/download from  AmiStore  and www.ppaint.com.  I  use  the previous 7.1 version of Ppaint quite a lot still, as it is a capable 8-bit  256-color  pixel-slinging program in the style of the old Deluxe Paint, and I am interested in new versions, especially if it's possible  to  have  them  work flawlessly on my MorphOS system (7.1 on MorphOS runs, but is charitably described as 'quirky'). So far I have heard mixed reports on the new 7.3 version, so I'm not yet in a hurry to spend for the update.  The  price  isn't  bad

(roughly $25), and I will probably get it when disposable income is available, even if only to run on my 68K system, which is there for the  previous  Personal  Paint currently.

Next in the A-EON shopping list is Aladdin 4D, a long also-ran in the Amiga 3D render software biz. For a long time attempts were made to develop Aladdin 4D by DiscreetFX and the developer of Pagestream, with little success. Perhaps  the developer/programmer resources A-EON has access to will yield better  results.  I've  never  been much for Aladdin 4D back in the old days, preferring Sculpt, then Imagine, then Lightwave, but new developments  in  any  Amiga software that is more than a small utility will always be welcome.

Since  A-EON  is  a  current producer  of  Amiga  hardware running OS4, it's understandably in their interest to support the building of a software base to improve  the  fortunes  of  their systems. Where the uncertainty lies is what goes for people like me who threw their lot in behind the MorphOS system, or AROS, or whatever else. Since A-EON purchased the rights, would they allow the creation of a Morph or AROS port of software, perhaps even  create  it  themselves?  Or would they  actively  block  any initiatives for Morph/AROS ports, even  if  they  could  potentially profit  from  sales  or  royalties, because they are not part of their hardware/OS plan? At this point it's an unknown quantity, though I  believe  that  the  business marketplace  is  sparse  and scattered enough that one OS camp is not a serious impact on another, where multiple options might  offer  multiple  (small) revenue streams. Only time will tell the true motives of A-EON, especially if they manage to buy up  more  Amiga  software packages. Personally, I would like to see a native MorphOS port of my standby graphics software Photogenics.

## A-EON and More

A-EON Technology would seem to be out to become the new Amiga  Inc.  In  ownership  of things  and  not  in  practices though.  Already  owning  the AmiApp shop and Amiga.org they  have  now  acquired  the Amiga (68K and PPC) side to Aladdin4D.  This  not  only includes AmigaOS but MorphOS and  AROS  ports  as  well. DiscreetFX still has the rights to non-Amiga ports at this time.

This next item I have mentioned before  for  an  earlier  version. AmiKitReal is now at version 8.0

and it is still a free download. This is  for  those  of  us  still  with  an Amiga or emulation. This is not to be confused with AmiKit8 which is  made  to  run  on  multiple platforms. AmiKitReal is based on AmiKit8 but it's an unofficial port of it. One of the bigger additions to this version is that MUI4 is used although you can revert to 3.8 if you need. EasyNet Pro is also now available. If you have the original you can update for a lower price. The cost is about $31.33 through Amikit. It supports quite a few SANA-II network devices. I may end up getting  it  if  I  can't  get Miami to use the USB/Ethernet device I'm going to get my A1200. If you have the Amistore app you can download it, however without this you will need to wait for them to ship a CD with it.

In the MorphOS camp we have a beginning feature for Calimero 0.4: A Powerpoint (.ppt) loader. This is still in development but they seem to be making quite a few updates rather  quickly  for  it.  I'm  still reading up on a few other items such as a new item called Romboot 44.4. It would seem to just be a new module but I'm unclear as to what exactly it is as they only point to a Youtube video that shows a different kickstart screen. I'll share what I can find out later on it.

Another  year  has  passed.  The group is still going but does seem smaller then ever. I've likely got more OSs in my home than any would  have  believed  of  this 'Amiga Snob.' The A1200 with Amiga  3.9,  Pegasos  II  with MorphOS 3.7 an old A2000 even with AmigaOS 2.0 I think… There is the Win 7 Pro 64 Monster (But even that has Amiga Forever and soon AmiKit8 if I can figure it out. 2 MacMini G4s I may try selling soon and a Dual G5 Powermac. Once I get MorphOS to the Dual G5 Powermac, I will be happier still but that will take time because of funding for some time, sadly. While I have Windoze and older MacOS the Pegasos II and A1200 are still dear. The Pegasos II is still my primary system and I'm still working on the A1200 to improve it as well. I'll have a SATA drive on the Pegasos II soon and a larger IDE on the Amiga as well (I might be looking into a way to add SATA to the A1200 as well) so space will not be an issue anymore. I even found 128M SIMMs that I could use to raise the RAM to 256M on her as well….While I and many of us use other platforms, it's good to know there are those that still care for this elegant and lovely system. I constantly  get  bashed  for  this mode of thinking. Many of even our group say that things are dead, but  as  long  as  my  Amigas  are

Take care, stay warm and be safe.

## Editor's Note

My apologies for the lack of a December newsletter. I was in the midst of a move into a new home and it was quite some time before I was even able to get my computer up and running again. The move took  place  the  week  of Thanksgiving (we had a frozen pizza for dinner that day in lieu of our normal Thanksgiving turkey). Things still aren't totally settled, but they are getting there… slowly but surely. Things like this seem to take a lot longer now than they did in my younger days.

Please  note  the  new  mailing address for the club as indicated below.

Best wishes to all for the new year.
