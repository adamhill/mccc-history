## Amiga's Strengths and Weaknesses

It's been a rough time for me lately, perhaps one of the worst months in recent history. A lot of nasty things have been going on, not the least of which  is  the  recent  failure  of  my Amiga  4000T.  I've  been  kept  too busy  to  properly  examine  the  system yet, but I hope the problem is minor  and  fixable,  given  the  system's  borderline  indispensable  nature to many of my projects. If the situation  persists  I  may  poll  the membership for assistance. The only  upside  here  is  the  hope  for  an easy  fix,  and  the  knowledge  that this is far from the worst I've had to deal with over the last few weeks.

I've noted before that I occasionally see people online that dis the Amiga, going so far as to dismiss its ability  in  its  heyday  as  nothing special.  I'll  admit  to  my  own  bias here,  but  these  detractors  almost invariably  speak  through  a  2015 filter, which an Amiga from the late 'eighties or early 'nineties will find hard  to  compete  with  to  start.  If they compared similar systems from  the  same  year,  I  believe  the differences  would  be  a  bit  more obvious.

I  have  put  some  thought  into  the Amiga's relative strengths and weaknesses, the stuff that helped it stand  out  from  the  pack.  The  first was  the  Amiga's  ease  with  NTSC

and  PAL  video  scan  rates,  a  holdover  from  the  days  when  home computers were expected to hook up  to  a  TV  if  a  dedicated  monitor wasn't  available.  This,  combined with fast full-color graphics made it easy for the Amiga to work in video, from simply recording graphics and animation  on  a  VCR  to  using  genlock hardware to merge Amiga imagery  with  live  video.  This  power was taken to its extreme with Newtek's Video Toaster hardware / software package, which made it possible to use an Amiga to replace tens of thousands of dollars in video  mixing  equipment.  Amigas  and Video  Toasters  became  staples  of cable  TV  studios  and  tons  of  amateur and professional video producers,  cementing  the  system  as  the pioneer  in  the  fledgling  field  of "desktop  video."  It  remained  relevant  even  beyond  the  life  of  Commodore, and wasn't until all-digital video,  high-definition,  and  nonlinear  editing  became  the  norm  that the  Amiga's  influence  faded.  Perhaps if the Amiga wasn't subjected to huge gaps in its development cycle, it might have been able to hold on  to  the  field  it  helped  create. There were options available in the realm  of  digital  video  editing  and playback, but they didn't keep Amiga  afloat.  At  least  the  defeat  was more due to a paradigm shift than stronger competition.

On the side of shortcomings, one of the  Amiga's  bigger  ones  was  networking. While it was possible for the  Amiga  to  connect  online  or form local-area networks with Amigas or other systems, the Windows

and  Mac  systems  were  generally ahead of the game in this area, with the necessary network ports either built-in  or  cheaply available early on, with networking support in the operating system  following suit. While  the  Amiga  was  capable  of connecting  with  other  machines, the  OS  was  never  really  designed with  multiple  users  in  mind,  so things common to networked OSes, such as restricting access to files or directories  to  certain  users  and locking out others, were not available by default, meaning the average Amiga  user  has 'root-level' access over the whole system, which is good for some situations but not all. The Amiga was a slow adopter of a lot of Internet stuff too, especially web-browsing, falling well behind the features of Windows/Mac  browsers  and  the websites that catered to them, though that can be blamed in part on the system's zombie-esque status post-1994.

P.S. After finally getting the chance to look over my Amiga, it is working  again,  though  there  are  some spots that apparently need a little work.  Thankfully  it's  more  of  an inconvenience than a smoking death.

## Quantum Computing in Silicon

October 5, 2015

The significant advance, by a team at  the  University  of  New  South Wales  (UNSW)  in  Sydney  appears today  in  the  international  journal Nature.

'What we have is a game changer,' said  team  leader  Andrew  Dzurak, Scientia  Professor  and  Director  of the Australian National Fabrication Facility  at  UNSW.  'We've  demonstrated a two-qubit logic gate-the central building block of a quantum computer-and, significantly, done it in silicon. Because we use essentially  the  same  device  technology as existing computer chips, we believe it will be much easier to manufacture  a  full-scale  processor  chip than for any of the leading designs, which rely on more exotic technologies.  This  makes  the  building  of  a quantum computer much more feasible, since it is based on the same manufacturing technology as today's computer industry,' he added.

The  advance  represents  the  final physical component needed to realise the promise of super-powerful silicon quantum computers, which harness  the  science  of  the  very small-the  strange  behaviour  of subatomic particles-to solve computing challenges that are beyond the reach of even today's fastest supercomputers.

In classical computers, data are rendered as binary bits, which are always in  one  of  two  states:  0  or  1. However, a quantum bit (or 'qubit')  can  exist  in  both  of  these states  at  once,  a  condition  known as  a  superposition.  A  qubit  operation  exploits  this  quantum  weirdness by allowing many computations  to  be  performed  in parallel  (a  two-qubit  system  performs the operation on 4 values, a three-qubit system on 8, and so on).

'If  quantum  computers  are  to  become  a  reality,  the  ability  to  conduct oneand two-qubit calculations are essential,' said Dzurak, who jointly led the team in 2012  who  demonstrated  the  first ever silicon qubit, also reported in Nature.

Until now, it had not been possible to make two quantum bits 'talk' to each  other-and  thereby  create  a logic  gate-using  silicon.  But  the UNSW team-working with Professor  Kohei  M.  Itoh  of  Japan's  Keio University-has done just that for the first time.

the task of designing and building a functioning quantum computer.

A  key  advantage  of  the  UNSW  approach  is  that  they  have  reconfigured the 'transistors' that are used to define the bits in existing silicon chips, and turned them into qubits. 'The  silicon chip in  your  smartphone or tablet already has around one  billion  transistors  on  it,  with each  transistor  less  than  100  billionths of a metre in size,' said Dr Menno Veldhorst, a UNSW  Research Fellow and the lead author of  the  Nature  paper.  'We've  morphed those silicon transistors into quantum bits by ensuring that each has  only  one  electron  associated with  it.  We  then  store  the  binary code of 0 or 1 on the 'spin' of the electron,  which  is  associated  with the  electron's  tiny  magnetic  field,' he added.

Dzurak  noted  that  that  the  team had recently 'patented a design for a full-scale quantum computer chip that would allow for millions of our qubits, all doing the types of calculations that we've just experimentally demonstrated.'

The  result  means  that  all  of  the physical  building  blocks  for  a  silicon-based quantum computer have now been successfully constructed, allowing engineers to finally begin

He said that a key next step for the project is to identify the right industry partners to work with to manufacture the full-scale quantum processor chip.
