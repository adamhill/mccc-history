## 30 Years of Amiga

In Amiga news, the A-EON train barrels  along  with  the  acquisition  on DVPlayer, a commercial video playing application. This should be valuable  if  the  software  is  developed further. I know little about DVPlayer  myself,  so  I  have  no  idea  what advantages it may have over other video software ported to Amiga/Morph/AROS such as Mplayer  or  VLC.  In  Amiga  gaming  news, Cherry  Darling,  makers  of  'Voxel Bird Saga' and other games for Amiga, MorphOS, and mobile platforms, has released 'Wings Battlefield,' a head-to-head  WW1-style  air  combat game playable against computer or human opponents (via split-screen or over network). Also the  Turrican  anthology  is  coming out, collecting all 3 games from the Amiga  Turrican  series  in  one  volume for CD-32. You probably weren't  expecting  to  hear  about  a new CD-32 release in 2015, even if it  is  a  compilation.  I  know  I  sure wasn't.

With the press on the Amiga's 30th anniversary, I find myself wishing I could  attend  one  or  more  of  the events  going  on  around  the  globe, but circumstances unfortunately prevent that. I can't let it go by completely  unheeded,  so  I  have  been starting production (more like preproduction) on a new Amiga animation project, unofficially completing a  trilogy  of  musical  pieces  with 'Still  Alive'  and  'Only  Amiga' from

2008 and 2010, respectively. With each  video  I  have  bumped  up  the visuals, the first being a black and white animation, and the second a full color rendering. This time I am shooting  for  HD  and  720P  resolution, which has forced me to update and rework the 3D models and textures  as  I  strive  for  a  more  photorealistic  look  (within  the  limits  of old  software and my own 3D skill set). I fear I may be a bit too ambitious this time around, and it seems highly unlikely I'll have this project done  in  the  next  month  or  two while the celebrations are going on. Still, if I can finish it before the year is over, I'm willing to chalk it up as a  win.  Wish  me  luck,  because  I'm probably going to need some.

A  few  months  back,  I  wrote  at length  about  the  reasons  and  relative  merits  of  the  Amiga's  'planar' screen pixels. As I said then, a primary reason for adopting them was that they made more efficient use of smaller  amounts  of  memory.  Efficiency  was  all  the  rage  back  then, largely because RAM chips were expensive.  Many  Amiga  veterans  remember  the  days  when  a  couple megabytes  of  RAM  were  more  expensive than a couple gigabytes today,  and  that's  not  even  adjusting for inflation. It's still fun to look at old  computer  publications  to  find some card with a few megabytes of RAM and a 40 meg hard drive retailing  for  a  thousand  or  more,  when now we probably would throw a fit if  that 8 gig flash drive costs more than  ten  bucks.  Still,  cost  of  chips drives  everything,  perhaps  more obviously  back  then.  It's  why  the

Amiga 500 shipped with a measly 512K  of  RAM,  and  the  A1000  before  it  had  a  measlier  256K.  Step back  to  the  1970s,  and  the  Atari 2600 VCS (the spiritual ancestor of the Amiga) had a mere 128 bytes of  RAM  for  runtime  data.  There was no memory to hold a buffer for the screen. The programs and data on the fixed ROM cartridge generated the screen imagery in time with the television scan rate. This was a very challenging way to work, but it had its own inherent advantages as  well.  A  talented  programmer could use the nature of this method of display to make it seem like there are more graphic objects on screen than the Atari was built to display, by changing position, color and other information of an object while the scan progresses, making one object appear to be two different ones. Using display tricks like these  and  others,  hardware  originally designed for games like Combat, with two player objects firing missile  objects  in  a  simple  playfield  and  little  else,  the  Atari  VCS could  be  made  to  do  surprisingly complex  games  with  many  independently  moving  elements,  with only a few K of ROM and less RAM than  could  hold  the  average  text post on Twitter.

Stepping forward again to the Amiga,  there  remain  a  few  pieces  of that Atari legacy. While the Amiga generally  has  plenty  of  RAM  to hold a display, it can still do a few scan-line tricks, thanks to the 'copper.'  At  a  given  scanline,  the  copper  can  interrupt  the  display  to change  something,  like  the  color value of something. This is seen a lot in games and demos to make a background that changes color without  using  up  a  lot  of  spots  in the  palette.  Better  yet,  the  screen mode or resolution could be changed as well. This was seen in some  software,  like  a  part  of  the interface that required a higher resolution  or  more  colors  than  the main  display.  The  paint  mixer  in Deluxe  Paint  4,  which  used  the HAM  color mode  regardless of what  mode  you  were  currently painting with, is a good example. A better  example  is  when  you  have multiple  programs  each  on  their own  screen,  and  you  drag  one down to peek at the one behind it. It works even though the different screens  have  different  color  palettes and different resolutions, thanks to the copper and the scan line interrupt, and a little Atari legacy-actually Jay Miner legacy, since he worked on both.

That  concludes  my  ramble  for  the day. Stay safe, and I'll see you at the meeting.

## 5 Years of Amiga

July 23, 1985.

If you have an Amiga and or you are a  big  fan  of  the  system,  the  date given here should be one to remember, as it is the day the Amiga made its  debut.  One  source  referred  to that  day  as  the  day  many  a  lesser silicon  marvel  of  the  decade  became obsolete. On this day Commo- dore  introduced  the  Amiga  to  the world, and started a roller coaster ride  that  many  enjoyed  while  others only endured.

Five years is a long time in the consumer  market  and  the  Amiga  has made that time with ohhs and ahhs, controversy  and  change,  love  and hate.  I  wonder  what  the  next  five years  will  bring,  but  we  can  only take a look at the past five.

Several phrases came to be associated with the Amiga after its introduction. One still continues to pop up  today:  'It'll  knock  your  socks off!' Ask yourself how many times that  phrase  has  popped  up  since the  Amiga  began  showing  off  its abilities. Another phrase which popped  up  and  then  faded  away was  'The  Maserati  of  Computers.' How  long  has  it  been  since  you heard that one?

Change has been a big part in the life of the Amiga over the past five years;  some  we've  noticed,  some may have gone unnoticed. Commodore  toyed  with  several  logos.  A few even made it out into the world to be seen. Taking  the  famous checkered  ball  from  the  now  famous demo was considered. They also considered a plain looking 'A' as  the  logo.  Thank  you,  Commodore, for not using that. A rainbow colored check mark was the winner. Well at least for a while. Now 'Amiga' I guess you could say is the logo.

The Amiga itself has changed a lot. The 1000 brought us the Amiga and introduced  the  world  to  its  new ideas  (and  can  be  found  with  and without the Extra Half Bright mode). It was on the market barely 18 months. Early in 1987 the 500 and  2000  showed  up.  Although these two at first appeared to be a compliment  to  the  1000,  they  replaced  it  completely.  There  were two  versions  of  the  2000-a  German  design  and  an  American  design. Commodore decided one was more prepared for the future than the  other,  and  one  passed  away.  I remember  the  rumors  of  the  UX and AT versions that were to come out. Still waiting.

1988 gave us the 2000HD and the impressive  2500,  both  of  which were  just  the  2000  with  add-ons. Both of these have been modified in 1989.  The  2090A  controller  has been replaced by the new 2091 and Quantum  is  now  the  Hard  Drive. The 2500 has had its A2620 68020 CPU  card  replaced  with  a  newer A2630 68030 CPU card.

A  less  noticeable  change  to  the 2000 series has been the change in LEDs. The red power LED has given away to a green one. The disk drive went from red to amber. The hard drive  changed  from  green  to  amber; Was this LED change for a reason?

Changes  internally  have  been  the big  news.  The  true  power  of  the Amiga,  the  now  familiar  custom chips,  have  gone  through  changes-one of which was name. Originally  called  Daphne,  Portia,  and Agnes, Daphne became Denise and is  now  about  to  change  to  Super Denise. Portia has become the Paula. Agnes changed to Agnus, Fat Agnus, and Super Agnus. There have been  other  names  such  as  Obese Agnus heard, but Super was the official  version. Now a newer version has  appeared.  With  this  new  version  the  Amiga  has  moved  from 512K to 1 meg and now 2 megs of chip  ram.  The  Amiga  has  moved through  three  CPUs:  the  68000, 68020, and 68030 with the 68040 just over the horizon.

Commodore has changed their handling of the Amiga, at times appear- ing to some to be confused on how to  handle  their  machine.  At  first they  didn't  want  the  Commodore name  associated  with  Amiga  so they hid it in the rear. Commodore wanted  the  machine  to  be  considered as a serious business machine and  felt  that  the  name  of  Commodore  would  hurt  the  image.  That changed  with  the  500  and  2000the name 'Commodore' was where you could see it. They tried to make sure that the Amiga was only available from the right places. I remember  one  dealer  would  only  show the computer to you if you made an appointment. I bet that moved a lot of them. The advertising in the early  days  I'm  sure  created  the  question of 'What is it?' You remember the  robed  man  walking  up  to  the Amiga,  which  was  all  but  hidden, and he appeared to be lit up by the computer. It made sense, but only if you knew what they were advertising. For the good of the Amiga, recent  ads  have  been  more  to  the point.

Commodore's  changes  from  machine specific to more generic construction such as the connectors in the rear have all been for the better. The 2000's ability to be configured or  changed  gave  Commodore  a good  base  to  work  with.  And  I've applauded Commodore for offering an  upgrade  from  the  1000  to  the 2000.  No  other  company  has  considered doing that for its users. You have to take the good with the bad in everything. At least there seems to be more good.

The introduction of the 3000 gives the  Amiga  a  new  push  for  the  future  and  it  appears  that  Commodore  may  be  prepared  to  finally market the Amiga as they've never done before-trying to grab hold of the  multi-media  madness  in  the business  world  while  enhancing the foothold that it has established.

It's  been  a  bumpy  road,  but  with the dedication of Amiga users, word of mouth, and proven performance,  the  Amiga  has  made  it through these 5 years and is poised for  the  next  5  years  of  progress. The competition has made plenty of moves on the Amiga's previous advantages.  Many  of  the  things  the Amiga has been doing for years are now the latest rage in the rest of the computer industry.

There's  more  to  come  from  Amiga-just wait and see. Some of the competition has done their best to put the Amiga down-throwing the term  'game  machine'  around  the most.

It is estimated that current technology  will  be  obsolete  in  just  three years, but if we look at the C-64 you can see that a home computer can last long after technology has moved on. Just as it looks like the end of the 1000 due to advances in the 2000, along comes the aftermarket to provide an upgrade to move

the 1000 up to provide an upgrade to  move  the  1000  up  to  current standards. The same  thing will surely  happen  to  the  2000  if  and when the time comes. You can buy lots  of  hardware  to  enhance  the Amiga, lots of games, lots of video equipment,  and  lots  of  software. But one must wonder, where is the business  software  base  that  the competition enjoys? We have more places to buy Amigas in the form of dealers,  even  though  Commodore has  declared  war  on  mail  order. There  are  many  new  companies making  products  for  the  Amiga though  we've  lost  many  also.  The same  can  be  said  for  any  other brand.

The  Amiga  is  a  survivor  and  few products on the market could possibly survive what the Amiga has survived. This should certainly make a point.  The  Amiga  has  something that  buyers  want,  no  matter  what other problems there may be. July. 1990  will  be  the  month  the  3000 will go on the market, but come the 23rd,  take  a  moment  and  think  a good  thought  for  the  Amiga  and celebrate  5  years  of  fun  and  awesome computer graphics.
