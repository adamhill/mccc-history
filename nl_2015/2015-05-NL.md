## The 'Bankruptcy' and an Amiga History Blog

The supposed bankruptcy of Amiga OS4  software developer  Hyperion continues to (under)develop. According to their reports, the company is reorganizing and shuffling some management  positions, but never officially met bankruptcy conditions, despite  being  temporarily  listed  as such.  Hyperion  claims  to  still  be developing  the  Amiga  OS,  though there may be delays as their reorganization is ironed out.

Continuing with my recent series on Amiga  stuff,  first  I'd  like  to  highly recommend  the  blog  website  'The Digital  Antiquarian'  by  Jimmy  Maher (http://www.filfre.net/). You might recognize him as the author of 'The Future Was Here' Amiga book among  other  computer  history  volumes. The blog also covers a lot of history  for  computers  and  games. The Amiga got a lot of press in his recent blog articles, such as a history of  one  of  the  Amiga's  first  'killer apps,'  the  game  'Defender  of  the Crown' by Cinemaware. Even better is a three-part series of articles titled 'The 68000 Wars,' which covers much of the Amiga's history from its earliest inception to the shuttering of the  Commodore-Amiga  west  coast division  in  Los  Gatos,  while  telling parallel  tales  of  Atari,  Jack  Tramiel,

their relationships with Commodore and Amiga, and the development of the Atari ST computer. The articles strive  for  honesty,  sometimes  to  a brutal degree, and as much historical accuracy as possible, trying to avoid the more heroic spin often attached by the storytellers. Even so, the Amiga story remains at least as interesting  and  exciting  as  any  ostensibly historical movie or TV series revolving around Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. All we need is to find a suitable canine star to play the part of Mitchie. Summing up, if you have any interest in Amiga history at all, and a spare hour or two, I strongly  urge  you  to  check  out  Mr. Maher's  blog.  You  might  need  to backtrack some to get to the beginning of the '68000 wars' series, but it's  extremely  worth  the  time  and effort for a rewarding read.

## This and That

It's  time  again  for  the  ramblings  of the Veep. A name from the past and one that has been missed. The AMIcast podcast included talks with Petro Tyschtschenko! I had the honor of getting to meet him a few times. He really stood by the Amiga and was a really  great  friend  to  all  with  the systems. You can see more on this at http://amicast.ppa.pl/ Episode 3 was

the talks with Petro. I'll be trying to find  more  on  this  as  I  can.  The headphones  on  the  Pegasos  II  are damaged so I'll have to resort to the PC.

It  has  indeed  been  an  odd  month. The biggest news seems to be that Hyperion  is  claiming  not  to  be  in bankruptcy. Quoted from their site: 'The company was temporally listed as  'bankrupt'  despite  the  fact  that the conditions for bankruptcy were never  met…in  the  eyes  of  the  law.' They also  went  on  to  say  they  are working  on  AmigaOS  4.2.  That  if folks  want  to  help  they  need  to upgrade  to  AmigaOS  4.1  FE  since they will be basing further updates from  there.  The  wording  on  this seems bit odd to me. Like 'Well it's right, but not technically.' That and adding the request for folks to buy more seems oddly timed too. We'll see where things go. Even though I don't have AmigaOS 4.1 I still hope they can keep it going.

http://www.commodorefree.com/ind ex.html has released issue 86. These always have so much to share on all the  Commodore  brand  machines. It's a really good source for info on Amiga  as  well  as  Vic  20  C64,  and even the C16. There was one article in  it  that  caught  my  eye.  Sadly,  it seems that Ralph Baer, the father of gaming  consoles,  passed  away.  He was 92. In the early 1970s Mr Baer built the Magnavox Odyssey. I know a  few  of  you  know  of  that  one  at least.  On  happier  news,  Fire  V0.24 has  been  released.  Not  sure  if  we shared this one before. TAWS, The Amiga Workbench Simulation, runs in  your  web  browser  using  Java.  It runs in IE, Firefox, Opera and WebKit  browsers,  which  includes  OWB. This is something I will be looking at and passing to a few friends that are still  curious  on  the  Amiga  systems. 4.1 is there, but if you look in presets they have earlier Classic versions as well. If nothing else it lets us show others  why  this  system  means  so much to us.

This next link is a history: The Digital Antiquarian.

The age of multimedia computing had http://www.filfre.net/2015/03/the 68000-wars-part-1-lorraine/

The download would seem to be free. So far  it  still  seems  to  be  that  you run  it  on  top  of  something.  Standalone versions are still in the works. I don't know as much on AROS as I'd like but it's something to look into.

As you can see is has been a pretty busy  month  for  Amiga.  MorphOS seems to been rather quiet for now. I'm  curious  to  see  what  comes  up from them soon.

I'm  still  trying  to  get  my  A1200 working again. There is supposed to have been a way to do so with Amiga

This one gives info on the Amiga. The early years and how the original OS wasn't quite what many remember it as. I think this was slightly before I got my A1000. I had kickstart 1.3 for it however I did have earlier disks as  well.  It's  a  good  read. Brings  back  memories  for me at least.

Aros Vision 2.9.2 online has been released. This can be looked at as new or an update. It's going to be adding a  lot  more  as  well  as  be available  for  other  systems including  the  Amiga  Classics. There is more information at http://www.aros platform.de/

Forever,  but  I've  had  no  luck  with that. Formatting the CF card on the Pegasos  II  has  had  limited  luck  at best. I have a few ideas, but getting to them of late has been the biggest issue. I've been having to deal with restricted time due to health issues. Seizures are a pain as are bad medication  interactions  too.  1  thing  I need to look into is getting my external HD floppy drive back on. I just can't remember the right way for the connector. If I can get that going I do have an Emergency boot disk for the A1200. Admittedly it's an older one though.
