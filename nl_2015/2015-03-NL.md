## Net Neutrality Wins: What Now?

February 26, 2015

It's a historic day for the internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  just  passed  the  strongest  net neutrality rules in this country's history.  This  is  great  news!  But  let  me repeat: The battle for net neutrality is still not over. In a sense, the real battle begins now.

Now that the vote is in, a number of parties-namely  cable  companies  and Republicans in Congress-are going to challenge  the  FCC's  authority  in  an attempt to push these rules under the rug. That's what Verizon did in 2011,

the  FCC's  new  net  neutrality  rules. These rules reclassify the internet under Title II of the Telecommunications Act  and  forbid  bad  things  like  paid prioritization (also known as 'fast lanes'),  website  blocking,  and  traffic throttling. These restrictions are good for consumers, but bad for cable company profits.

So there are going to be some lawsuits. AT&amp;T more or  less  promised  to  sue earlier this month when it seemed like the FCC would take Obama's excellent advice and reclassify the internet. The company said in a blog post that those who didn't think the FCC should yield to  compromise  'are  only  deceiving themselves.' Meanwhile, the cable lobby has also made it very clear that they want to challenge the rules in court as well.

ington  Post  recently.  Too  dramatic, too serious a change.

Long story short, there will be a lot of lawsuits. Even the small cable companies are going to sue.

We've long known that Congress could intervene in this whole process. That  could  be  a  good  thing  for  the open  internet,  but  it  looks  like  it's going to be a bad thing. Republicans in  Congress  have  hinted  at  such  an outcome.  Alarmists  like  Ted  Cruz have called the FCC's new  rules 'Obamacare  for  the  internet,'  a  take that's not only dumb but also dangerous. Others say that the government is going  to  start  setting  the  price  for internet service. This is not true.

'I  think it's just too dramatic, too serious a change not to ask the court to the last time the agency  passed  strong  net neutrality rules,  and it's all but certain that cable  companies  will try to do it again. Meanwhile, the Republican-led Congress might intervene with  a  net  neutrality bill that would curtail the  FCC's  ruling,  but that  prospect  seems less likely in the wake of the their inability to

Take bad boy Fred Upton, for instance. Upton-who holds personal invest-

get such a bill together before today's vote.

So how will the private sector respond? Big telecom companies have made it dreadfully clear that they do not like ments in AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon-has introduced legislation that prohibit things like paid prioritization but also eliminate the agency's  authority  to regulate  internet  service providers. This is a dangerous thing for these net neutrality rules,  again,  because in  the  2011  Verizon lawsuit that killed the FCC's old net neutrali-

review the propriety of what the commission did particularly when so much of it rests on whether it had the authority to do it in the first place,' Michael Powell, president and chief executive of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, told The Wash- ty rules, a judge ruled that the agency overstepped  its  authority.  'A  legislative answer to the net neutrality question  will  finally  put  to  rest  years  of litigation and uncertainty,' Upton said recently.

Upton's  contemporaries  have  talked up  the  court  challenges,  too.  Texas Republican Joe Barton calls the new rules 'net nonsense.' (Very cute, Joe.) At  a  House  Energy  and  Commerce subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Barton ran his mouth about the FCC's new rules. 'It's not going to work,' he said. 'It is going to be tested in court and it's going to fail in court.'

Of  course,  this  remains  to  be  seen. The rules will be challenged in court, and  Congress  will  consider  Upton's legislation.  That's  a  little  bit  anxietyinducing if you love the internet.

So, like we've said before, it's not quite time for the we-saved-the-internet parade. It's definitely time to take a deep breath and accept the fact that things are  heading  in  the  right  direction. Challenges  abound.  But  we're  on  a good path to a better internet. Finally.

## Bankruptcy? Again?

In  the  Amiga  world,  perhaps  the  big news  surrounds  Hyperion,  the  software developer behind the Amiga OS4. Documents were turned up apparently showing  the  company  was  filing  for bankruptcy, leading to swirling speculation and doom-saying, and talk that the the OS4.1 'final edition' was pro- phetic.  Since  the  news  first  broke, people supposedly in the know have come  forward,  saying  the  reports  of Hyperion's death are greatly exaggerated and misunderstood. I suppose time will tell the result. It's strange to be in a place where there are multiple avenues of 'Amiga-ness,' where the possible  loss  of  one,  even  the  officially name-endorsed one, could be considered  more  inconvenience  than  true disaster,  though  in  honesty  that's  because the real disasters happened over a decade ago.

Business  goes  on  in  Amiga  circles, regardless. On the heels of purchasing rights  and  developing  Personal  Paint, A-EON  has  acquired  the  venerable Amiga image processing  software  ImageFX  Studio  and  Cinemorph,  and plans to further develop that as well. I look  forward  to  seeing  what  development come of that,  as  I  still  use  ImageFX quite a bit, though I'm still a bit pensive  as  a  MorphOS  user,  since  AEON is in bed with OS4 as a hardware developer, and that it likely their first priority at best, with MorphOS thrown no  bones  at  worst.  Regardless,  it's better  to  see  development  reopening on this  classic  graphic  software  than leaving it in the capable yet stagnant place it's been for a long time. If a few more software classics are dusted off and modernized, the Amiga crowd can have a mini-resurgence, or at least get more use out of the systems they have. AmiKit  version  8  is  available  as  a download package or a bootable flash drive for PC systems. As I understand it, it's a combination of a Linux Distro (AmiPUP),  emulator,  and  Amiga  software designed to give a 'best available' Amiga experience on your garden vari-

I  don't  know  much  about  it yet,  but  new  productivity  software  is always welcome, though it will take a bit to come up to the standard of the classic Amiga DTP application Pagestream.

That's the news for now.

To quote a famous writer: 'The news of  our  demise  is  greatly  exaggerated.' This  is  the  result  of  an  unfortunate administrative mishap by a third party and  is  in  the  process  of  being  addressed / cleared-up. This may take a while  as  everything  takes  a  while  in Belgium whilst it comes to administrative and judicial matters. Those dancing on our grave, sorry guys, no party here.
