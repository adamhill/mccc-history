## By Dean E. Strand Quad Cities

In every communication medium, starting at least 35 early as the electric telegraph, there has always been some sexually-centered conversation between inen and women. Back in the last century, there were many lady telegraph operators and there were romances developed over the wire that many times culminated in marriage. The exchanges were very genteel, reflecting Victorian times. There was a similar phenomenon on amateur radio, and the telephone has surely generated huge amounts of sexual communication: but much less well-documented because of the nature of the medium.

The personal computer has also generated interchanges over telephone. There are many telephone bulletin boards, some local and some nationwide, that offer a variety of services. There has been information, legal libraries, access to hat dier fock market encylopedias, on-line banking, shopping services etc. It was just 3 matter of time before sexual information was made available on BSS.

The book "The Electronic Confessional" describes these services as available through Compuserve. Human Sexuality, abbreviated HSX, is part electronic magazine and part meeting ground. Imagine being able to pick up a copy of Time and not only being able to read the current issue but any article that you desire from any previous issue. imagine being able to talk to other people who are reading the magazine at the same time.

The first HSX page is intended to warn off readers who might be offended, and then HSX goes on to the main menu. There are 3. large number of articles available covering variety of sexual subjects. This functions like any computer bulletin board.

The support groups are accessed by going into the "room" where the activity is going on. The support groups are under the "Teens Talk", "Man heading of "Women Only" "person to person" to Man" , "Singles Club" and more. "Dear Diane" offers advice from a psychotherapist, "Matter of Morals" deals with issues of ethics and religion. "Alternatives" is for people who engage in transvestism, fetishes and other options. "Gay Youth" seeks to relleve the isolation common to young gays.

"Encounter Group" delves deeply into members feeling, "Sex Ed for Adults" features in-depth seminars led by a medical school faculty member. "You and your Body" deals with such issues as weight control, body image and handicaps. In "Fantasyland". you can explore dreams, fantasies, astrology, the occult, and other phenomena of the unconscious: "Slug it Out" is a verbal gym where you can release your aggressions and hostilities.

"Rusty's Pub" is a friendiy cafe where you can discuss current sex-related news. In "Cope With Crisis", a trained therapist offers help with problem situations. "Debbie's Dairy" is one woman's highly personal journal. "Formerly Married' is for people who are divorced, separated or widowed.

This book is available at the Davenport Public Libarary. The catalog number is 386.7. There are many good computer books in the area's public libraries. If you have not been in the library lately, you may be surprised by the up-to-date computer books they have.

## THE PRINTER &amp; CONDENSED PRINT

Bill O'Neill C.U.G. of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ

Some people have reported having trouble printing condensed print, full width of the printer. This should not be a problem as long as the program you are using has its margins set wide enough and is capable of sending 120140 characters per line. If the program is not at fault, then the problem may lie with the printer interface. Some interfaces, in trying to emulate the CBM 1525 printer, trap certain printer codes and restrict the print width to 80 characters per line, It sends a carriage return and line feed on its own after S0 characters on a line. Check your interface manual to see if this is the source of the problem. If it is, then · the problem becomes how to outwit an interface that is too smart for its own good. There are three ways in general to do this.

FIRST - Some interfaces have several different modes of operation, some of which provide conversion of CBM ASCII to true ASCII without trapping printer codes or limiting the

My job is to edit. Without the flow of information from you, the newsletter becomes ineffective.

I ask you to make your feelings number of characters per line (such as the Super Graphix mode on Xetec interfaces), Check your manual and if such a mode exists, use it. That should be the easiest way to solve the problem.

SECOND - Some interfaces allow you to change the print width with a Print width Command. Check your interface manual and if such a command exists, use it. The command must usually be sent over the interface command channel loften with a secondary address of 15) and should be sent before running your program: For example, the command for a Xetec interface would be:

## OPEN4,4,15:PRINT#4,"W"CHR$(n):CLOSE4

(where n is the new print width limit.)

If none of these suggestions work, then buy a new interface.

THIRD - Almost all interfaces allow unlimited print width in transparent mode. If the program you are using can supply true ASCIl so that no conversion by the interface is necessary, then lock the interface in transparent mode before running the program (OPEN4,4.24:PRINT#4: CLOSE4).

## LIFE IN THE FAST LANE

By Glenn Leach Gainesville, FL

This will increase its speed to acceptable limits and offer a measure of protection at the same time. The protection: of course, pertains construction of the program, not the program itself.

BASIC is a friendly langusge that permits = relatively easy introduction programming. For large programs, however, it has one significant drawback -- it is BASIC programmers know many tricks to speed program , from the placement of subroutines through the use of integer variables whenever possible, the highest marks for speed go to programs written in machine language (L) This is one of several reasons why most commercial programs are written in If you have a favorite BASIC program whose only bad point is its slow performance, longer programs, rewrite it in ML to increase its speed more than ten times in most cases. Of course, without a working knowledge of ML: that's useless advice.

Compiled programs load and run regular BASIC program. As such, they can also be copied from disk to disk without difficulty. While ML programs are more compact than the equivalent BASIC program: this is not necessarily true of compiled programs. time module is added to the front of the program to translate it for the computer. This run time module is very busy when the original program was written in a BASIC extension. In simple test programs, the BASIC64 run time module added 19 blocks, or approsimately 4800 bytes to the program, With (cont'd on Fade 4)

thanks to the ingenuity of others, however, it is possible for those of us without ML skills to convert BASIC programs to higher speed ML, or Mi-like code. accomplished with a program called a compiler, which compiles the BASIC code into either psuedo code or ML. Do compilers work well? Yes. If you atttempt to LIST some commercial prorams, you will SES 2048 PERSPEED set a one-line LIST like, "10 This indicates the program was compiled using a compiler called PETSPEED. There are several compilers on the market for the C64, and each has features that make it attractive, Similarly, each has drawbacks. One of the most common drawbacks is illustrated by the SPRINT program in the January 1986, Compute's Gazette. This is a beat, but you find that you must use a special dialect of BASIC, as Sprint will not compile all of the BASIC 2.0 commands, degree, this was true of other compilers I have used, until I tried BASIC-B4, from Abacus Software,

## THE GURU SPEAKS

Compiled by Rick Schluz

A cloud of incense lazily curls up toward the ceiling. In the distance a gong sounds and silence falls over all as... The Guru Speaks

Guru, I accidentally deleted the wrong file from 3 disk. Is there a way to correct my mistake?

The Guru awakes and answers: Yes. Be more careful next time. But seriously, if you own Workbench 1.2, in a CLI window enter the following command:

DISKDOCTOR DFO:

The machine will then instruction you to insert functional compiler at a price that is hard to the disk to be repaired into drive DF0 and to press the RETURN key. Do this, and perhaps your file shall be restored to you. A word of caution, however: if you inadvertently delete a file and wish to restore it, DO NOT save any file to that disk! The file, you see, is not truly deleted, but the space it occupies has been marked for re-use. Diskdoctor will restore the file to a normal status. But it you save another file to that disk, the new file may be written over the old: and not the great powers of the Guru will be able to restore the file,

Ed. Note: The Guru may not be speaking much these days because no one is asking. Even if YOU have already found the answer to g question which puzzled you, pass it on to the editor. Chances are that others have or will have the same problem. It's nice to have the program to sell, you can employ an enhanced answer in the back of vour mind before the compiler has all the features I was looking for and a few I didn't even know I needed. Most of all, not only will it compile all of the BASIC 2.0 commands, but it will also compile commands deriving from extensions of BASIC such as SIMON's BASIC. As compiling reduces the program to ML or ML-like code, this means that you can write a program using the enhanced commands of a BASIC extension: compile it, and Your friend will be able to use (run) the program even though he does not have the extension program. If you have a great idea for a BASIC to write it. and compile it using BASIC- question pops up.

the compaction resulting from the conversion to ML will overcome the increase in length due to the run time module, with a net decrease in program length after compiling.

## WHY LOAD"O.** Bob Kinsey

When you first turn on your computer and disk drive, you can load the first program on the disk by:

LOAD"*",8

When you load a program from the disk drive, the name is stored in the disk drive's memory, When you use:

LOAD"*",8

odd syntactical constructions that so often the disk drive looks for a program name in memory, If there is no name in memory, it defaults to the first program on the disk. If you have loaded a program, say the fourth program. Or you loaded the first program that program loaded the second, third, and fourth programs. The fourth program is the last program loaded. The name of that program is stored in the disk drive's memory. Now, if you use:

LOAD"*",8

it will load the fourth program on the disk. To now load the first program on the disk using:

Compiling programs written in pure BASIC 2.0 is easy, requiring only that you boot BASIC-64, hit (RETURN) when the menu appears, replace the BASIC-64 disk with the program disk (be sure there is room for the compiled program plus the runtime module on the disk, enter the programname. · and nit (RETURN), If the program ran in BASIC, it will compile readily. Your compiled program will appear on the disk as 'P-programname. Load as f-programname and run it as you would a BASIC program.

You must turn off your computer or disk drive or both to reset the disk drive. Then turn everything back on. Now:

will load the first progran on the disk. There is also an easy way.

This will always load the first program on the disk:

If errors have crept into the program, BASIC-64 will tell you what they are and LOAD"*" where in the program they are, greatly expediting the process of fixing the error. Other features of BASIC-64 include the opportunity to specify the starting address of the compiled program in case it must be compatible with other programs to be loaded LOAD"*",8 into memory with it, and the chance to build an overlay that will permit a series of programs that will share the same variables. The compiled program will be in 6502/6510 code: speed code, or both, depending on the needs LOAD"O:*",8 of the program or the application intended. You can also remove the run time module and treat it as a seperate program together, in which case you will need to sis to the starting address of the compiled program. With these two features combined, a sophisticated set of prorams can be merged together, sharing the same set of variables, and saving both code and execution time.

## DOUBLE QUICK BROWN BOX

## Review by John Premack, SPRITE, Boston Computer Society

Many of us buy a computer to help make out lives easier. Then we spend the rest of our lives looking for ways to make using the computer essier. Two fellow BCS/CUG members: Barbara Mintz and Brown Pulliam: have spent hundreds of hours refining a device which goes a long way toward making life easier for all Commodore computer owners,

Many users have already heard of the Quick Brown Box, an punningly named cartridge for the C-64 which retain the contents of its 8K memory after the computer has been lurned uff. Unfurtunalely, sh just isn't a lot of memory. C-128 users are quickly disappointed to discover that plugging in the automatically turns their computer in to Programmers and hackers were delighted to have instant access to short utilities and the insurance that a crashed program could be instantly recovered, but the rest of us were left wondering why we couldn't put our favorite programs into the

Brown and Barbara spent over a year looking for ways to improve Pulliam's invention, The results are impressive. The capacity of the device, renamed Double Quick Brown Box, has been increased to 16K. The external switch that allowed data to be written to the box has been eliminated. The latest version will work with either the C-64 or the C-128. Best of all, a slew of special software makes using the DOBB a snap.

Outwardly the Double Quick Brown Box is identical to its 8K predecessor. The little red push button provides a system reset for the 64 and duplicates the function of the reset button on the 128. The two-position slide switch is still there too, but has a new function. The DQBB can be switched between 64 and 128 modes--and your 128 won't come up as a 64 when the switch is in the proper position. And if use a C-84, the switch provides an added bonus. It's no longer necessary to unplug the DOBB from the cartridde port whenever it isn't needed. Setting the switch to 128 makes the box invisible to a C-64.

Mintz's special utilities (supplied) allow to put almost any programs) under 16K into the DQBB. One notable exception is machine language programs that to NOT employ a BASIC loader, Otherwise the DOBB will automatically figure out where a program wants to be and send it to the proper

While machine language hackers and BASIC programmers will find special uses for the Box, most of us only want to store a few of our favorite programs for instant access. to eight programs can be called with three key-strokes from a start-up menu, box currently contains two programs which I use when maintaining the BCS/CUG bulletin board: a machine language text editor and a compiled (Blitz!) disk utility This particular configuration has saved to disk as a single file, allowing to reload the box with programming utilities or use it as non-volatile BASIC workspace. A spectial boot utility (supplied) enables the software controlled write-line and allnas me to reinad mo favarito programa in less than a minute.

It isn't possible to describe every possible configuration and feature of the Double Quick Brown Box in a brief review, The DQBB will serve different people in different ways. documentation provides step-by-step instructions for neophytes and fairly thorough guidance for experienced programmers who wish to plant some of their own ideas into this device's C-MOS ROM chips. With 3 oneyear repair or replacement warranty and a 30day unconditional refund period, the Double Quick Brown Box is one of the safest computer investments you can make.

## JIFFYDOS 64

Thomas Benton, CCCC CCEE, Tucson, AZ

This system is enabled by replacing the stock Commodore 1541 DOS ROM and C-64 Kernal ROM and providing high-speed communication routines. changes orientation from tape to disk Derault LOAD SAVE are to the disk drive, not to tape.

My personal interest for the last four to st tour years has been in the area of MIDI music performance and composition. The major drawback of the C-64 and 1541 has been the excruciatingly slow loading of music files usually known 3s sequences or songs. A full 4000 notes average 1 minute 30 seconds to load. None of the fast load systems could be used because they took up the cartridge slot or used up memory or were incompatible, I am very happy to report that all of this is history! With JiffyDos ($49.95), the average loadino time is now about 8 seconds, What a relief it is!

CRC is the preferred method of receiving and sending files, but set it before you access the bulletin board.

The first program you will need a copy of is DE-LBR.OBJ. It isn't legal to copy or send ,COM filetypes, Use the built-in command of rename to change any : OBJ filetype to. COM.

RENAME DE-LBR. CM-DE-LBR.OBJ

Most of the files on BBS's are of the LBR filetype and the modules need to be extracted using DE-LBR or NULU.

Local CP/M BBS's require their uploads be squeezed, which compress files by taking out certain characters, To put these files back in their original condition, unsqueeze them using NSWEEP OR NULU, which are also public domain.

Using the KEYFIG)COM and HELF file that came with your system disk to utilize the function keys, For utilities I reprogramed mine to:

| Imp-terin   | F2 Rename   |
|-------------|-------------|
| F3 Dir      | 14 Type     |
| F5 Nsweep   | F6 Pip      |
| F7 Nul u[5] | F8 Format   |

Funkeys ver. 3.5 prints out a nice template for your function keys,

These tips will help you get started and make your transition into CP/M BBS's a little smoother.

In order to have relevance to all 64 users; I borrowed software from friends and made comparisons between the regular C-64 mode and JiffyDOS. I also used a C-128 in 64 mode and discovered that the revision had resulted in a small speed increase in the revised C-64. JiffyDOS includes a switch that allows changing to regular mode in case a particular disk does not load, Fellows Enterprises guarantees compatibility or vour money back. There is aiso a 9ü-day free exchange warranty on the kit. The following chart shows comparative loading times C-64: JiffyDOS,

CAUlION: If you own a C-84 which has a soldered-in Kernal and are not exceptionally talented in this field, I strongly urge that a professional do the work for you. Fellows will do the installation for a very modest $20 fee. I messed mine up and was lucky when Mark Fellows restored it to lifel Disk drives haye sockets and are not ditticult to do.

D 57.8 sec 9.66 sec DIR: Shift/Fl displays disk directory to screen. I did not have time to compare saves. ! It can also be printed from disk with did use the ReNew function on several full OPEN4,4: CMD4 followed by DIR command disks and was amazed at the close to 2 second restored to screen by entering PRINT#4:CLOSE4, format time. RUN/STOP key ends listing at any time.

DLIST: enables a BASIC file to be listed to the screen or to a printer directly from the drive without loading into the C-64 memory first. BASIC program files only!

DRIVE: used in multiple drive systems to specity or display the derault drive device number.

ERR: used to read and display the disk drive error status.

FKEY: enables and disables JiffyDOS function key definitions, When powered up in JiffyDOS mode, F keys are enabled. One touch:

|           | F1 = LOAD         |
|-----------|-------------------|
| F3 = SAVE | FZ = DIR F4 = SCR |
| F5 = RUN  | F6 = REN          |
| F7 = LIST | F8 = ERR          |

FORMAT: used for a new diskette or in a very quick short form for a used diskette. Short format about 2 sect!

INIT: initializes the default disk drive or specified drive.

REN: used to rename a file or diskette

SCR: used to delete a file from a diskette, Can also delete groups.

TYPE: used to list the contents of an ASCIl file to the screen or to a printer.

UNNEW: used to recover a BASIC program that has been accidentally NEWed. It will siso recover a BASIC program lost when the computer is reset.

VAL: use to free unused blocks on (validate) a diskette.

A good, clearly-written, 41-page manual comes with the kit and explains the enhanced functions, Speed gains are claimed for such things as sequential file access-read &amp; write: relative file access-read &amp; write, disk formatting, soft &amp; hardware compatibility. In my case: I had 100% compatibility, including interfaces and printer. The additional commands included are very useful; for example, pressing SHIFT and RUN/STOP simultaneously loads the first program found on 3 disk (= same 35 BASIC LOAD ', 8 and RUN. DOS wedge commands are included, lock and unlock files, directory listing, cursor function, cursor to listing loads, copy file on default or specified drive, backup original, etc. Even head rattle has been zapped! With JiffyDOS, the greatest benefits are realized when re-saving files in Jiffy mode. The longer the files, the greater the sain in speed: from 6 to 10 times as fast. Saving program files can be as much as 4 times as fast, again depending on

Personal conclusion: If you have the desire to really improve your C-64/1541 system, JiffyDOS 64 is the answer! I could not be more happy with my conversion! As a club buy, 20 or more orders would give us a price of $32.95: including UPS. Additional ROMS are available for multiple systems. Also, a system is being developed for the 128.

For those who missed last month's (April) meeting - you really missed a great meeting!! The program featured a demonstration of seven printers. including dot matrix, ink jet, thermal and laser printers. Both color and standard printers were featured. This was a great opportunity for our members to examine, side by side, several different kinds of printers.

The May meeting will feature a presentation on Digi-View, GenLock and software capable of modifying HAM images (not to be confused with pictures of Miss Piggy and other swine art), Many of us have digitized pictures from the disks of the month and have discovered that DPaint, Aegis Images, Graphicraft and other such software cannot handle such pictures. Software is now available to do this! Don't miss this meeting!

As a reminder, our meetings begin at 7 p.m., with the business meeting beginning at p.m. With your cooperation, the business meeting will last fifteen to twenty minutes, with the rost of the tim o dovoted to tho month's presentation. If you need copies of any disks from the chapter library, please to come early to avoid the last minute rush.

Plans for June are being formulated by your executive chapter officers. and in Juli representatives from Disk Publishers Inc. will be on hand to demonstrate their new product.
