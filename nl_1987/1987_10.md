## ANALYZE!

The folks at Micro-Systems Software have been busy, and the fruit of their latest efforts is a new and improved Analyze! The primary advantage in this version is its speed and the new graphics. I have been told that the first release of Analyze! was relatively slow; this version is fast. How much faster than competing products, I don't know. I don't own the other products and lack access to any reliable benchmark test. However, I think this issue is somewhat academic the products that run on the Amiga are fast, and are considerably faster than IBM. Fractions of seconds in computing time don't interest me. Never the less, this improvement may be very important to some of you, and so I mention it for your benefit.

Analyze! passes this test with flying colors. I KnOw a little about spreadsheets, and without reading the manual I was spreadsheet, revise the contents and produce several graphs. Most of the major functions can be accessed through

I have always thought that the less one must rely O1l the printed documentation to use the software, the better the software is. In other words, a really well written piece of software will guide the user through its primary operations with little or no dependency on the printed documentation. One should not have to memorize a user guide in order to cause the basic functions to be executed. If it can't be explained in a screen or on the pull-down menu, then the program is probably trying to do too much at once and will probably not do that task particularly well. This may seem like a rather stringent criteria, but I would rather spend my time at the computer using the software than reading and rereading and cross referencing the documentation.

## Review by Rick Schulz

pull-down menus and function keys. In fact. Analyze! makes use of all ten function keys, with a help screen generated by Fles, like pull-down menus and mouse controlled functions.

Occasionally the editor appears to have fallen sleep. Consider the following directions: "Graphs can contain up to six ranges per group with an unlimited number of groups and elements in the ranges." Are groups composed of ranges: or ranges composed of groups? One must read the documentation carefully to solve this puzzle.

The user guide is one of the better documents published. The first chapter is a general introduction to Analyze! and the concepti of spreadsheets. The next chapter is a beginner's tutorial, followed by an "advanced tutorial", The documentation, especiaily the tutorials, is very good for anyone with little or · 10 experience in spreadsheets. The first two chapters even cover such topics as how and when to make backup copies of the disk and how to assign directories, taking into account that some people will have two disk drives and some will only have one. Yes, friends, the disk is not copy protected. and there is no dongle to plug into a port. This feature alone insures that Analyze! gets an extra star in the ratings.

Chapter 7 is a concise overview of the menus and optionsi no more guessing what the effect of a command will be! Once you have mastered the tutorials: most of the time you spend reading the manual will probably be here.

The program supports macros, and.

The documentation also contains a glossary and an inder. However, I found these sections to be a little thin. In fact, when trying to find "group" their defintion of and "range", they were of help at all.

again the documentation steps you through the process of creating executing macros. It is this feature that makes Analyze! truly competitive with Maxiplan, and places it in the category of professional software.

Analyze! will import Lotus 1-2-3 files as well as its own, so the transition from the IBM world to real computing is made easier. Label prefixes efunctions are identical to Lotus; however, the section on macros is much easier to understand than the book which accompanied the Lotus 1-2-3 package.

A spreadsheet without macros is no true spreadsheet at all.

The new release sports a powerful graphics option. One can choose one of seven different kinds of graphs: pie: bar chart, line graph, K-Y, stacked bar graph, 3-I pie chart and 3-D bar chart.

Also, the graphs can generated in 4 colors or 8 colors. This seems to cover most of the common options ‹I can't think of what is missing). Like MaxiPlan, one can change the values in the spreadsheet and the graph changes automatically, However, the graphics require considerable After loading Analyze! from Workbench. there is approximately 180K left (I have 5120), A 4 color graph will use about35K. and an 8 color graph will use about 50K, depending on the size of the spreadsheet. Unless you have expanded to megaешогу, you would do well to keep these factors in mind when creating graphs. Analyze! will allow up to 4 graphs to be displayed at one time, if there is sufficient memory, The graphs can also be saved as pictures for use in paint programs like DPaint, or for display. via the "show" option found in the various directory utilies.

## WHO DO YOU TRUST ??

George Pope, CCCC, Inc. Tucson, AZ

Events continue to remind me of an old-old gem of wisdom that asks about the wisdom of leaving a for to guard the hen-house. Unfortunately, there is a parallel computer world. Specifically, salespeople that are either hardware/software is good or too unprincipled to care.

See the parallel? The fox assumes the disguise of helpful salesperson.

When trusting i customers look to the salesman for advice an area where the salesperson should be knowledgeable, too often the sales clerk is more interested in making the sale (or commission) than he or she is interested in satisfying the needs of the customer. Consequently all too often the customer walks away with a piece of hardware or software that either isn't the best for their specific needs. It спева: 10 merely "in stock."

WHAI CAN YOU DO? Simple! Do your homework. Question those experienced with the area you are concerned with to get their opinion. Get more opinions from others in the listings. Circulate at club meetings and ask, ask ask! Then draw your own conclusions from an informed position derived from someone that is not motivated by PROFIT, How do those you ask become 50 expert? Many of us have made the mistakes and having made them are inclined to share the error to hopefully prevent another from making the same error, Can we make more mistakes? Sure, and probably will. For example this article has been written by the former owner of a $325 Commodore 1525 printer

## TITLE SCREEN

## John Byhoffer, Ventura

Have you ever sat there, staring at your monitor · screen trying to think of some kind of title display you could use for that program you just finished writing? Well, here's something I came up with that might help to give you some ideas. This program draws border around the 40-column screen. beginning from a point at the top. down each side simultaneously. The two halves then meet again at the to the center draw another smaller box that you might use for your program title. The program contains only one PRINT statement (in the first line, to clear the screen), and the rest is done with POKE and READ/DATA statements. The data statements contain the screen character codes for the title itself, so you can insert the appropriate numbers for whatever you want to print there.

Why not just use PRINT statements instead of POKEing everything onto the screen you ask? I guess I just did it this way as an exercise in programming for a change. Why not? If nothing else: it helps you understand how the VIC chip puts things on the screen.

## EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO XEROX ABOUT COPYRIGHTS.

(C) Glynn Harris, 1987 in the Public Domain want to explain a little I have found out about copyright law, because it is really getting to be an important subject for everybody in the computer world, not just for artists and playwrights and novelists. Now it is necessary for Programmers to know what part of their work, if any, is protected from use or reproduction without their consent.

It is also IMPERATIVE that computerists know where they stand when or use somebody's copyrighted product. and how to do Right by programmr themselves, because the claims of some software companies "licenses" make the subject really confusing.

DO I KNOW LAW? NO. BUT IF YOU HUM FEW BARS...There are folks who necessarily spend years working with the Ins and Outs of U.S. Copyright Laws. and 5o it is not likely we are going to wring out all the details here. Moreover, I am not a lawyer, and they are the experts in the field. I have just been exposed to a few viewpoints here and there, because as editor of a newsletter that NEEDS material to exist, the temptation to borrow blindly is strong. I wrestle occasionally with both conscience and pride - I lose out to each.

GIVE ME LOTUS 1-2-3 OR GIVE ME DEATH I feel I'm not the only one who IHE PLAIN FAR. Copyright law is not instinctive. read a government pamphlet, talked with some friends, a librariani looked it up in the encyclopedia. I still can't believe it is such a mess.

But the first point to make is this: It 15 Law, No one guarantees it makes sense. Law is not bound to such things (ask a lawyeri law supersedes sensibilities),

One can at least hope that there is some sort of principle that originally guided the lawmakers.

Now there can't really be an "idea marketplace" where people pay for the value of innovations, perspectives. unique applications, and Just plai hard work - not it these same things can be stolen for free, People can't stop letting others have the products of their minds, either:

Point Iwo: Ideas, your thoughts, are not and cannot be owned by anyone. But a Creation of your mind and talents and ideas CAN be owned: bought, sold, traded, and controlled. It is put "on the marketplace" by you. (Even Patent laws, which we aren't going to go into much, recognize this point - a sound patent is · based the shown Application of an idea... the idea is protectable once it makes its PRACTICAL appearance.)

wishes that, in the true spirit of fellowship, I could take this and that and pass it along, certain in the knowledge that the author INTENDS us to be so enriched. In computer circlesisuch tellowship is tradition. We tend to assume that since we are not out for profit. we can disseminate whatever we find. But combine this with a lack of understanding of what a copyright is and does, and the stage is set people to scream "Pirates" and accuse the whole computer world of what few actually do Knowingly: Some think, for instance, that is a copyright a symbolic term for "Please give me credit for having originated this". Heck, I've seen Program Copy Services, calling themselves Libraries, that run on the premise that as long as the author gets credit the screen listing: copyright obligations have been fulfilled. The more reputable libraries all have store-bought programs, and that in itself is no sin. But some individuals who libraries peruse the confused \_ get a bit isn't that software company defunct? Well, then, the program is Public Domain, wouldn't you say?

Hey, I'm looking from both sides of the fence and cursing the fence that spoils the view.

The only solution which allows a market for the creative intellect is to 45e society's coercive force: Government. What we are talking about is was inclined agree: I wish I had copied all those programs before I started reading about copyrights.

Kegulated market. Government enforces Property Rights stealing occurs, thus the market is able to function.

Point Three: What copyright law was designed to do is pretty simple: it was designed to protect someone's unique means of expressing: and perhaps profiting from, the expression of an idea. But it also was designed so that ideas themselves were free to exist, with or without that particular means of expression.

CRIME &amp; PUBLISHMENI=*** What can be covered by Copyright? Well, it has got work product. It is claimed as an Original product by creator. Its protection under the law begins the moment it is created. Its creation must not inhibit other's expressions marketplace. about the limit to copyrighting: So.

Your speech is not copyrighted. Your speech particular captured for posterity on a tape recorder or by a scribe, may copyrightable, In order to do so, you must claim that speech work specifically originating from you. At the time of the speech, you have created the work, but if you do not claim it to be yours alone, you share it with the world until you do claim it Once claimedr have a lot of people use your work: even if they were exposed to your prior your claiming it.

is not copyrightable. Anyone with a camera can your picture, and copyright the photographi NATIONAL ENQUIRER. Your tough luck.

Hey, could they claim it first? Yeah. In cases like that, you must prove particular expression could only have from you as the creator, and that you meant it to remain yours at the time of its creation. Good Luck Sport.

So the more recent revisions to the copyright code state only that the work has to appear before a significant group of people, say publication in journal something like that: it is copyrighted! Or you can claim a copyright the moment something exists writing "Copyright (C) 1987 The Author is considered a notice to the world that you have total ciaim on the work. The legal purist will: however, note that in court, a Copyright filed with the Copyrignt is generally considered Iron-clad Evidence of the

The ones who work are generally the creators, unless the has in one or another relinquished his authority to claim work by giving over that authority another party. If you submit an article for publication to a magazine Startext, you can claim your copyright prior to its publication. If you do it may become property of the publisher. publisher has implicit sort of agreement the person submits agreement comes from whether how you expect to be paid for your and under conditions you restrict their own right to re-use their product.

This i5 copyright keep changing. The lawmakers try to protect everyone who has a right to the protection, even if the creators/artists, etc. are not being too bright about protecting themselves. It used to be that registration with the U.S. Copyright Office was essential or your work was considered "dedicated" to the public. But registration was a lengthy process and a bit of a hassle: Forms, tees: copies of the work donated to the Library of Congress.

Startent, for example, is a copyrighted work. Everything in it comes copyright blanket EXCEPT: when the author claims the rights prior to the work going online. So, if I want to copyright this column the Dallas Timex/Sinclair Users Group: all I have to do is say 50, By doing that they may choose to publish what I volunteered to them only if they assert my claim and my byline, somewhere noticeable in their issuance my work. If I don't say so,

The program is written for the C-b4, but it will work on the 128 if you change one thing--the

history of a work. If you want to make money off work, you should protect Government's stamp...

By doing that, they may choose to publish what I volunteered to them only if they assert my clalm and my byline, somewhere noticeable in their issuance of my work. If I don't say 50, 01 I say (C)1987 STARTEXT instead, then I have assigned the copyright to them. and I release them from having to ask my permission if they want to use my work later (to show the talent available to their subscribers! When the work is theirs, they may choose to defend their right to it vigorously as they wish like if it shows up on another pay news-andinformation service or BBS.

Well, can you copyright a compilation of other works? Only if the act of compiling is considered at least as much an original effort of creation as the works which appear in it. That stuff works for statistical compilations, for instance, Trivia games are copyrightable, A compilation of disco records you taped from your album collection is not really considered an original effort. No matter in what order you got all the Star Trek episodes on Paramount Pictures-Television holds the copyright - and even the commercials in between are owned by Somebody.

Copyrights apply literary works articles, novels, abstracts, reviews, poetry, programs, transcriptions, etc. They apply to artistic works songs, paintings, engravings, typefaces, charts, photographs, statues, visual designs, etc. They apply to performance works like recordings (audio; video, AND machine-control programs), plays: live performances: speeches: eto:

Copyrights don't apply to generai principles or processes, inventions, etc. (Patents cover those types of things). Circuit board artwork is copy-rightable, but the circuit itself is not - though · circuit may be patentable: Copyright doesn't apply to anything which has been considered dedicated to the Public. You can't copyright the vowels, or the Gettysburg Address (I suppose Lincoln could have, but didn't), A creator can specifically say that a work is to be considered Public Domain. Subsequent copyrighting of that work is invalid. This is the basis for the tradition of Public Domain software libraries and bulletin boards. It is unfortunate that individuals bother few anymore with Public Domain. They just don't remember what was like when computers were rare and software was rarer, This is a situation that only software authors can change, if they can overcome their entrepreneurial urges.

Copyrights, like patents, expire. In setting up monopoly, the government is careful not to begin something it would have to deal with forever. It so happens that this is the trickiest and stickiest thing for lawmakers to decide on because writers always want to make sure their kids eat, too. long while: copyrights had a duration of 56 years, or the lifetime of the author plus fifty years, whichever is greater, Then they changed the law so that you could have a copyright for only 28 years, but could renew it for another 28. Then they changed the law, in 1978, that the renewal was 47 years: 28 ÷ 47 = 76 years. Alternately: the life of the author plus 50 years would be the duration. If it was created because someone hired you to create it, another duration came on the scene: Works from organizations and anonymoustypes would be protected for · 75 years from · the publication of the work: or 100 years from creation. the

The reason for going into this is that more changes are · apparentiy going to come out because nobody is satisfied the law guarantees them a place in posterity, Additionally, if you did something prior to 1978, it is protected differently than something you just created.

LIFE'S A GAME OF GIVE AND TAPE=So what CAN a copyright do? It is an assertion of PROPERTY RIGHTS. Like any property it would be foolish to post "No Trespassing" on something you didn't really care to hold as your own. But once you have claimed your right the property, it is yours to: publish reproduce freely, extract from, add to, sell, rent, trade, and control any public (and some private) uses 0f your work.

Reproduction or use without your consent as copyright holder is prohibited: This is true even if it is no longer being published. and hard for others to get.

In fact, you don't have to defend a copyright in order to maintain the property right safely, If you grant freedoms without restriction to another, however, it is not possible to "take back" your exclusive rights. Most holders, therefore, reserve all rights to themselves. and grant permission to others only if they ask nicely and the argument strong, perhaps in money terms.

THE WAR ON DUBS··Gee, can I be sure NOT violating somebody's property rights? What about similar products, like imitations? righted stuff and NOT violate the law?

Imitations first.

earlier I said copyright should not, in its creation, inhibit someone else's expression of ideas in marketplace. Boy, what a can of doesn't Really specifically anything like that. comes down like this: If it ain't the expressed, then of expression is alone. Not Copyrightable. It it is the same idea being expressed, a similarity of expression may exist SOMEWHAT.

moment it may be judged to have invoked a semblance existing copyrighted work, without phrases to prove it, you dangerous ground. Imitations, while a sincere form of flattery, legally according to their tendency to suggest the original to the minds of the people who

Remember K.C. Munchgame for the ill-fated Magnavox Odyssey Il game system. They claimed that though it Looked like Pac-Man and you controlled it like PacMan, the rules of the game sufficiently different - the plot was changed. courts everybody who played the playing Pac-Man, matter what the box really playing. Was the idea the same or style? Did created K.C. intend to capitalize similarities to Pac-Man? Betcha: said courts. Copyright infringement for sure, My opinion is that they were correct: Sadly, K.C. Munchkin was a fun game and vastly superior to the Pac-Man that Atari was putting out. All K.C. could do was give up the ghost (wockawocka-wocka),

Of course, it is a fact of life that there are going to be many similarities of expression among groups people share common cultural and experiencesi copyright is based on the belief that in democracies, anyway, one hundred minds have at least one thousand ways to approach an idea, examine it, voice it.

That belief. does, in a way, make sense, Perhaps get to expressions worked out on machines, however, which ways of working with those expressions, you should be darn careful to make your idea (or the product of it) independent.

In fact, nowadays, what with some sophisticated and computer-literate lawyers, SOURCE code, etc. means, the rule about the imitasuggesting the original in the minds of those · see it IS DARN NEAR DEAD, for computerists anyway: The courts are taking into account Program Structure and Code.

imply Harry Hacker is a multimillion-dollar threat to America because he doesn't like to pay twice to buy a package, once for the office and once for his Home computer, on which he does work he would otherwise be doing at the office.

What's the real story? Greed. Just like they tried to kill Betamaxes and VCRs in general. Just like record companies have tried to persuade the public that if they tape a record in their collection to play in their car, they are starving some poor artist. Buy it, buy it again, they say. Right.

FAIR YOUR USE ONLY...It will anger some to hear the truth being spoken. You bought a program lor record or tape or whatever! that was a commercial product, yours to use, The copyright prohibits you from making copies to sell or give away. It does not say you can't make copies for your own private use, once you bought the original product. Copyright does not say backups are against the law. Copyright does not say that you as the buyer are not entitled to choose when or where you use product you bought; once again, as long as you are not making it available non-private use. In fact, the only thing that says these things are wrong is the software license that the lawyers of the software company drafted in order to intimidate a potential copyright abuser. License is The pre-sale contract with the user. Read it. Don't buy software from stupid companies. Keep in mind that breach of this contract is a civil matter; they may choose to sue you over it. Copyright violations are not the same thing, not at all. Copyright violation is a Felony offense.

Backups and additional private use copies are allowed under the copyright laws due to section them called · USES. Fair written so that people could properly deal with a work, such as in reviewing or using it for private study. Private use means that if the only market you are spoiling through your actions is YOU, and you already bought the work once, no copyright violation exists. Additionally, Fair use means you in no way are competing with the work itself and what you are doing with the work is for educational, non-commercial purposes, such as tracting portions of work for reporting on it events which surround it.

You are NOT allowed to "spoil a market" for someone else. Don't give away copies. Don't sell any copy (including original) and keep any part of the work. Don't republish the work or broadcast it fashion. Co-workers and friends who want a copy should buy it themselves. But if you abide by these things: the government doesn't care it you personally have made 3000 duplicates for Yourself ‹one for each of your phobias?). The software companies see this as practically an INVITATION to pirate, so they don't want you aware of the full law. Guilty until proven innocent.that is the motto of some of the companies.

now that you know.. what about compilers? They help you create your programs, but they do this by stringing together little stored pieces wrote. Can you then Cancodeu hen sell your stand-alone applications program? pieces The Not necessarily. little are integral to the operation of the compiler and they are a part of the compiler's copyright. They are mostly unique to the compiler. Now they are part i of your program, too, which is O.K. since you can use the program yourself: but if creating program to sell, you OBJECT DISTRIBUTION requirements the compiler's creator specifies. Some companies demand royaities on any, program developed with product. My favorite compiler\_ is MIBASIC, by Softaid Inc. Their policy is that you can develop anything you want to and sell it, providing that in the documentation and code of a program you have a credit, such as! "Compiled using MTBASIC. Softaid Inco P.D. Box 2412, Columbia MD 21045", I don't have any objection plugging a fine to tool I like: this object code requirement is the kind of thing I wish every compiler maker would take to heart.

What about magazine listings? IntheHome Computer world, this is a major source of programs. Need I tell you that most all of them are copyrighted? They were virtually all written by users like you and me, who wished to share them with the community of micro users that could be reached through the magazine. Public Domain style. Then the magazine paid them a five-dollar fee, had them sign a form giving them exclusivity: and published it under the magazine's copyright. The magazine

usually has a blurb on the contents page where you would never read it which states, "Material contained herein is the property of HappyHome Computing, Inc. and may not be reproduced in any form without obtaining express written permission from the publisher." Great. Instead of Public Domain, which can 00 onto BulletinBoard. for instance, we have Fair · Use Copyright, which can be typed into YOLI computer but not shared. My feelings on this are that it is not fair, and that it can be licked. The program itself is showing you a Source Algorithi, a solution to a particular problem done up in a language you use on ruining someone's chances doing the work and doing it well enough to earn sometning, even it it's Just recognition, as is mostly the case in home computing. And when you write a program consider the possibility of sharing it with others the Public Domain, which builds a base upon which education and · enlightenment for your computer can grow. Healthy computer communities need people and their programs to show the way. If you copyright you are part of a market that is regulated and pretty secure - now all you need is that skill and idea that will set the computer world on its' ear,

your Now pick up the ball and rewrite the program completely anew. Sure · it is tougher, but the result will be Public Domain. Adapt Commodore listings to your Timex. The resulting code IS NEW CODE. No doubt about it. Your programming skills will be better, too. Change stupid input chains to menus.. write different sort routine. Listings to learn by. anyway. If all you want is something for yourself. it doesn't matter. If you want to share, contribute DRIGINALLY.

And that's what all this copyright stuft is about. It is simply matter of matter of keeping the lazy and the dishonest from Good Luck!

« THIS ARTICLE IS DECLARED SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE DALLAS TIMEX/SINCLAIR AMSTRAD USERS NEWSLETTER, FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEDICATING IT TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IN DOING THIS IS TO INSURE THE EDUCATION OF COMPUTERISTS EVERYWHERE. » - and I wanted to make sure there was at least One example of P.D. available.

## PD Reviews

These will be reviews of some of the public domain utilities available for the Amiga from the Club library or on the MCCC BBS. Most of these programs come with varying amounts of documentation ranging from none at all to those that take eight or ten pages to print out. I will focus on the former and try to give you an idea of what these utilities do The command usage is: and how they may help you.

## PRINT

This program Club BBS in the Utilities Area under the name Printer arc. (I am taking it for granted that Amiga users are familiar with the Arc utility) When Unarced you will have a single file called 'Printer', There is no how-to documentation included with it as it's menu is seltexplanatory. What I have to offer is what results the different settings will give.

## Tim Flynn

name many of you may recognize because he has contributed a number of programs to the Amiga community. It is a Shareware program so your conscience will be your guide on that. My copy of it is version 1.2 so he apparently keeps working on these files to improve them.

Print (filename) (filename) = file to be printed

Once typed, a window will open on can be found on the your screen showing you a number of options i for printing out your file. The first three are Compressed Emphasized and Subscript. Your choices on these are On/Off. They all worked fine through my printer's driver 50 anyone using standard drivers should have no problems (if, of course your printer can handle these modes!)

First I would like to give a little background on the program. It was developed by Bill Beogelein of Detroit: a

The next two · choices are 'Print Dir/Name' and 'Print Date', Select these using the Yes/No gadgets. Print Dir/Name will print the file name at the top center and the directory name one line down on

the left. Print Date puts the system date and time under the directory name.

Finally we get to choose Line Spacing, Skip Over Perfs, and Indent. These require a little explanation, not in how to use them but what you get from them.

Line Spacing: Here you have five selections (.5.1.1.5.2.2.5) The first gadget will give you 8 lines per inch. The rest of them give, in order, 6,4,3 and 2 lines per inch. The default is Skip Over Perfs: This allows you to pick how

much space to leave from the last line one page to the first line on the following page. It will leave 0,2,4.8 or 12 blank lines depending on your choice: Default is 4 but if you use the default Line Spacing I found 8 was easier to work with.

Overall I found this a very useful program as I print out much of the documentation I get with public domain files and with this file in my directory it is always available. The only change that I wish it had was a way to save default changes but since it is a short menu and comes up automatically that is a minor point. I'd rate this an 8.5 out of 10.

Indent: Here again you have five numbers to choose from (0.5.10.15,20) Each number shows the number of spaces each line will be indented. However, this only applies to the beginning of the line! If the entire line cannot fit on an indented line then the remainder is printed at the very beginning of the next line. I used another utility to try things like removing the carriage returns and changing CR's to line feeds but they had no eftect on this apparent bug in the Indent feature.

## Corrections by D. Fuller

COM-LINE, Chula Vista, CA

When typing it in, pay special attention to the double commas and the commas at the end of lines 180, 250 &amp; 240. Miss those commas and the checksum will come out right. but the program will crash.

For you C-128 owners who would like to use the keypad while in 64 mode, the following program will let you do Just that. Load the program after yOu have gone b4 or come-up in 64 mode and run it. The cursor will go away for a beat then BEADY appears. NOW you can type on the keypad and the numbers will appear, and as a bonus, the direction arrows across the top also work in 64 mode.

Computer Jargon (Cont'd from Back Cover)

Syntax - The rules governing how computer program is written -computer programmer.

Real-Time - A Program which executes at the same rate as what it simulates or measures. A program so executing is said to be executing in Real Time. The opposite in non-real time.

CAD - Computer Aided Design - Use computers engineering/drafting. in

CAM - Computer Aid Manufacture Self explanatory.

Cold Start - A computer reset which acts the same as if power were removed. On CBM computers: this returns you to the familiar CBM BASIC Free message. Reset buttons and the C-64 SYS 64120 perform a cold start. Actually, most memory is erased by a cold not start, but the computer resets its pointers and thus "forgets" where things are stored.

Warm Start - A computer reset which preserves the computer memory doesn't reset most pointers). The CBM RESTORE performs a warm start.

Pointer - A computer sign-post: data in memory which points the way to other data.

## The Amiga Library

The MCCC Amiga chapter has a rather extensive library of public domain disks. We currently have about 155 disks (approximately 100 megabytes), and this is growing at a rate of about 6 disks (4 megabytes) per month. The bad news is that trying to find what you need in this mountain of data is not always easy. So this article will attempt to give those brave souls searching for software some guidelines for locating it.

Each disk or volume has a name. This is the name shown 011 the workbench beneath the disk icon. The library is organized around these disk names.

The librarian maintains a master disk which contains one gigantic list containing the file name and description (filenote) of every file in the library. Each entry in this list consists of two lines as follows:

MCCC-A\_040:C/more

This is the filenote attached to the program. The first line is the complete path specification for file/directory. every

The second line which is indented 3 spaces is the filenote attached to the

One way to search this list is to use do this you must get into CLI mode and then issue the command:

›execute searcher,scr

The program will then prompt you for a string to search for. You may use "?" character as a wildcard for any single character or the "*" character as a wildcard for any string of characters. When the program finds a match, it will aiways print out the two lines where the match was found.

One way to view the library is to

(1) Amicus PDS disks: numbers 1 thru 17 (except numbers 4 8 S).

break it up into the four areas:

(2) AmigaLibDisk disks: numbers 1 thru 58 (these are the Fred Fish disks).

(3) MCCC-A club disks: numbers 1 thru 54.

(4) About 25 other disks.

If you are looking for something which might be on one of the Amicus or Fred Fish disks, remember that the contents of these disks are listed every month in the back of Amazing Computing.

## EDUCATION NOTES

The spreadsheet demonstration originally scheduled for the July meeting will be a part of the Metroplex Computer Conference on October 24, There will be a brief introduction to spreadsheets, followed by demonstrations of several spreadsheet programs. In addition, we hope to have informal demos throughout the day, so that those who have questions may get some answers.

At present we have volunteers following spreadsheets: 64. Vizastar for the 64 and 128, Jane for the 128, and Maxiplan for the Amiga. If you would be willing to demonstrate another spreadsheet please call 732-0982.- Mary Louise Hagemeyer

## FORT WORTH CHAPTER NEWS

Our thanks to Bill Leary for demonstrating the Technical Analysis program from Abacus. He showed us how to develop charts of stocks, to aid in making those all-important buy/sell decisions. This appears to be a very useful program for investors.

The Fort Worth Chapter will NOT have a meeting in October. See you all at the Metroplex Computer Conference in Arlington!

## Amiga Chapter News

Rick Schulz

The September meeting featured a demonstration of the many "Hacker's Tools"available to Amiga users. Dave Campbell gave a tine presentation with many usetu! hints: and the chapter thanks him for his efforts.

· As mentioned (numerous times) before, there will be no Thursday night Amiga chapter meeting next month due to the Metroplex Computer Conference, Be there, and be sure to buy at least one raffle ticket (real Amiga users always buy a dozen or more) for the software prizes.

Many of you have perhaps noticed that either our chapter is growing or the Music Room at the Arlington Community Center is shrinking. Let me assure that based on painstaking measurements and experiments over the past several months, 1 can say with complete confidence that the room is not shrinking. Our chapter (at last count 118) is the fastest growing chapter in the club. While this gives us more leverage and ability to provide quality programs, it also poses new problems. Foremost among them is the accommodations we are presently using. In the past, it was possible for some of the members to gather in the back of the room for quiet conversation while the presentation was being conducted. This is to be expected: not everyone will be interested in the topic presented. However, as the chapter has grown so has the number of people who gather at the back during the presentation, and with them their noise level. Out of common courtesy to the speaker and his audience, we must remember to speak softly and carry a big chip (or something like that). Your chapter officers recognize this probiem and realize that a better solution is required, and they are working on this problem (no doubt even as I write these very words!). In the interim, your help is needed, so please heip out and hush up!

By now you have received a mailer from Commodore detailing their latest offer on Aliga 2000's. No doubt you have also heard that dealer will sell you an Aliga 2000 for only $1000 and your old (?) Amiga 100D. Such a deal you say! How could it possibly be better: ask. Well, if you were at the September chapter meeting, you heard a better deal. And if you weren't hop in your car and drive right over to Software Terminal and ask Richard Bilyea about his FABULOUS, TOO-GOOD-TO-BETRUE deal on Amiga 2000's. (Yes, do it right now! Don't even finish reading the newsletter. Hurry up!) Or call him on the telephone, and he'll say "Such a deal I got for you!", or words to that effect. This offer is so good l can't even put it into print. Check it out!

## Computer Jargon Brian Heyboer Greater Omaha CUG

Well, here I am again with another collection of computer jargon. This time, I have a general selection. As always, this is more of a dictionary than tutorial, intended as a reference when reading other computer related writings.

Bug - A bug 15 a tault, something that makes the hardware or software not function correctly, It is used more often to describe software faults. Programs which don't work right are "buggy". It is said that the term goes back to the days of relay-controlled logic, when moth in a relay cause a malfunction. Thus, a "bug" in the system.

Debug - To find and correct bugs,

Bomb - To stop functioning (esp. software), usually in a non-recoverable way.

Crash - See bomb. (Notice there are lots of words for it.)

Lock-Up - A bomb so great that nothing on the computer responds (no keyboard, no changes on the screen, nothing).

Patch - A correction to a computer program which is separate from original. Often a Machine Code correction a compiled program.

## MOCC NEWS

Mid-Cities Commodore Club Post Office Box 1578 Bedford, Texas 76021

## Address Correction Requested

Kludge - (pronounced with a long ul An inelegant patch, usually one which seems like it shouldn't work: but does. A software Rube Goldberg.

Trojan Horse - A program which is designed with a destructive purpose in mind (like erasing your disk) usually disguised as a useful program. Note: Most destructive with a hard disk based system (erasing megabytes): but Commodores are not immune.

VIrus - A program sular to a trojan Horse, but which "infects" other programs with the same destructive nature. NOTE: Because Commodore computers don't use a disk-loaded operating system (which is usually the virus' "carrier"), it is more immune to this type program than other computers. A copy program or fast load utility, though, could be used for this purpose, Always 1ook a "gift horse" program in the mouth.

Worn - Another type of destructive program, one which eats away from the inside and wreaks its destruction after a number of uses (sort of a time bomb). Same note as above applies.

WORM - Write Once Read Multiple - A type of memory device (especially optical disk) which can be written to only once but read a number of times.

Keywords - The words in a computer language. Like PRINI, READ, eto in BASIC (Cont'd on Page 13)
