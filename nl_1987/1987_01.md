## The New MCCC BBS

MCCOWExecutive now most of you probably know that Committee recommend a new Bulletin Board system for because similar proposing has been available to club a no-cost. trial basis since the Christmas party. What may not be quite however, the additional expense. After have a Bulletin Board the needs of seems to be meetingfact even better. improvements to make Lete going have been asked to write this article to try and explain the whys and wherefores. Here it is.

There OK? So much for the financial reasons. ·a more important reason least so far as I and the rest of the BBS committee is concerned: A great many of You Mid-citres Comodore clearspilt Inen the Mid-Cities Prior to time, the entire size was It was come into the room many people noticed. I know was one of those people. That problem Still exists of course, but not to the same extent because none of our meetings are that large any more. And that was the reason behind the be done? Quarterly meetings represent a long drive for a lot people and many have already attended meeting the month. Quarterl meetings are still a good idea but they getting the job about a place where everyone could talk ow everyone else without having miles? How about a Bulletin Board system available additiona, to all club members fee) regardless ofat. computer they are using! And how message base where messages don't in a week or two?

First, our club is undergoing change. signiticant membership growth in C128 users. In order to remain a vital healthy organization, membership computers. In order to do this to provide whatever services we can to owners of all Commodore equipment. according constitution and it is also west-being. It is able alub a necesnancial tinancial · due to our services to our membership which we have thus far been able to provide at a reasonable cost. We therefore need to provide kinds of possible. One , things to provide is which will allow our members full use of their computers.

club's move to split into chapters attempt to to provide a more atmosphere ree more at home derive more from For the undesirable it worked. But it did have an side-effect. When we chapters, split the membership more than we anticipated. What we have now sitter about what is going on Going on to ang of the other chapters. constitution provides for quarterly meetings where the actually happens most Togetherlime is that only the local membership attends. Think Grand Prairie mapter know ayone in the Grand Prairie 'ort worth Chapter! And does invthing at al Maybe you don't care? You should. Because benefit. we we have one important talented - talent that can cross over from E128 to Amiga to C64 if the communication outside opened. normally attend meetings chapter Problem people are. There could be a great benefit to everyone whose celet there were way to make s talents available to the

One more reason. If it would be great get the entire club talking to each other - learning from each other - just think how great it would be to extend that across country. One of the goals of the new BBS system will be to become part of a nationwide network of Bulletin Board systems where the messages you post will show up around the country and where you

will have messages posted other cities. mean that it will be an available only but messages can be bundled out overnight. approvert our will look for or initiate required. The things we new BBS is are talking locally and nationwide are just not we now have. But want to insure that the new system will be expandable and upgradeable in future so that we won't have tos on a humber sore eskin for another

· coupie oI stressed toe addition an - and I'd better the new BBS 1l1 be just that - an addition. It wil. not replace the existing BBS. The curren system is excellent one and S4 capabilities which are un ike Py vo, es carmittee annasther system, The executive committee intention discontinuing it. We are, in fact, in the improved systen readine inta bed it risk of being redundant, some of the major improvements tripling of available disk space allowing for larger download addition of 1200 BAUD, and an easier way to access member names.

oint: the new BBs ill be available to all BBS members. The $12 annual fee will cover membership to both BBS systems and will be sufficient to adequate operating budget Ior both. Ihis is an important point eparate fees would cause just the kind o1 ragmentation withın the club that the new is being designed to correct.

What kind of about? We will neeystem are we talking an Amiga, floppy drive, monitor, modem (2400 configuration allow us to grow or to change as new needs future. computer automatically be able any new computer which Commodore may throw at us. even be able to additional replacing equipment should that become necessary in much will it cost?

It is a big expense - the largest since the purchase approved it has the potential of being important to the future of the club.

## Fastload Cautions

## Syntax Error, Orange, CA

If you use programs that utilize REL Illes, then Basteads should is me ised hy Fastloads should not behint ony these cartridges de reasonore ehind why these cartridges the 1541 drive has five buffers. These buffers are used to transfer information on a diskette to either the internals of the disk drive or computer. One buffer is for the disk drive to keep track of what is where on the diskette(Block Availability Map BAM). The other four are used to transfer blocks of data computer (in cases). A REL file requires three buffers leaves only one buffer free. cartridges will use these buffers without checking chemainy the disk drive wi, see this and try to work around the cartridge. Now if the cartridge two buffers buffer. corrupted BAM diskette scramble the time you slow and to it. This scramblink is not noticed until is often FASTLOAD It, is recommended you not TYPE cartridges

If you have a diskette which has been corrupted FASTLOAD, or reason, the data can be saved by y following these steps:

- a backup copy of the data disk scratss ble
- Validate diskette according instructions in disk drive manual.
- files off the data disk except those ending in REL and HDR.
- instructions in manual on creating a sequential file.
- a printout of the old record
- a printout of the field list, so you know the field length.
- Read the sequential file format, then sequential
