Local Programmer Produces Sensational Software

## TELEGAMES by Scott Lamb

Review by Barbara Cramer

"TeleGames is what you've waited for. The Future is here.

A little presumptuous, wouldn't you say? Probably just an example of twentieth century advertising 'hype", but, wait a minute. I can play backgammon, chess or checkers with a real, live person on the other end of the phone. I can hold a lengthy conversation with him throughout the game, calling him names and distracting his attention whenever necessary. Look. My family is coming in to join in the fun. A crowd is gathering around my computer. I'm not alone anymore…..

TeleGames is a powerful piece of telecommunications software which will allow you to play chess, checkers or backgammon with a human opponent while offering you all the conversational conviences of being in the same room. The features of this program are so numerous, it's hard to know where to begin.

This scenario is certainly an exaggeration, but TeleGames is the first piece of software to bring computerists together in real time for the purpose of having fun without sacrificing the comforts of home. Forget the bean dip and hair curlers. Now you can have a party with the Nelson's in your pajamas on the spur of the moment.

## THE GAMES

TeleGames is designed for the Amiga with 512K of memory and is totally intuition driven. The screen displays and clear and artistically attractive having been drawn in medium resolution rather than the usual low resolution mode. Over 75% of the program is devoted to graphics and animation and the results are exceptionally smooth. For example, when you pick up a piece, it will move around the screen with your cursor until you release the left mouse button to place it on the board. Activities such as castling, crowning, bearing off and rolling the dice are automatic and smoothly animated. Digital sounds are also used to create a realistic 'feel' to the games.

At any time during the game, you are allowed to change the perspective of the screen display which is totally independent from your partner's display. There are both two and three dimensional representations as well as options from any of the four sides. The rules which govern all games have been taken from Hoyle's Rules of Games, 1983 and a good description of play and scoring has been included in the manual. The program will not allow you to cheat nor will it allow an illegal move. Just plain stupid moves are your own problem.

Many of you will remember Bob's regular column in the newsletter entitled "Programmer's Corner." We are all very saddened by his passing.

## TELEGAMES (continued)

Games may be saved to disk at any time durinet calawaiting interpaptis ularly connection just as you were making your final attack on the enemy. It is also useful for long chess games when your family insists you be present for last night's pot roast. The TG Game Files allow you to store up to 32 games for transmission and completion at a later date.

## THE PROGRAM

Playing the games is certainly fun, but the programmer, Scott Lamb, has provided us with the ability to talk to each other during the game. Located at the bottom of the screen are two conversation boxes which may be used to send and receive messages at any time, in any game. Not only does this perk up the boring moments waiting for your opponent to decide strategy, it makes the game more realistic, as if you were both in the same room. A pleasant bell rings whenever your opponent sends a message and the message remains on the screen until a new one is sent. Sentences of more than 74 characters will automatically be sent when your typing reaches the end of a line. As long as your partner can read faster than you type, long messages are no problem.

TeleGames is convient. Graphics and telecommunication files may be copied to

RAM for faster access if you have additional memory. Telegames may also be placed on your hard disk drive. Icon driven utility programs and instructions are included to make these tasks effortless.

The program takes a little longer to load initially so that on-line game changes will be as short as possible. The TeleGames disk is not copy protected so you may use back-up copies for everyday purposes.

TeleGames is fully multi-tasking, an essential for those long waits between chess moves. Write a letter to grandma or a thrilling short story when your opponent's conversation slows down.

Telegames is fast. Each computer alternates being master and servant. In a test using two machines sitting side by side, set at 1200 baud, there was less than a one second delay in transmitting data, moves and messages, from one machine to the other.

To test Telegames ability to handle multitasking, I printed all 16 pages of the newsletter this month using PageSetter' Page Print while playing checkers across town with TG's publisher, Rick Bilyea. What used to represent two evenings of boredom watching the pixels print has now been transformed into a pleasant pastime.

While TeleGames uses a very large amount of memory, priorities have been reassigned in the games to provide for fast

and smooth movement of windows and game pieces. This is especially noticeable when printing a document; priorities are taken from the printing task and assigned to the game for the short amount of time needed to move a game piece. Printing then resumes at the normal speed while waiting for your partner' s move. Clever, eh?

## THE PARAMETERS

TeleGames is com-patible with any modem and may be set to 300, 1200, 2400 or 9600 baud.

Naturally, both computers must be set at the same rate. You may set the computer to answer or originate the call or you may that when your friends see TeleGames in choose the Null Modem Connect option - one computer mode.

a hard disk as well as a troubleshooting guide and advice on customizing the mouse pointer.

## USER SUPPORT

So what do you do with all these features if you can't find someone to challenge?

Rick Bilyea, publisher of TeleGames and owner of Software Terminal, has added a special section to the Track II BBS he operates in Ft. Worth, Texas. Registered owners are automatically added to the BBS roster allowing 24 hour access to messages from other TG owners. Chances are good

The feature I like most is the fact that it brings people together, not just computers.

operation, you won't have to look for a partner.

A phone directory is available with 32 entries enabling you to personalize your disk with the names, numbers and specific parameter information of all your friends. A creator, look for partners, leave suggestions games directory is also available for keeping or just read the comments. track of 32 games-in-progress. All features are menu driven, fast and easy to use.

## THE MANUAL

There' s no such thing as a perfect software package. Every software publisher is forced to take precautions against pirates. It's unfortunate but realistic. In order to prevent duplication, the manual has been printed in light aqua ink making it difficult to read. Get out your reading glasses, granny! If you are lucky enough to get one of the first 1000 copies, you will have the added challenge of reading ink that was printed even lighter than the publisher intended. Ah, the joys of sub-contracting the work load.

The 40 page manual does contain a good deal of useful and supportive information. Besides the basic instructions for using each feature and menu, you are given the rules of each game and specific instructions on teleconnect procedure. Additional information is supplied for using a RAM disk,

## CONCLUSIONS

Both a message base and file transfer area have been created on Track Il to meet your needs. Talk with Scott Lamb, TG's

Above all, check the file area for updates and program improvements. As the need for program changes occurs, files will be made available to all registered owners for free downloading. You will even find one waiting there now.

I have seldom reviewed a program with as many high marks as this one. TeleGames actually does what it boasts, a rarity in any product. If only my word processor would do as much!

The feature 1 like most is the fact that it brings people together... not just computers.

TeleGames retails for $ 34.95. (Ask Rick for the club discount and be prepared to show your membership card.)

## Kevin Hisel C.P.U. Connection

I was recently lucky enough to have one of CBM's 'yet to be released' 1581 drives, so I coud re-write Disk Doctor 128, now available on Q-Link. While I had my hot little paws on this mini-marvel, I did some time trials.

Please note that the drive may still undergo some ROM changes before it hits the streets and these specifications are preliminary. All loading and saving times performed with the 99 block version of John O'Hare's Monopole. The times were averaged between three tries so they should be fairly accurate. Validation was based on 600 allocated blocks.

Undocumented Commands for Easier Use

## SCRIBBLE! - DOT COMMANDS

Robert Arnesen - C.C.C.C., Tucson, AZ

I've had Scribble! for some time but until recently hadn't paid much attention to it's Dot Command capabilities. It quickly became apparent that, as 1s usual with manuals, there 15

- some disagreement with the manual as to the way in which these commands can be included in files,
- bì no real information as to how to construct a format file to include data on how to set up your printer to autoconfigure when you bring the program up.

On pages 2-36 of the manual, it is noted that the formatting commands showd be preceded by a period and that several of them can be placed on one line as long as they are seperated by commas. It would appear, then, that they should · be written:

## ,PO=xx,.LM=xx,(etc.)

Wrong! The only period used should be the first one and all the rest of them on the same line should not have periods. The examples on pages 228 are shown correctly. This is something of an inconsistency and MicroSystems Sottware will clarity this in their next manual.

Printer Control Commands are also dot commands, that 15, they are preceded by dots and it is only nafural that one would assume that they work in the same way. They, don't! They can only be typed in columnar form. For instance: .#0/0-%27[6w #1/0-227auded print on (Expanded print off) .#2/0-%2712v (Superscript on)

These can be placed at the beginning of your file and i and then Y typing ALT/G and then to turn the expanded print on when you want to turn it off then al you . need to do is type ALT/G and then 1. Only ten such commands can be accomodated 50 the numbers following the pound sign can run from # Sign identifies the code as one that will follow an ALT/G command, following number is the command number, the /0 that it is a nonprinting command, the percent sion indicates that the following number i5 a decimal and the 27 , of course, the ESCape code which must always precede printer command code. These latter are Amiga codes not the printer codes particwar .. yOur machine. You will them listed starting on 2-31 of Scribble! manual Some of them may not work on your machine - for instance, mine is an Epson FX-80 and doesn't know beans about Shadow Print. So you will have to check yours out.

Now, about .fmt files. What you should do printer commands you Printere type in all the want to use in a column, remember, then go to the Default column and set the Top, Bottom and Offset margins you want the machine to normally use. vext co to tne Archive function in the Default column and · when window comes up, click in the selection line and the title include the \_apostrophes and Store it. This will save · the file under 'SYS: heading and it be read every, time the program is invoked.

Modifying this file is a bit of a problem because it is evidently compiled 5o you can not call it up and re-type of it since it can not be read. What you will have to do is to get it again and re-type the commands entirely, including whatever changes you wisn to lake, and re-save it. Fron then commands on, those will be ¡vallabie tor your u5l any text fhat yor write. If you have special purposes for which need can save them format different name and 'Get' it before typing text. Just remember that you çan not use both sets in the same text file.

Micro-Systems has also promised to improve their coverage of this subject in their new manual. That's great, but who wants to wait for it?

We've all seen the page layout advertising Writer's Workshop. The headers, footers, double columns and graphics pasted everywhere in the document! Well it ain't so folks.

ALL Geowrite applications alloud) You can have margins set most anywhere on the page, 10 to 70, 5 to 40, 40 to 70 and etc. But there can only be ONE\_set of margins per page. The text column can use all the page, the center, the right side or the left, BUT NOT more than one column per page. Headers and footers are supported, as is justification of text.

## 1520 + PRINTER Mack J Biederman COD

One afternoon, about three months ago, I had a phone conversation with a noted friend who, amongst other bits of information, mentioned that a 1520 Color Printer Plotter was available at a local emporium for a very modest sun.

Everything worked fine, except that I couldn't use my primary printer without disconnecting the 1520 from my computer system. I also couldn't use the 1520 without disconnecting the Gemini printer...

Feeling that I couldn't live without a 1520 CPP, I rushed down to the store and purchased One. Hurried back to the house. hooked it up and typed in a few of the programs listed in the manual.

At our June Meeting the CHELSEA COMPUTER ACCESSORIES shop had a table set up in the rear of the room. The young representative happened to mention that he made up special orders of ports for peripherals. Inquiry disclosed that he could make up a box with one input and three output ports. I special ordered one and it finally arrived.

plugged the 1520 and Gemini into the front of the box. Lo and behold!! The 1520 and Gemini worked beautifully, with both switched on, or either one switched separately.

## THE CASE OF THE MURDERED DISKS

## David Higgowitz

If you are a murder mystery buff then you will appreciate the suspense and intrigue surrounding the recent serial murders of a number of 5 1/4 inch floppys in the Southern California area As early as October scattered reports began to appear in the local bulletin boards. It seemed as if one of the most used and yet least paidfor telecommunications utilities had gone berserk. The reports vared in detail as to the method in which the disks were slain but the instrument was always the same - a well liked program caled LYNX.

Then to everyone's surprise there came a much different sibling. The friends of Papa LYNX all thought that this child would be called Y8 just as its brothers had been called Y2 through Y7. Why would Papa LYNX call this one 108? Many BBS users suspected that LYNX 108 waS "different" from the very · beginning. All the other little LYNX5 worked alone, but 108 refused to work unless accompanied by two elf-ike machine language programs. Little did the computer community know

## Comm'Putoy Cult

Vatican was created by an exploding paint truck - not very likely, to say the least.

Then what should have been the joyful birth of yet another little LYNX turned to sadness. Was this another cruel joke from Papa LYNX? Y9 Was snubbed, ignored, feared, and scratched. A number of technicians began performing lobotomies of Y9, changing an ominous looking command "NO:BOOT" to a harmless "I0:B00T".

What was even more sad was the expression of anger toward Papa LYNX. This could not have happened at a worse time. He had never made more than a pittance for the work that he and his children had performed during the previous twelve months. He had pinned a note to his youngest child, Y9, pleading for some kind of remuneration for the work they were doing Now some of the users were openly scorning his pleas for help. They said, "Why should we send any support to a deliberately formatted our disks?"

Some users ralled to the support of Papa LYNX. Others said, "GUILTY AS CHARGED* · This reporter determined to give Papa LYNX an opportunity to defend himself against the circumstantial evidence being gathered against him Eager to clear his name, he immediately responded to our inquiries. Here is part of Papa LYNX'S answer to the charges:

Papa LYNX had travelled to Southern California via AT&amp;T in November of 1985 and settled in to stay. He had been welcomed by the computer community and, as most good programs do, he began to propagate and by September 1986 there were seven new generations of LYNX, due the short gestation period of the scratched or formatted. progra

## DISSOLVING FILES

## Jim Kaminski SC Cubed, Sacramento, CA

The phrase "dissolving files" is not just another way of describing the erasing or scratching of files. Instead, it may refer to the "de-compiling" of files which were compiled by others. Now that you are totally confused, let u5 see if we can make some sense out of this.

In many instances it takes more than one file to make an application program work, For instance, a word processing program might have the program itself, a spelling checker, and a printer routine. There might also be a separate program to customize the program colors, and another program to edit the dictionary. If you were the jury must address is the form of protection used in the file to preserve the byline and author's message. Did Papa have the right to put such an algorithm in his program or was it overkil? Your answer will probably depend on whether you are a pirate or a responsible user. There is a price to be paid for all our sins. Some apparently have begun to pay the price!

Any inquiries regarding the LYNX and the murdered disks should be addressed to Papa LYNX, c/o Will Corley, 7551 Twilight Drive, Sacramento CA. 95822.

are Remember, whether you user ог a programmer, ano you think you're being ripped oft don't just sit there and take it! FIGHT BACK WITH HIGGOWITZ.

copying these programs from one disk to another, you must be careful to get all of them, and hopefully not also copy the last report you wrote If you switch to another word processor, and then a year from now have to go back and edit a file with the old program, you might not remember all of the files which are required to operate that old And the needed file might be on that old disk that was reused two months ago.

Or take another example. You want to transfer programs to and from a bulletin board or a friend. How do you 1) ensure that all of the needed files are transferred, 2› ensure that each file 15 properly named so that, if needed, one program can properly another without error, 3) minimize the keystrokes required during the transfer (thus reducing the possibility of error), 4) reduce the amount of time needed to make the transfer, and 5) possibly minimize the amount of disk space used. One answer to all of these concerns is to use a file compiler or file archiver.

For Commodore computers there are three common file compiler standards being used today: Library, Lynx, and ARC. None of them are commercial productsi Library 15 in the public domain and the others are considered shareware. They all have the ability to specified group of files and tie them together somehow into just one file. Thus only one file must be copied from disk to disk or via telecommunications. The compiled file Can then be broken apart into the individual files at its

The current version is Library files have a suffix of Ibr, Lynx X, although Lynx IX might be Lynx files use Inx, and ARC files preferable. It appears that Lynx was have arc on the end. upgraded to avoid some problems created by certain terminal programs and when using the XMODEM transfer protocol. However, in doing so the program became an orphan: Lynx IX will dissolve Lynx X files, but not the other way around. Lynx also has colorful history, having been used, abused, copy-protected, and considered as both tollware and shareware Text files are around which explain the various sides to the "Lynxgate" issue.

Lynx came out next (late 1985). Its method of linking files involves editing the track and sector links of the selected programs so that the DOS believes that only one huge file exists It too has a contents section which retains information on the original files. Since Lynx does not actually write out each file, it is faster than Library, but it has the disadvantage of working on only 1541 drives {or ones which are VERY compatible). Generally it 15 limited only by disk space (168K) and can compile or dissolve an entire disk at one time. It

ARC is an abbreviation of archive, which is the name of a file compiler first developed for IBM PC-type computers. However, the Commodore version of ARC is much more than a file compiler It is actually a type of operating system which as some of the functions and also the "feel" of MS-DOS used by the IBM-type computers. ARC includes a simple text editor and allows for moving files between drives, identification of drives by a letter prefix (ai, bi, etc.), the listing of sequential files by the command TYPE, and 50 forth. The fact it can both combine and compress files is just a sample of ARC'5 many features. ARC supports most all drives for the C-b4, including IEEE drives (SFD, etc.) and mutiple drives through device number it, It is not as fast as Lynx because like Library, must both read and write each of the selected files. The current version is 2.30 and is the most bug-free effort to date. Some of the

It appears that Library was the first compiler available (mid 1985). It generally uses BASIC to read each file and then write it to the compiled file, one file after another, but only after writing an overall contents section first (containing the original file names and lengths). This means that the process is slow, but that it can work with any type of disk drive. The most bug-free is version 5.2 (although versions 7, 8.5, and 9 do exist, they have many programming errors when multiple drives are used, and their encoding precludes easy corrections). Because Library is used with a second space, 1.2M on the SFD. Except in unusual cases, Library does NOT Shorten the disk space used by the files.

earlier features (such as encryption) have been removed, but in general the version can handle files combined under earlier versions. The size savings ot ARl-compressed fles 15 impressive a text fle was changed Trom 1b4 blocks in length to a mere 62 blocks by crunching.

ARC also has a disadvantage when compared with the other programs in that it is NOT menu driven: each action is controlled by typing a specific command such as:

## arc/c ctext.arc artext

This will compress the file named "text" on drive 0 of device 8 into a file named "text.arc" on drive 0 of device 9. ARC also has problems with the use of spaces file names because of the way it interprets its commands. However, there is another set of programs called ARCAID (version 6 is the latest) which act as a shell to provide a menu selection of ARC's commands. Furthermore, one of these programs includes an option to produce an ARC-type file which loads like a normal BASIC program and creates the reqwred fles on disk when the RUN command is typed. These types of files are known as SDA (Self-dissolving ARC) files.

For those who do not wish to use ARC, another\_ option exists for reducing the length of a file. SQ and USQ are a pair of programs which squeeze and un squeeze files to reduce their length. First made available in late 1985, current version is 2.0 and files squeezed by this method can be recognized by a prefix of q/ in the name file. The 164 block text file was squeezed down to 76 blocks by this program. 5Q and USQ work with virtually all disk drives and are limited only by disk space.

There are probably other methods available for this method of file manipulation, but the above are commonly used techniques. These file compilers are not generally known of by non-telecommunicators, but hopefully this article will help to change that, allowing more computer users to "dissolve files."

## SUPER SNAPSHOT

## Review by Bob Lindstrom

## Quantumlink

Ever since the windfall success of Epyx's Fastload, manufacturers of utility cartridges for the C-b4 have been trying to outdo each other by cramming more and more features into those little black boxes. Fast loaders, machine language monitors, Centronics ports, menu programs eventually all C-64 owners may oun a utility cartridge about the size of a Subaru that has everything up to and including your lunch menu for July 27, 204б. LMS Technologies of Canada and Kracker Jax of the USA have put their heads together and come up with Super Snapshot (SS), a utility cartridge that includes a fast loader, a DOS wedge, a screen dump utility, a machine language monitor and a memory capture utilty.

Super Snapshot plugs into the cartridge port on the C-64 and the C-128. Like the other C-64 utility cartridges on the market, S5 locks out the C-128 mode

Super Snapshot Continued...

and will have to be removed from C-128's when you want to use the 128 side of your computer.

Since the features of SS all work well, a simple description of them should suffice here.

When you first turn on your C-64, SS intervenes and places a menu on-screen which provides access to its many features. Incuded is the option to lock out the S5 in order to boot programs that will not load with the cartridge in place ( found VERY few. When you are in BASIC, In BASIC pressing a small button on the cartridge returns you to the 55 menus.

The DOS wedge provides single keystroke alternatives for common commands:

$ - list directory / - load BASIC program % - Load machine language program › or ' - OPEN or CLOSE disk I/O ›*8/9 - change boot drive ›TD - disable fast load (Turbo DOS) ›TE - enable fast load › - disable DOS wedge

The Code Inspector #2 machine language montor allows users to break into any program running on the C-64 and look at memory. The monitor incorporates such commands as disassemble, assemble, memory modify, compare and many others.

As convenient as the above features are, most users will use (or misuse) the Snapshot capabilities of S5. Compared to other memory capture utilities that have been released for the C-b4, s5 is fast and extremely easy to use. In most cases, you'll load a program, press the button on the 95 cartridge, tell it to Capture the memory, Till in a tew filenames and (in about three minutes) you have an umprotected copy of the program in disk files. A software user's dream, a software developer's nightmare.

The Photo-Copy screen dump sends any high resolution or text screen to your rather small but well reproduced, Photousin picture toas Copy will not dump screens of redefined graphic characters. That feature is planned for a ROM upgrade to SS.

However, though it could be a boon to piracy, S5 does have legitimate uses. Anyone who has waited minutes to load a copy-protected program will recognize the value of having the program in unprotected disk file. I have used SS on several of my programs just to pick up the increase in boot speed which the files allow. And a recent shipment of cassette-based game software from Europe was moved conveniently to disk with the help of my 5S.

For those programs that cannot be copied with SS, the package includes a Kracker Jax disk with сору parameters. This will make the package more attractive to many users.But frankly, the presence of the Kracker Jax disk puts peculiar emphasis on the copying aspects of SS.

I found SS to be a powerhouse memory capture tool My success rate has been 80 percent or better. But be aware of this warning. Like all memory capture utilities, 55 works only with programs that load completely into memory and do not employ part of the disk drive memory to store the program. It may be possible to snapshot programs that access the disk but it will be necessary to have your original program disk in the drive at all times.

There's no need to be coy here. Many people are going to use this cartridge to steal commercial software. Adding the Kracker Jax disk only underlines the clandestine capabilities of the cartridge. Hint, hint, nudge, no more. And its a sneaky nudge, 5a nook folks on the kracker way to Jax series.

Super Snapshot is available in the USA for $ 49.95 from:

Nonetheless, whether your motives are murky as a swamp or pure as molten silicon, Super Snapshot is excellent product Sustamp on motives and an invaluable utility in the day to day use of your C-64/C-128. I recommend it.
