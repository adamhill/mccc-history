## Rattigen Out as Commodore CEO, Gould Takes Over Reins

## Western Indiana Commodore Users

If you purchased the May issue of Commodore magazine for the interview with Commodore CEO Thomas Rattigan: issue of RUN for the same with General same with denera Manager Nigel Shepherd, you might as well toss them both into the hopper. Neither Rattigan nor Sheperd work for Commodore anymore. the guy who originally bankrolled Jack Tramiel's move calculators to computers, Irving Gould, is now the CEO of Commodore.

Why, why, why?

That's right, April 14-22 was Commodore's bi-annual Dump the Executives Week. Besides the two aforementioned executives, Irving Gould - Commodore's Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder at 19.5%, has fired 48 other exec types and office workers at Commodore's West Chester, PA headquarters,

At first hearing, this may sound like the traditional Commodore foot-shot taken to the knee level or higher. Rattigan has been generally touted as the oug wño nas taker commodore from a dismal six quarters o losses to four straight of profits (albeit small ones); Ergo, Rattigan is a victim and Gould must be insane, right?

But there around about Rattigan that peg him as having something less than Commodore's best interest at heart. What is known for sure is that he has "involuntarily" resigned, that he was physically removed from West Chester facility and that Rattigan is suing Commodore for 59 million.

## Profits Up, Products Late

The big story over the last year for Commodore has been its seeming revival. There are the four profitable quarters in a row.

There are the slew of new product announcements: the Amiga 500 and : 2808, the C-64C, the 128D, the 1581 disk drive, the RAM mouses, etc. Add to that the phenomenal continued sales of the 64 and now the 128 - the first and fourth most popular computers world representing 83% of Commodore's revenue.

But looking deeper into the story brings some interesting details to light. first of all, about 79% of Commodore's revenues haxe been coming from their overseas operations. chiefly Europe, Australia and Canada. Ir fact, over the past two years, Commodore sales in the U.S. have declined 5.4% - figures courtesy of BUSINESS WEEK, May 11, 1987,

Through it all, Thomas Rattigan, the · Harvard graduate and former Pepsico whiz kid, has generally been given credit in the press for the turnaround.

Second, virtually all of the new products have suffered delays in their releases. unknown at Commodore before, but it seems like EVERY new product is hitting the market like molasses these days: Most notorious have been the Sidecar and Genlock for the Amiga and the 1764 RAM expander for the 64.

Fourth, there has been the mystery of the missing so-called Amiga RANGER. Most Amiga watchers expected the A-2008 to be a super enhanced version with a full 32-bit architecture competitive with the new MAC II and the IBM AT/386 machines. Instead it turned out to be just an A-1008 with the operating system in ROM and internal slots. Add to that disappointment the lingering bad vibes over the ham-handed disabandonment of the original Amiga development team at Los Gatos.

Third, Rattigan is supposed to be something of a marketing whiz, but, under him there have been no sustained major media marketing efforts on behalf of any of the Commodore machines in the U.S. The few Amiga commercials were inane, when not entirely incomprehensible. And the 128 bits seemed to be mainly targeted at punk rockers and people upgrading from the C-64.

Naturally, some are going to look at those four profitable quarters (slim as they were) continued on page 2...

## Gould Takes Over, continued...

and still say Hattigan brought commodore back. But others will not fail to note that many Commodore watchers have come to see the sucess of the 64, the 128 and the Amiga as continuing IN SPITE Of anything Commodore managementhas done and not as the result.

There is more - the details and rumors surrounding the details of the actual removal of Rattigan, Shepherd, Brennen (Vice-President of Software.. what software? Yep, that's the guy) and others.

## The Events

FACT: On April 14th, there was a meeting of the board in which Rattigan complained about the use of outside consultants and other actions which had diminished his role as CEO (Chief Executive Officer).

FACT: On April 15th representatives Dillon, Read &amp; Co. told Nigel Shepherd (Commodore's North American General Manager) that his four-person finance staff was being dismissed. He challanged their authority to do so and said he would take the matter up with Rattigan.

???: Rattigan claims he called the meeting, Gould claims Rattigan attended uninvited.

???: Apparently the Dillon, Read reps had any standing at Commodore and wanted Later that day, Shepherd met Rattigan in a hallway and relayed the discussion, for which he was himself fired.

FACT: On April 16th, Rattigan was officially suspended by Commodore pending 3 board meeting to consider his termination for "cause"

???: "Cause" means that Rattigan failed to fulfill the terms of his contract which had recently been renegotiated to run until 1991 and was worth about $9 million, It gives Commodore the right to avoid paying the contract off.

FACT: On April Z8th, Rattigan was escorted off the West Chester property by Commodore guards. Then two days after, he submitted an "involuntary resignation" to Commodore and filed a 59 million lawsuit against them.

## Behind the Events

Gould is openly claiming that Commodore's and Rattigan's performance in the U.S. market has been unacoeptable, He was quoted in Bussiness Week as saying that "The U.S, operation should be a sales and marketing company, not an administrative monster, which he apparently thinks it is. Other that Gould is upset about the amount of time it has taken to get new products like the Amiga and PC-10 to the U.S. market, the uncompetitively high prices (especially the Amiga) and disbanding of the Amiga development staff before the 32-bit version of the Amiga had been readied for market.

the Philadelphia Inquirer) and the grapevine's (from the Amiga section of GEnie), Rattigan, pending his lawsuit, isn't talking.

Shepherd's version, on the other hand, paints Gould as a man with a personality conflict with Rattigan. He claims that "Irving absolutely flipped" when Rattigan's picture appeared on the cover of Commodore Magazine. He further argues that the turnaround at Commodore had already been dramatic, that Gould's new firings will only save about $1.5 million a year and that Commodore's staff for servicing retailers and software suppliers is already stripped to the bone.

Turning greyer, another strain of the rumor claims that Rattigan (and friends) were trying to manipulate Commodore's stock market prices down as part of an attempt to stage a stock takeover of Commodore, Gould evidently did fire some execs without Rattigan's knowledge or approval, and, apparently was trying to undercut Rattigan's control as CEO all in an effort to curtail the takeover scheme, According to this rumor, during the April 14th board meeting, Rattigan actually tried to carry out the takeoyer in a last ditch effort, but his support base had aleady been eroded and it failed.

Those are the events but they still leave the question, Why?, unanswered. Did Irving Gould and others move to undercut Rattigan's authority? What was the cause that prompted these actions? Right now there are three available versions: Gould's, Shepherd's (from with irony, he, too, was hired for his Business Week, the Wall Street Journal and

So that leaves the grapevine's version. The picture that it paints of Rattigan ranges from medium grey to pitch black and maybe then The approach cripples Commodore's future possibly its survival - but Rattigan takes home a "well-earned" paycheck for the black ink on the bottom line.

Then the rumor turns black. It may only be coincidental, but back at Pepsico, Rattigan happened to be associated with · another ambitious executive type who went by the name of John Sculley. In case that name doesn't ring a bell, Sculley is the head honcho of Apple Computers, In 3 scenario dripping professional management skill - to help Apple

make the transition from an overachieving computer company run by hackers to a sophisticated fortune 508 company, In the process, Sculley just happened to blow Apple's co-founder and Next, Inc. and take over as head of Apple himself. Nice work if you can get it.

Or, blackest of all black thoughts, did the two heads come together in a Gentlemen's Agreement? Commodore getting Europe where Commodore's business computer reputation has been traditionally strongest. Apple getting a clear shot at IBM in the U.S., unhampered by a competent, competitive domestic marketing effort from Commodore for the one machine that has the juice to out-Mac the Macintosh - or for that matter, out-PC the PC? That, of course, is the Commodore

Of course the ironies may only be that ironic. Or, perhaps, in \_his head Rattigan is still somehow back at Pepsico competing with Sculley, He got a computer company, I can do that too!

## BUYERS BEWARE!

## Commodore Users Group of Rochester

I subsoribe to several computer magazines, not all of which · are Commodore specific. Each of them is chock full of ads and every month I drool over the terrific bargains I would find.

Computer Direct does not charge extra for Master Card or Visa. It is based in Illinois so there is no sales tax. Only 53.08 is charged for shipping and handling. It sounded too good to be true. I ordered the four programs and they arrived in under 7 days, just as promised by

Computer Direct.

Bright and early the next morning, armed with the original ad, I was on the phone to ream them out about my being overcharged. I called the number in the ad and was greeted by a ma n from Protecto, explained my problem and directed him to the ad Family Computing. He asked me what and I told him a C128. He then told me that Computer Direct was for Apple products ONLY!

The ad did include computers and peripherials

Aminterestingly, the three versions do NOT really contradict each other. Gould probably was livid that Rattigan had his picture on the cover of Commodore Magazine - especially if the guy was trying to steal control of Commodore out from under himt Similarly, the new wave of firings wouldn't save all that much money, but they may have cleared the last of Rattigan's cohorts out of West Chester, paving the way for Gould's reorganization. And if Rattigan is dirty, it only goes to explain why Commodore's "savior" would pare sales and support to detrimentally low levels in the U.S. while simultaneously orchestrating a sucessful campaign abroad.

Most likely, the full details of Rattigan's personal agenda will be revealed once his lawsuit against Commodore comes to trial. But if he drops the case, or settles out of court for peanuts (no pun intended, that may be a confirmation of the worst suspicions.

The best way to find out about a good firm is word of mouth. As far as l'm concerned, ABEL SUPPLY (Sevierville, TN) is by far the best. They have a no frills policy and the savings are passed on to you. They hare a problem with hardware, send it baou a problem with hardware, send it back. If you have a question, call them.

Usually, buying by mail order with a credit card is an easy, safe, dependable and economical way to shop for computer goodies. And then something like this happens...

I called the company - MEI/MICRO CENTER in Columbus, Ohio and order 108 disks, 288 labels and a disk holder just to see what it looks like), The order lady (let's call her Before the Sheila) tells me that it will be about a week before the disks are shipped as they are running about a week behind due to the volume of orders they have received. problem," I say. That was March 30th.

I get a call from a fellow Amigan (well call him Paul who says he's found a place where double sided 3.5" diskettes can be purchased for less than a dollar each. For you 64/128 jockeys (many of whom are awaiting the Commodore 1581 disk drive), 3.5" diskettes usually cost $1.60 to $5.08 a piece! Naturally, I was thrilled,

About 18 days later, 1 get another call from Paul, wondering if I had received the disks yet. "Nope, not yet,

"Well," I say, "I think I'll give Sheila a call."

"Hmmm," he "I just placed another order (COD) and it only took two days."

5o l call. It's not Sheila, but whoever it is says my disks were shipped on April 6th via UPS. She says she will put a tracer on the order and that it will be from two to four weeks before we hear anything. UPS, the tightest ship in the shipping business evidently takes much longer to find a package than they do to lose it.

I wait a week or so and call again. "There's been no word, so why not just call back in a week if you haven't heard from us before then," she says.

So I wait. My VISA bill comes enough, there is a charge on it from MEI for $12l and change, I call again.

Another week or so. And I call again just a5 she suggested, I get the same song and dance. No word. Call back, blah, blah...

This time it's Sheila, MEI is having trouble with their computer (probably an IBM). "The order information won't come up on the screen." So she can't tell what my order was, or when the tracer to UPS was originally placed. "Let me go check the backup files. Can you hold?"

"Sure," I say.

Hold. Hold. Hold. Cuss. Hold.

"Hello?" She says she can't find the form from the UPS tracer in the backup files. It (IF?) a tracer had been placed on my order, there should be a paper form for it in their

She says the computers will hopefully be working right in a day or two. she finds that there hasn't (!) been a tracer put on my order, she'll put an emergency tracer on it that should take about two days (TWO DAYS?) to get a reply from UPS: In any case, she promises to have some kind of en ansuer by next Monday.

But Sheila is right on top of things. She calls me at work on friday, the 8th, wanting to know when my card was · charged. She's not waiting for the computer to get fixed. She's going right to the shipping files to get the info she needs to file the emergency tracer,

That's Monday, May Ilth, as it happens, my birthday. Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...

## Computer Culprits

Commodore Technical Users Group, Orange, CA

The University of Minnesota recently completed study showing that most companies are doing nothing to prevent tampering, embezzling and misuse. Company executives admit that they have encountered computer misuse and the lack of control has cost some companies hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Some disgruntled employees left 'logic bombs' that disable computer systems long after the employee had left the company, 38% of those who were caught said they had dome it for personal gain while 26% claimed they were ignorant of the rules. 24% said that it was 'misguided playfulness' while only 10% admitted they were attempting to harm the company.

Taking part in the survey were 1,211 companies and 28% indicated that their computers had been misused. Almost half of the incidents involved computer services such as Compuserve and Quantum Link.

The punishment given to those who were caught ranged from dismissal to one company who actually promoted the employee, buying his silence, In many cases, guilty employees were not punished because the companies' management felt that they were partly to blame for not giving the employees proper guidelines.

Almost half of the companies interviewed had no security system to protect their computers and those who did used only simple methods such as giving employees passwords. About one third of the computer misuse and abuse was uncovered by accident and most crime was not reported to the police for fear of getting publicity about the breach in computer security. The most surprising bit of data discovered was that 80% of the abusers were corporate employees!

## STARGLIDER

## Review by Barbara Cramer

Starglider by James Follett is one of the most realistic Star Wars type arcade games that 1 have seen for the Amiga. Very little time is needed to learn how to manipulate the aircraft leaving most of your energy to shoot the enemies. A nice variety of objects will appear in front of you as you zip about the screen - everything from two legged land walkers, armored vehicles and maintenance silos to floating mines, bird-like ships and, of course, a nice array of enemy aircraft.

there's no time for thinking. Your ship is armed with laser weapons and missiles and you may use keyboard, mouse or joystick. You are allowed to vary the cross-hair cursor from fixed or floating and you may even define keyboard controls to suit your preferences. The speech and sound features are quite good, speech is not too frequent and the music is digitized.

very nice description of your craft is vital part of the program is the Starglider Novella, it is important both for its storyline and description of enemy vessels but also for entrance into the program via word requestors, page 62, line 4, word 703.

If you like the Star Wars arcade game, I would highly recommend this game. The action is fast, the graphics are good and the complexity will keep you busy for a long time.

starglider is published worldwide Rainbird Software in London and published in the U.S. by

Game play is fast - almost too fast for amateurs. You will have to learn to be quick and maneuver the starglider by instinct;

## PAGESETTER Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem

White lines through printout or printer ejects page several times during printout.

Can't abort the printout,

Shadow on a shadowed box at the bottom or right edge of a page will not print.

Boxes near the right hand border of the page get cut off.

Document processed by PagelFF can't be used by DPaint.

Some horizontal borders do not print,

In the graphics editor, if the first thing you hit is a text gadget, the program crashes.

In the graphics editor, doing a pattern fill in an area already pattern filled causes the program to hang up.

No italics or underline with some fonts, especially Zuma Fonts.

## Recommended Solution

To conserve memory, Pagesetter uses a very small printer buffer and prints in strips. This requires a printer reset between strips and some printers produce a micro-linefeed, linefeed or formfeed when reset. Use the PagePrint utility to print out your document. This allocates a much larger printer buffer and is able to print out the complete document in one pass, without resetting the printer.

Pagesetter calculates the furthest right and lowest box on the page, Unfortunately, it doesn't account for the presence of shadow. Put an empty box somewhere below and to the right of the problem box.

Many printers and/or printer drivers will not print beyond the 8 inch mark on the page. Don't put anything you want printed beyond the 8 inch mark.

The document is too large or the wrong size, DPaint will only accept files which are 648 x 200 or 640 x 400 bug which doesn't allow it to save pictures larger than 32K. To get an updated PagePrint and Pagellt, send 5? U.S. ($18 Can.) to Gold Disk. These programs are also available at no cost on Compuserve, BIX and PLINK.

This is caused by Pagesetter's overlap calculations when deciding what gets printed. Move the box up or down by one pixel or use PagePrint.

This is caused by a bug in the VI.l if Intuition. This problem is solved if you use Vl.z of Kickstart or else: simply do anything else in the graphics editor before hitting the Text gadget.

This is not actually a bug. It just takes a loong time to pattern fill the very complex area left by the previous pattern fill. Patience!

Some fonts do not allow certain enhancements to be performed on them.

## TIP FOR 128 OWNERS

## From Scollsboro Commodore Users Group

I have heard of some 128 users having problems running commercial programs in the 54 mode. I had the problem once, but my discovery corrected it, and have never had trouble since.

With the amount of copy protection used on software these days, the 1571

definitely is bothered by it. But, ONLY If it's powered up in the 128 mode. If you plan on running C-64 software (with copy protection), make sure you power up in the 64 mode. This will insure that your 1571 will also be in the 1541 mode.

occurs when the 1571 disk drive is trying to read a single-sided disk, and at the same time has to deal with all that copy protection (in humans it is called HEAR I B UR N), So, to alleviate, what some people are calling a bug in the I28, make sure your 1571 is powered up in the 1541 mode.

The main trouble with the C-64 software on the 128

## FCC Ruling

## by Gerry Barker

We heard rumors this was coming months ago, and last week it happened. On June 18, the Federal Communications Commission proposed to eliminate an exemption from certain telephone access charges for interstate computer data base services,

The estimated added cost of using those data bases could be as much as 9 cents a minute, or about $5 an hour, which would double the cost to subscribers in some cases.

ve aiready taken several phone calls ane messages from concerned StarTexans, worrie‹ about the impact of this on Startext. To them and everyone else, be assured this ruling has No impact on Startext. It only affects INTERstate services -- such as CompuServe and Dow Jones, which utilize networks like Telenet.

The proposed change becomes effective Jan. 1988. Until then, comment is invited to the FCC (and I'll wager they get plenty!), A new update , this story is now available under "COMP13", It's must reading,

As you might expect, the ruling has angered both consumers and industry officials: who say the FC has dealt a crippling blow to an industry just getting started. The FCC contends data base services should pay their way like everyone else, instead of being subsidized by residential and business users.

As a longtime advocate of the dartboard technique for stock selection, I discovered that volume. I had a lot to learn about technical analysis methods. of confirming or denying your best guesses of a stock's future performance based on a study of its price and sales history,

hardcopy commands can be incorporated into customized macros, TAS-128 can calculate, plot, and print several different charts without constant operator intervention. This is a handy feature, since it allows the computer to generate a set of data while you go about your business.

I encountered a few minor problems printing to a Star Gemini 10% using a Cardco G-Whiz interface. After printing an excellent rendition of the four graphs currently on the screen, I called for a printout of the data used in calculating the graphs. The printer driver apparently failed to initialize printer and the result was text printed with the same compressed vertical spacing 35 was required by the previous printout, a graphic screen dump.

The instructions indicate that the program supports Epson compatibles as well as the Mannesmann Tally Spirit 88 and Olivetti PR 2308 printers, Early Commodore orinters which cannot handle 640- and 200line graphics will not work with this program,

I did encounter one serious problem, which fortunately occurred only once. For some reason, possibly when I was playing with the Communications module, I lost all the sample records which were supplied on the tutorial data disk. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to duplicate the error, and I mention the incident only to point out the importance of backing up all data disks.

## Meeting

The July quarterly meeting will feature a spreadsheet workshop, After a brief explanation of what a spreadsheet program is supposed to do, we will have demonstrations and comparisons of several different spreadsheet packages.

The meeting will be Saturday, July 18, 1:38 p.m. at the Hurst Recreation Center.

## Fort Worth Chapter

The Fort Worth Chapter had an enjoyable meeting in June, Our thanks to Pam Wiley, who demonstrated graphics design with Koala Pad. Pam is the artist whose design, "Fish" , was published in the May issue Ahoy magazine. The colors were much better on the computer screen than in the magazine! Pam showed us several other pictures and abstract works she had made, and she explained the techniques involved.

The meeting will be Saturday, July 1l, 1:38 p.m. at GDRA.-Mary Louise Hagemeyer

At our July meeting, Rick South will demonstrate the use of Cyber Video, Flexidraw, and Movie Maker to produce computer-generated animated videos. This is a new and exciting field, and the program should be very interesting.

## HEB News

While there was no formal presentation at the June 20th meeting, all those present enjoyed an interesting afternoon of computer conversation and sharing.

## HELP, HINTS and TRICKS

Undocumented 64 Commands Compiled by Lenny Waldman

Miami Individuals with Commodore Equipment EXTENSION TO FILE NAMES FOR EASIER LOADING LATER

To make it easier to load extensions to file names such as In general, quotes and commas can't be used in file names so we must trick the disk drive into accepting these (usually invalid) characters in file names.

## TRICK I

shifted-space is interpreted by the disk drive as the end of the filename and that is where il will pul Whe ulusing yuules uf Wit filename.

## TRICK Z

The character made by pressing the Commodore and "D" keys will print as a comma when the directory is listed. (It prints as a small square when typed in.)

## TRICK 3

The disk drive interprets the first colon in any file name as a delimeter separating the drive number from the name itself (as in, diname"), Therefore, to get the disk drive to accept a colon as part of the name, precede the name with "0".

## SOLUTIONS

1. To add "8" after the filename, do this: SAVE "I:NAME [Shifted-Space] ICBM-DJ8:".8 (RETURN)
2. To add "8,1" after the file name use: SAVE "8:NAME [Shifted-Space] [CBM-D] 8 ICBM-D]I:",8 (RETURN)

Note: CBM indicates the Commodore key L] indicates that 2 keys are pressed at the same time.

## SHORT TIME SAVER

Instead of your normal, LOAD "*" ,8,l l use, LOAD "*"8.9, Since the 9 is right next to the 8 on my keyboard, I save 2.13848 nanoseconds by not having to reach all the way over to hit the 1 key, Actually, any odd number will work,

## SPLAT FILES

A "splat file" is a file that was not properly closed. When the directory is listed, these files appear with "*" preceding their file type and normally can't be read. However, if you use this "M" parameter, you can now open and read any uncorrupted

## OPEN 15,8,15, "0:FILENAME,S,M"

A splat file corrupts the diskette and it will destroy other seemingly related disk files. Therefore, after you have read the data, you should validate the diskette. Do NOT scratch the splat file! The only safe way to remove a splat file is to validate the diskette, (And never validate a disk with random or relative files on it.)

## TO CLOSE ALL OPEN FILES

OPEN 15,8,15: CLOSE 15

## TO APPEND

"A" adds data to a sequential data file, OPEN 8,8,8,"0:FILENAME,S,A"

## WILD CARD

OPEN 8,8,8, 0:FILENAME,MA" (This command opens any type of file for

"M" opens any type of file, appending.)

## EASY MACHINE LANGUAGE LOAD

OPEN 15,8,15: PRINT#15, "RO: NEWNAME [shiftspacel [CBM-U] [CBM-DI [CBM-E]=OLD NAME" CLOSE15

To make machine language programs easier to load, you may rename them in a special way,

When the directory is listed, you will see: "NEW NAME",8,1 PRG

All you have to do is cursor to the line, type LOAD and press RETURN.

## LOAD FIRST FILE

The command LOAD"*" 8 will load the first program on your diskette when you first turn on your system. After other programs been loaded, it will load the last program loaded. If you change the command to LOAD"'"*",8, it will load the first program on the disk regardless.

## CONVERT PRG TO SEQ FILES

You may convert a BASIC program to a sequential data file by loading the BASIC program into memory. Then type: OPEN 8,8.."0:NAME.3.W,":CMD8:LIST:PRINT#8:CLOSE8

## LOAD DOS PROTECTED SOFTWARE

The following immediate mode command will stop the read/write head from bumping repeatedly when loading protected software.

CHR$(0)CHR$(1)CHR$(133):CLOSE15

OPEN15,8,15:PRINT#15,'M-W"; CHR$(106)
