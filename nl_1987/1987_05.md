Every now and then and order something sight unseen by mail I was in the market for a new printer and noticed a Computer Centers America ad for an SB-10, described as a 24-pin dot matrix printer with friction and tractor parallel intertace, character set, and printing speeds of ter cps in draft mode and 54 cps in letter uality mode.

## How To Get More In Your Disk Directory

Author Unknown - Commodore Technical Users Oroup. Orange, CA

Commodore DOS limits the number of directory entries to 144. The reason being that it uses 18 sectors in track 18 store are to the directory. There possible entries course, 8 X 18 = 144. sector and, of The nineteenth sector, sector 0, is used for the BAM. The directory uses 3rd sector in the following 4, + order: 1, every 2, 51F any less 17, 3 6, 9; 12; 15, 16 12, 15, 16.

This is how to get more than 144 entries in the directory.

any than last 18 then the sectors are used sector NEXT TRACK AND SECTOR POINTER is OFF.

1. Format the disk.
2. Using DISECTOR a tool choice, allocate al"i track 19. This wil] prevent anything from being stored in that track.
3. Save files to the disk. I saved about 140 Print Shop graphics files.
4. "ine track is sectchoice the sectors orrespondins track 19 sector. For xample, 18/1 tc 19/1, 18/4 to 19/4 anc so on.
5. DISECTOR, file type byte to 00 directory in track on the disk are in a ton track 19.
6. Using DISECTOR, fix all the track and sector pointers in track 19. They, wil! refer to track 18 if you do not change them.
7. Again using DISECTOR, write in ALL the proper track and sector the directory through all ine sectors ce the sectors of track 18. At 18/18, set the pointer to 19/1.
8. Now you can save more files to the disk. The number of files that you can save may be limited by the remaining free blocks. more 3 block I could only save about 80 files.
9. Depending on which file copier you use be with "bISECTOR and necessary to fix the go back 1n track and sector Dolnter on the last directory sector that the copier used.

Now, what is much really but this useful for? Not can Print Shop or Printmaster store all your files on fewer disks. There are some drawbacks. You will lot be able to delete any of the files ir the track 19 directory. DOS wil] allow it.

Another use might be in a BBS. If there are files on the Message Base disk that will never change and sysop wants to maximize the number of possible messages to permanent files to 144 track move the S.™ 19 and fix the pointers.

it was fun to tigure out how to do it. Anyway i have a disk 211 Print and there are more 5leg che free had our back te the more files on if I BAM and de-allocated thåse sectors thak weren't used. Maybe I could squeeze out more sectors.
