## MCCC Sponsors Metroplex Computer Conference

## Scott Lamb

Mark Saturday, October 24th, on your calendar as the date of the Metroplex Computer Conference to be held at the Arlington Convention Center. This all day event is sponsored by the Mid-Cities Commodore Club, and · W111 involve the joint production efforts of all the MCCC chapters.

The featured speaker of the conference will be Eric Graham, Ph.D.. the creator of the now famous animated, COlOP Amiga computer demo, "Juggler". Dr. Graham will be speaking on the subject of "Ray Tracing in Computer Graphics", and will demonstrating his recently released solid modeling software package, "Sculpt 3D", and the soon to be released graphic animation package, "Animate 3, both published by Byte by Byte. Other graphic renditions, like "Juggler", are to be shown. In addition Dr. Graham will demonstrate the new Mimetics frame buffer which allows 16 million colors (640 x 480 resolution with effectively 24 bit planes) to . simultaneously displayed with an Amiga computer.

Also planned for the conference will be a demonstration of the new Aniga 500 and 2000 computer systems and a sampling of Amiga software by Richard Bilyea of the Software

Terminal This demonstration should be of particular interest to User Group Members who recently received the software discount coupon from Commodore Aniga. With the purchase of an Amiga 500, the coupon entitles the User Group Member to one of two software packages (Pack A, a $600 value for $99, consisting of Deluxe Paint II, Aegis Animator, Textcraft Plus, Pagesetter, Marble Madness, and an Ipyx joystick: Plan B, a 51200 value for 5199, consisting of Pagesetter Deluxe, Maxiplan 500, Superbase Personal, Word Perfect, Deluxe Video, Diga, and CLI Mate),

Other demos relating to the the Commodore 64 and 128 computers, as well as the Amiga family of computers are currently being planned. A complete agenda for the October 24th Metroplex Computer Conference will be printed in the next MCCC newsletter. It you would like to become involved in the production of this exciting event, contact your chapter vice-president.

Mark your calendar today. October 24 Arlington Convention Center

## SUPER C - A REVIEW James Alexander

CCCC, Tucson, AZ

I guess the first place to start is the language itself. The 'C' language, first developed, by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, has existed since about 1972. It is a structured language, and therefore ALL programs can be written without the use of jumps. (No GOTO's!) Rather than sections of the code being subroutines, they are defined as functions and can pass arguments and a result. The result of this is that the programs are easier to read and maintain and the functions are easy to incorporate into other programs. ·C is a compiled language and is, therefore, VERY fast. C programs are written in such a way that they can be transported to another machine with very little change. The specifics of each machine are handled by the compiler.

sections which should be familiar to anyone who has worked on conpiled programming languages before, They are the editor, compiler, and the linker. The editor is where you write the programs in C language. The com-

Super-C comes with 3 main

Super-C can use up to 8 disk drives, and it has the ability to use the extra memory of the 128 as a RAM disk if so desired Super-C also has a command pre-processor, which is where most commands standard are entered. operating system of the computer 15 no longer used. Al50, a different font is the default in SuperC. Many functions that are liable to be needed in your programs are included in library files, which are 'object files' of functions that have already been compiled, (Of course, they couldn't be object files w/o being compiled!) The mathematics of · a C64 (or 128) is limited, scope and importantly, its accuracy. Included in Super-C are DOUBLE PRECISION math functions: sin, cos, tan, atan, abs, sgn, sqr, sgrt, rnd, log, exp. These are

piler is where your programs are translated . into an object file. The linker is where your object file and other object files that your program will use are 'linked' together into executable machine language. reason for the tremendous speed-up of 'C' programs over BASIC is that C programs are in machine language, whereas BASIC programs have to be translated and then branch to their machine code equivalents WHILE they run. In fact, many C programs even be faster than many of the 'Load 'fn'.8,1' files that you use now. The object files. The functions include: graphic, graphon, graphoff, backgr, colors, cirmap, setcol, fill, dot, dotin, bdot, line, bline, shape, isgraph, setplot, plot, mapy, *mline, *oline, *plotobj. *pushobj, *bplotobj, *fplotobj mask, &amp; *bmap. Also, colors can be stated by the name of the color, as opposed to the color code. I don't expect you to know what all these functions are, but they are ALL useful and a lot easier to understand than a half a page of peeks and pokes.

reason is that many of those files are BASIC programs with parts of the program relying on machine language subroutines. The subroutines are very fast, but the BASIC parts (usually the majority of the program) aren't. However, compiled C programs are all machine language and therefore very fast in their entirety.

pretty much the standard necessary math functions, but the added , advantage is the extra precision. The C64 (or 128) also has good graphics, and are especially difficult to use in a program. Well, Super-C also has a graphic library of

The ENTIRE C language is included in Super-C, with the exception

of bit-fields. Just about anything that you would do on the C64 (or 128) can be done with Super-C. The obvious advantage is the ease of incorporating functions from one program into another program so that you don't keep reinventing the wheel.

One thing that will make Super-C much better to use is the addition of an extra drive. It'll run fine with one, but you don't have to do any diskswapping with two drives. programs that are written in C give you the opportunity of producing two different run time versions. One of them will run only from the command processor, and the other will run from BASIC. Therefore, nothing extra is needed to run ANY of the programs on any computer,

Also, consider the fact that most C programs will RUN more than SIX times as fast as the same program (if you could write it would in BASIC.

Super-C allows you (easily) to take care of things like formatted input and output, disk file handling, structures (records), and much more. There are many, many functions in C that don't have a BASIC equivalent and would require a subroutine to do the same task (for instance, the graphics functions).

I've quoted this example before, but just in case you didn't catch it the first time, I wrote a little routine that would fill the screen DOT BY DOT. The program was written in C and in · Also, as an added test, I put the DOT BY DOT C version against a LINE BY LINE BASIC version, and these are the results:

for them. Even in short programs, you will notice the tremendous speed difference, but it is in the longer programs that the true elegance shows.

DOT BY DOT in BASIC took 4min

LINE BY LINE in BASIC took 56sec. DOT BY DOT in 'C' took 43sec. Super-C is copyrighted by Data Becker and Abacus Software.

## 128 Safety Tip

Bob Young

Looking at the back cover of your C-128, look into the user port on the ught. Between the circuit board and the bottom of the case, they have a thin shield. have seen several units that have this shield bowed up toward the circuit board. It it is all owed to contact the bottom of the board, could cause a disaster! Stick a ittle piece of rubber or other soft insulation gently between the board and the shield to assure it never touches. Use a 5mai piece 5o that you don't block the air flow!!

So far, I really am pleased with this compiler. It has no major flaws, I can't even think of a minor one. To anyone who wants to get the MOST out of his C64 (or any other computer), 'C' is the best choice. For the C64 (or 128), Super-C is as close as you'll get to maximizing the efficiency of your programming 'C' takes time to learn to use, and a long time to learn to use well, but the results are well worth the time. So, I can only say that I HIGHLY recommend this to all programmer types, and HIGHLY suggest to all others that this probably isn't

When you work on a C progran, you will need a master disk (THE master disk, if you don't have a nibbler), and a work disk. Also, keep the manual close by; you'll need it. The more you progran, the less you need it, of course.

## PRINTER INTERFACES

## FRED FIELD

does a printer interface do? Did you know that interface has electronics in it such as a microprocessor and small system program? Yep, it's actually

![Image](1987_09_artifacts/image_000002_badba4771cdbff954c114deb8ff10bcc2f69bd9da3e1c5e50a7a629fa3b4b9a7.png)

that comes from the computer, possibly through a disk drive or two, is smal and carries information one bit after another. The cable going from the interface to the printer is bigger, possibly a flat ribbon cable, and carries information with the bits traveling side by side as a group. What the interface does is like the starting gate official at a horse race. The horses led to the gate in single file. The manager locks them into the proper stals. A gun sounds and the horses are released together. Data comes into the interface one bit at a time, the interface shifts each bit into place then fires them off to your parael printer 8 bits at a tine.

Just exactly what graphics output. When you have your printer interface · your in transparent mode, it sends the numbers straight through without change (except from serial to parallel form). It is as though the interface were not there: transparent to the system Thus it is up to the sender or program to make sure the numbers being sent are the codes and characters defined in the printer. These are found in the manual that came with the printer. In a nonCommodore printer the character codes are usualy standard ASCIl. Note that not all printer interfaces have a transparent mode of operation.

Earty on in Commodore computer history, the 1525 printer was the top mark. It was the dot matrix which could print all of the characters that the Commodore computers could (including the graphics characters on the face of the keys) and cold also do bit mapped graphics. As there was no standard among the non-Commodore printers people were hooking up, the interface makers adopted the 1525 as the A printer is a fairly Commodore standard. After simple unit.

about Commodore. When you have your printer interface in emulate mode, though, the printer knows about both Commodore and your printer, provided the dip switches in the interface have also selected the family your printer belongs to. The interface ixxu converts fron the Commodore 1525 printer codes and Commodore ASCI character codes to the codes needed for your printer. Now your printer gives the same output (usualy better quality) as the 1525 woul give. Thus, you essentialy have a 1525 printer built-in to your system. You can use the 1525 printer manual and any programs written for the 1525 will work for you

In addition to the conversions mentioned above, the interface also performs standard handshaking of all data. This must be done both with the computer and with the printer. A signal is sent to the computer indicate readiness to receive

## ADVENTURE PROGRAMMING

## Werner Meserth

, few years ago learning about computers · meant learning programming, not learning how to use software. But more and more programming is being left to experts. understanding a computer language makes it difficult to know how a word processor, a robot or any form of artificial intelligence can do its tasks. Learning a high level computer language like BASIC has not become more difficult and it certainly is still worth learning.

User guides coming with computers, 'how to' booklets from stores or instructors school can teach the commands. Good versions of BASIC have more than fifty commands, but beginners can get away with knowing fewer than ten commands and still do something creative with them. However, many people, having learned the commands, don't know where to go from there. An Adventure story is a fun first creative effort using BASIC. Essential BASIC concepts and commands

Clearing Screen Print Statements (PRINT...) Variable for character (X$) Variable for number (X) Input Statement (INPUT...) Unconditional Statement (GOTO...) Conditional Statement (IF...THEN)

Loops (FOR...TO...NEXT)

Once these concepts are learned the fun can begin. You are ready to create an ADVENTURE STORY.

omputer adventures are 'mind fantasies': A The player may find himself at a specific location starting to explore. Goals might be to find a certain number of treasures, get out of a dungeon, or complete a voyage.

The following story plot and program lines are given just to whet your creative appetite: Example Story:

Some programmers also find it advantageous to make an accurate flowchart or map of the adventure, Without it, programming may quickly become confusing.

Recently the incomparable Rossetta Jewel was stolen. Rumor has it that a sneaky · snake is hiding it in its cave. You, a very brave and slightly mentally unbalanced hero, decide to recover it. Friends offer you several items to help you defeat the snake. For the quest you can only carry one of the items. Convinced that not all items are useful, some may even be harmful, you choose carefully.

## TV/BUG, Boise, Idaho

‹The previous paragraph would be PRINT Statements). The choices would follow (1) ax. (2) snake charm, (3) reptile lotion, (4) computer programmer's guide.

Thems ver i inked number from one the items by picking a number from one to four. The next several program lines would look something like this:

```basic
90 PRINT 'Which do you choose' 
100 INPUT X

110 IF X=1 THEN PRINT'You chose the ax' :C=1

120 IF X=2 THEN PRINT'You chose the Snake Charm':C=2

140 IF X=4 THEN PRINT'You chose the Programmer's Guide':C=4

130 IF X=3 THEN PRINT'You chose the Reptile Lotion':C=3
```

Line 100 accepts your number (1 to 4). One of the next four lines (110-140) prints what you chose and enters into the computer's memory the corresponding number variable (i.e. C=1, C=2, C=3 or C=4).

A t the end of the story when our hero meets the snake IF...THEN statements will tell the player what happened:

```basic
600 IF C=1 THEN PRINT'The ax works but has no effect on the snake! 
610 IF C=1 THEN PRINT'The snake poisons you!': END 
620 IF C=2 THEN PRINT'The snake charm

630 IF C=2 THEN PRINT'You take home the snake but leave the jewels. : END
```

works, but only on you!

The reptile lotion turns the snake into a fire-breathing dragon, which in turn fries our hero. The correct choice in this adventure is number 4, the programmer's booklet. With it our hero could have quickly 'programmed' the sneaky snake into a cute rabbit. He could have then taken home both the jewel and the pet rabbit.

efore this final showdown our hero faces several obstacles along the way. A key may have to be found to enter the snake's cave. A flashlight may prevent our hero from falling into a bottomless pit. The bottomless pit scene may look like this:

```basic
300 PRINT 'Do You turn on the Flashlight? (type Y or N)'

310 INPUT X5 
320 IF X$ = 'y' THEN PRINT 'Smart choice": GOTO 400 
330 IF X5 = 'N' THEN PRINT 'You stumble a little further..' 
340 IF X$ = ' THEN PRINT 'and fall into a bottomless hole' 
350 IF X$ = 'N' THEN FOR R = 1 to 25: PRINT 'Haalihhh !!!': NEXT R 
360 IF X$ = 'N' THEN PRINT 'After 3 days of falling you die of starvation': 
370 GOTO 310
```basic
200 PRINT 'There is a hole in the ground.

Do you jump in? (Yes or No)

## 210 INPUT X$

220 IF X$ = 'YES' OR X$ = 'Y' THEN PRINT 'DUMB MOVE': GOTO 500 
230 IF X$ = 'NO' OR X$ = 'N' THEN PRINT 'SMART KID!' : GOTO 600 
240 GOTO 210
```enes that can be included in longer adventures.

```basic
200 PRINT 'There is a hole in the ground.

Do you jump in (Y or N)? 
210 GET X$ : IF X$ = " THEN 210 
220 IF X$ = "Y' THEN PRINT 'DUMB MOVE' : GOTO 500 
230 IF X$ = 'N' THEN PRINT 'SMART KID!' : GOTO 600 
240 GOTO 210
```

## 210 INPUT X$

220 IF X$ = 'YES' OR X$ = 'Y' THEN PRINT 'DUMB MOVE': GOTO 500 230 IF X$ = 'NO' OR X$ = 'N' THEN PRINT 'SMART KID!' : GOTO 600 240 GOTO 210

The computer will print to screen the info about the hole and if the player wants to jump in. Line 220 will print a question mark and then the computer waits for the player's response. After a response has been typed, it is still program continues. The IF...THEN statements in lines 220 and 230 will direct the program to lines 500 or 600 depending on the player's response (Yes or No). Lines 500 and 600 are not part of the excerpt. Line 240 assures that the player will only type in acceptable responses. Other responses such as 'Maybe' will return the program to line 210.

The next example does the same, but note the difference in line 210.

200 PRINT 'There is a hole in the ground.

Do you jump in (Y or N)? 210 GET X$ : IF X$ = " THEN 210 220 IF X$ = "Y' THEN PRINT 'DUMB MOVE' : GOTO 500 230 IF X$ = 'N' THEN PRINT 'SMART KID!' : GOTO 600 240 GOTO 210

The GET command does not automatically print a question mark to the screen. It also does not wait for the RETURN key to be hit. The program just continues. For that reason. line 210 tells the program to hold at that line IF no letter or key is entered. (Note: The double quotes (") mean no key or letter). Once a letter from the keyboard is typed, the program will continue. If 'y' or 'N' is typed, the program will print to the screen the appropriate statement and then go to line 500 or 600. There will be no time to spell out entire words like 'Yes' or 'No'. Unacceptable responses (letters other than Y or N) will return the program to line 210.

Lines such as 240 are safety devices. Without them, an accidental inappropriate response sends the program to the next line that is not an IF...THEN statement. This line will of course make no sense to the player and ruin the adventure.

notoriously slower than they need to be Usualy the computer is doing other things simutaneously like supporting the screen and checking for the STOP key. These may take time away from the printing, Hardware is usually light years ahead and more capable than most of the software written for it. Programmers arise!

We've all seen the page layout advertising Writer's Workshop. The headers, footers, double columns and graphics pasted everywnere in the document: #ell it ain't so folks.

The Workshop consists of Geowrite 2.D, GeoMerge, Geolaser and Text Grabber, plus misc printer and input drivers.

GeoWrite 2.0 allows insertion of graphics anywhere on the text page, CENTERED RIGHT TO LEFT between the margins. (As ALL GeoWrite applications allow!) You can have margins set most anywhere on the page, 10 to 70, 5 to 40, 40 to 70 and etc. But there can

only be ONE set of margins per page. The text column can use all the page, the center, the right side or the left, BUT NOT more than one column per page. Headers and footers are supported, as is justification of text.

I have not used GeoMerge: it was not a factor in my purchase of this program. The ability to import other word processing text and to paste graphics anywhere on the page were! As stated above, anywhere graphic placement is a PIPE DREAM, and so to the grabber. The Text Grabber is fully menu-driven. You run this application: it asks which #P you want. There are only a few, Easy Script, Paper Clip, SpeedScript and Generic. (There are one or two others.) Select the WP. I have not tried Generic but as Easy\_ Script is my WP of choice on the 64, I chose that. Tell the program the file name and soon you are looking at the file

GeoLaser is a program aimed at Apple's Laser printer, and the disk contains an Apple Laser Printer driver. The Laser printer program allows multiple page printouts (in photography it's called a double or triple exposure), and when discovered, sends the photographer right up the wall.. AH-HA 50 THAT'S how they did it? Printed that double column page in · the advertisement. Page one consisted of header, footer and a graphic or two centered on standaard margin format. Page two, nargin probably about 10 to 35 with graphics centered between those margins and page three, margins approx. 43 to 75 with centered graphics. Then the laser printer was told to act like all three pages were one and print it all out in one pass!!! So Geowrite 2.0 CANNOT do that page

Margins and other paging controls are supposed to be translated correctly. My first try resulted in a 40 column format??, and I wasn't allowed to change it!!!??? On another ES WP file try, I got approx 50 column format and printed it out and saved the file under GEOS and did some other stuff including shutting the system off. When I came back up and on-line with Geowrite, I tried to load the file and it crashed the system repeatedly.

layout, but it can be done Laser printer. Sorry, Not "A" · but Apples's Laser printer. I called 'em and asked how much (a local dealer), They told me fifty Seven Ninety Nine. How, what a deal, like CBM's 1520 plotter for only 49.99, when it was $200 or $300. Only Fifty Seven Ninety Nine I repeated. Yes, the clerk said, Five THOUSAND, Seven Hundred, Ninety Nine Dollars.

So, how did I do it? Created three (3) pages, one with header and hetteen standard margie page tED page two everything to the left with graphics centered between those margins and page three to the right. Then get a HEAVY piece of paper and start sending it through the printer, again and again and again.. That is operator cunning and persistence overcoming programming deficiencies. Berkeley calls it progran capability. Let's hear it for Berkeley!!! Hmmm, Hmmm (censored).

I dropped the phone. Turned out that was the price for the PLUS(?) model: a standard version can be had for Four Thousand...yep, never mind.

Of course, if you can't afford a Laser Printer, you can modem your files back east somewhere (REM:Quantum Link) and get true LASER printing done for a dollar a

Getting a double column page with headers and footers was a real pain. That page took two days of work. The whole thing can't be one document. The headers and footers must be on their own document, then the pages of 40 column printing in another document.

## FONTMASTER 128| C-64 KEYBOARD REPLACEMENT

## Jean Goddin Arizonia CUG

For those of you who have a C128 and haven't yet chosen word processor that works in the 128 mode, XETEC (the same people who make the printer interface) have published FONTMASTER 128. It will let you hold approximately 64k Bytes in text memory at a time and has room for g of its superfonts concurrently.

First of all there are more than 45 fonts (type styles) to select from. In addition to the normal print there are many fancy and unusual ones (including script, italic DIde English, and mirror which prints a mirror illage).

This word processor fits into the class of programs that are relatively easy to learn and use and yet versatile enough to offer a great deal of options.

When it comes to selecting your print options, you may choose Pica, Elite, or almost 20 other pitches, compress, boldface, or expanded print modes, subscript, superscript, and even underlining/highlighting of text blocks. You can do proportional spacing, centering, and justification. And the program supports about 100 different printers, so no matter which printer you have it should work with this program It also offers the option of columnar printing (up to 4 columns), headers and footers. You can even preview your final document in the font you have chosen on screen before you send it to the printer.

As word processors go, this one is fun one use. Normally, FONTMASTER 128 retails for $59.95.

This program even offers 4 help screens for folks who want that extra support. It also allows form letter/data merging and has formatters for inserting graphics into documents. It offers the advantage of 80 column format, easy access to the file names on your disk directory, and PRG file merge,

After several months of fighting malfunctioning keys on my C-64, I was about ready to delegate the equipment trash can. Dirty contacts were suspect, the space bar did not function unless it was hit two inches from the left side, several keys had to be hit quite hard to get a response, etc. When Radio Shack announced the availability of a replacement keyboard (their catalog #277-1027) for $4.95, I decided to gamble with my ability to make a substitution. However, the radio Shack keyboard is NOT a replacement for the C-64. Although they are almost identical mechanically, the wiring is not the same. So, here's what I did.

At this point, contacts on both the key plungers and the circuit board may be cleaned. I opted, however, replace all those assemblies with those front the Radio Shack board. Make a sketch of the C-64 keyboard so that key caps can be positioned correctly during reassembly.

Remove the 3 screws from the bottom front side of the computer and separate the keyboard section from the electronic works. Unplug the 2 cables and position the keyboard with the circuit board up. Unsolder the wires from the SHIFT LOCK key switch. Using #0 Phillips screwdriver, remove the 23 small screws which fasten the printed circuit board to the enclosure.

Pry off caps from all the key assemblies, starting from the numbers row and working toward the space bar. Quite a bit of force is required for their removal time taken to fashion a tool for the purpose will be well spent. Picture a strawberry huller and make it something like that, but with 1/8 inch lips folded inward at the 'huller' end and 50 spaced that the tool will fit over the key. With the lips over the key, pull straight up. A small 'crow bar' under the key will be a

help.

Now start the cleaning and reassembly of new components. #ash your hands! As a precaution, briefly rub the plunger contacts firmly on a lint-free white paper placed on a flat surface. Inspect each contact for contamination. Clean the gold contacts on the printed circuit board. I used cotton swabs (Q-Tips) and alcohol-alcohol on one end of the sticki the dry end for polishing Inspect each contact under a strong light.

Each key assembly is comprised of three parts the cap, a spring and the plunger with its carbon contact element. Don't mix the assemblies from the two keyboards!

If the space bar is to be removed, pry the straight spring (below the bar) from the two clips which are an integral part of the black molding on which the keys are mounted.

Before fastening to the circuit board, inspect\_carefully under a strong light,\_looking for any contamination.

To reassemble, start with the space bar edge of the panel Insert a contact plunger from the back side and hold in place with a flat back-up (1 used a heavy b' rule). Turn the panel over and place a spring over the plunger. Next, push firmly on the cap-usually it will snap into place. Check to see that all caps are the same height. (B&amp;B Ed Note: It may be easier to insert all plungers and refasten the circuit board before installing the springs and keycaps.)

Fasten · the keyboard panel to the circuit board with the : 23 screws, solder the wires to the SHIFT LOCK key mechanism, plug in the 2 cables, and complete the assembly. My C-64 works like new again.

## AMIGA TV RF

## MODULATOR

## William Beshures

Sometimes it is difficult to justify everything you do, like buying an Amiga when you already have an Apple computer and an Dhio Scientific computer. Ever since I bought my Amiga in October of 1985, I have wondered what the display would look like on a color television.

If you are just a little bit curious about using a TV as the Amiga's display, this article is written tor you.

You may ask "Who cares about a color TV when you have an RGB color monitor?" Well, I guess it is hard to justify. The excuse I gave my spouse was that it would be easier to take the computer to the cottage if we could use · the television at the lake instead of the color monitor (one less thing to fit into the car,

You can make a TV RF Modulator for an Amiga for under ten dollars, but you will have to break out the soldering iron in the closet (another thing you bought and don't use very often). Your local Radio Shack stocks a TV RF Modulator (Cat. No. 277-1015) that can accept audio and video from a computer and convert signals for use with a television. The modulator has 'Texas Instruments' printed on it with a model number of UM1381-1. I believe it was the one used with the T.I. home computer.

The top of the modulator pops off very easily allowing you to examine the wire connections inside the box. It is not necessary that you open the modulator but you may want to double check that yours is wired the same

This modulator comes with a 5 pin DIN connector, while the socket on the back of the Amiga requires an 8 pin DIN connector. This is why you will need to use the soldering iron. You will not be able to find an 8 pin DIN connector at Radio Shack but you should be able to find one at a local electronics parts store.

way mine was. You will notice that each wire connection is clearly. labeled (black-system ground, clear-video in, yellow-audio in, etc.) Once you are satisfied that your box is the same as mine, put the lid back on: we are going to make our changes at the connector,

The two metal shields can be removed to show the solder side of the 5 pin DIN plug. Use your soldering

Your next chore is to remove the 5-pin connector on the modulator. The plastic hood on the connector will slide off the connector and up the wire. Use a small bladed screwdriver and some effort. Don't worry about breaking the connector. You're going to throw it away when were finished.

iron to remove each of the wires.

Note that two adjacent pins need to be connected to the same wire. These are the left and right channels of the audio output from the Amiga. The video ground wire is a bare wire with a short clear sheath to protect it.

Now look at the diagram which shows you how to connect the wires to the solder side of the 8 pin DIN connector. Two of the pins, the ones labeled 'n.c', will not be connected to any wIres.

Once you have finished soldering the wires to the appropriate pins, you can attach the two metal shields and slide the plastic hood back over the

Finally, connect the antenna leads connector.

that I purchased with the Amiga.

If you do not yet oun an Amiga but are thinking of buying one, you might consider using a TV until you can afford the RGB color monitor. If you already own an Aniga and monitor, just tell your 'better half that if you make a TV RF Modulator, there will be one less thing to load into the car for those weekend trips to the cottage on the lake.

The CB fad ("citizens band") hit it big back in the Seventies, when people al over America started to put CB radios in their cars. The craze didn't last very long, mostly because drivers who aren't truckers don't have a whole lot to say to one another besides, "10-4, good buddy."

You'll find CB simulation available on Compuserve, GEnie, Quantumink, Minitel and other computer networks. As many as 200 people gather at the same time to chat the night away.

But mass communication is no fad. Here in the Eighties, Cb has advanced new level. Every night, computer enthusiasts al over the work gather front of their screens to "chat" with friends whose faces they wil never see and whose voices they will never hear.

Weird things are happening on CB. On Compuserve, an Dregon man was chatting for a year with a man in Canada, when they discovered they were third cousins." they Ferrari" from Kansas City and "Bandit" from Memphis realized they had the same great grandfather.

The price to see other people's words on your computer screen-as little as $5 an hour. That sounds reasonable. But last month Robert Kordet, a Georgia man who subscribes to GEnie, paid $1200 to chat on CB. That works out to eight hours a day, seven days a week.

A few years back, articles about people meeting online and getting married were fairly common. Now its divorces. Cathleen Anderson of Quantumink says, "It gets a ittle messy at times. People meet other people online and fall in love, but they're aready married to someone else."

The August meeting featured a demonstration of the Midi interface and keyboard used by the various music programs. Bill Keatley did a fine job presenting the demo, and the club's appreciation and thanks is also extended to Kerry Bates for the use of his keyboard.

The September meeting's theme is "Hacker's Tools", presented by Dave Campbell. Many of our members attended Dave's class in programming language and know what a fine job he does. In this presentation, he will cover the various software tools available in the club library and elsewhere.

Due to the spectacular Quarterly\_Meeting planned in October, there will be no Thursday night Amiga chapter meeting. Be sure to attend this extravaganza and hear Eric Graham of Byte-by-Byte talk about 3-D graphics.

Many of the chapter's monthly meetings are being planned by ad hoc committees. Members are asked to donate their time to plan one month's meeting. In this way, the membership gains greater input into the program and your overworked officers are able to spend more time in long range planning. With the size of our chapter, if every member helped out when asked, an individual would not be asked more than once every 12 to 18 months, depending on the number required for each ad hoc committee. Please be generous and say "Yes" when asked to volunteer.
