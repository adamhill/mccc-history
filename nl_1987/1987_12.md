## MCCC Constitution Changes John Malmstrom

If you attended your November chapter meeting, you know that the Board of Directors has proposed a revision to our constitution. I want to take this opportunity to tell you a little of how the proposal came about and why I think it's important to the future of MCCC.

Every organization, large or small, requires a set of rules by which it should operate. For small groups a verbal agreement among the few members may be sufficient, but for organizations as large as MCCC: a more formal written set of rules in necessary. When I first became President nearly a year ago, one of the first things I did was read our Articles of Constitution to see just what our operating rules are. The more I read, the more confused I became because there are articles in our constitution that seem to contradict each other, others that are unclear in their meaning, and still others that simply cannot be followed if we are to be a viable organization. For example, there are references to a Board of Directors (apparently a club level body) and to an Executive Committee (apparently a chapter level body) where one term is used but the other is clearly meant. Another example is in the area of expenditure limits and approval requirements. Our current rules do not require the Treasurer to report expenditures to the Board of Directors as long as individual expenditures exceed $25.00. (He does, but it's not required). Expenditures between $25.00 and $100.00 require prior approval of the Board, and expenditures of .

expenditures $100.00 require prior approval of the entire membership. If we had tried to abide with those requirements, events like our recent Metroplex Computer Conference could never be held. The time frame needed to obtain membership approval (30-60 days) is simply too long. (By the way, your Board Directors approved expenditures of about $900.00 for the conference, but we recovered about $800.00 of that in increased memberships disk sales. If the state frowned on our planned door prize raffle, we would have been able to replenish our treasury a bit.)

Our original constitution was drafted in 1983 when MCCC was first organized. It served our needs very well while we were small and all met together in one place every month. By 1985 the club had grown to over 500 members and was having difficulty meeting the needs of all our members, so we decided to reorganize into smaller chapter units while retaining the centrai club structure. At that time there was a revision to the constitution, but it did not address all the issues of how we need to operate. I (and the rest of the Board) felt that it was time to take a good look at just what was needed to bring the constitution up to date and make it usable for the future of MCCC. So, several months ago I appointed a committee consisting of Harold Williams, Bill Raecke, Fred Noble, and myself. This committee spent many hours (I remember only too well a couple of sessions that went well past midnite) cussing and discussing, writing and rewriting, and finally came to a consensus which was presented to the

Board last month. The Board voted to present the proposed revisions to the membership at the November chapter meetings and the vote on adoption will be taken at the special holiday club meeting on December 12.

Most of the proposed changes are for the purpose of clarification, but there are some that considered substantive, Let me point out a few those to you. (1) Quarterly club meetings be replaced by special club events (such as our recent conference). (2) Proxy voting will be permitted on any issue (not just chapter elections): (3) Newsletter Editor and BBS Coordinator will be appointed offices on the Board of

Directors, (4) The Treasurer will be required to report all expenditures to Board of Directors who monitor all expenditures. Unusual expenditures outside of regular established club functions will still require approval of the membership. (5) Chapter presidents will automatically be members of the Board and additional Chapter representation will be based current chapter membership. (6) A provision has been added to permit dissolution of a chapter for nonactivity or failing to comply with ciub rules.

If you didn't get a chance to see the proposal at your chapter meeting, the current constitution and the proposed revision are available for downloading in the reference section of the club's ASCII BBS (or see your chapter president). Be sure to attend the annual MCCC Holiday meeting at Brookside Convention Center in Hurst on December 12. We're looking forward to good fellowship for all.and of course we will have this important vote on the proposed revision to our constitution.

## See you there!

## CLI Shortcuts for the AMIGA

## Shortened Commands

## Rigoberto Ramirez, Buckhannon, WV

Here is a shortcut that I found when using CLI on the Amiga. I went to the C directory and opened a number of commands, giving them shorter names, For example:

CDPY C-DIR TO C:D COPY CENDCLI TO C-END COPY C:DELETE TO C-DEL

Now if I'm getting rid of a few old files, I just type DEL instead of DELETE. It saves a lot of time but there is a price. Each command that you COPY takes up about one block of space. You can RENAME commands, but programs need them under their old names, so be careful.

## More Tips

## Bryce Nesbitt Again, Berkeley, CA ALIGNING PRINTER PAGE

After printing a file to your printer, you may find that the page is not aligned to the top of the next page. To send a top-of-form code to your printer type the following from CLI. page.

## COPY * TO PRT

then press CIRL I. then CTRL In. then RETURN.

## ASSIGN

As you may or may not know, you can assign logical volume/device names to the physical disk drive names such assign Source: dfO: assign Destination: Df1: diskcopy source: to destination:

Useful? Yes, for some things. Did you know you can also assign logical volume/device names subdirectories? to assign from: df0 devs/printer assign to: ram: copy from: to to:

But the FUN one you may not have noticed is that you can assign to FILE HOt BATE

names (read commands). For example:

assign x: ciexecute assign e: cied assign ce: dfl:c/L.C

Then use them in this fashion.

*istartup-sequence eimy \_text\_file cc: foo -i dff:include

Assigns are SYSTEM WIDE, not unique to each window.

## Creating Data Disks

Bill Ott, St. Petersburg, FL

I have a quick mini-program that makes data disks for me. Using ED. create the following file.

echo "Formatting Drive DF1:" format drive dfl: name "Empty" echo 'Installing DF1:" wait 4 secs Install df1: echo "Installed copy finished."

Save this file with a name kile FORMA 1 and when you need it just execute forma 1. Make sure you have an empty disk in DFI: rather than something you want to save, In the long run this may save you a little time and effort.

## THE NEW CONSULTANT

## Scott Price

CCCC, Inc., Tucson, AZ

The New Consultant from Batteries Included is a · database management system for the 64 and now for the 128 in either 40 or 80 column mode. Both versions are included on the diski the 128 version will auto-boot upon powerup, but you must load the 64 version. The program also will run on CBM 8032, CBM 4032, and the PET 2001 (with 32K expansion) computers with the addition of a replacement ROM chip, It will run with one or · two 1541/1571'5 or a dual drive system (4040, 8050, or 8250 › The 64 version will also work in 80 column mode providing you have one of the column adapters on the market. Batteries Included markets one of these. The program disk is not write protected and a back-up should be made for your work disk, saving the original for future back-ups. You must also format data disks for your use, and this is supported by the program. Batteries Included, instead of protecting the disk, chose to protect their program by the inclusion of a · dongle which you must plug into a joystick port before loading the program. It will not work without this "key".

The New Consultant is a fullfeatured, quite powerful database management system. Instructions for creating record formats, entering data, and doing sorts/reports are straight-forward and easy to execute. The manual is thorough and easy to follow, as it guides you step-by-step through the processes needed to get your database up and running quite quickly, and leaving the more advanced procedures until later when you are more familiar with the terms and the capabilities of a database, I could find no fault with The Consultant on the structuring or ease of use in accessing records. It is efficient and one can become quite proficient in using it in a matter of hours.

Some good features that I noticed were the inclusion of 10 pre-formatted templates that you can use for your filing needs. Some of the templates included are Mail List, Inventory,

Catalog, Recipes, Library, and Car, You . may not want to use these at all, but they way serve you as a tutorial to give you some ideas that you would like to incorporate into your own file formats. Another feature I liked was the support programs included on the disk. REL-READ to read the contents of relative files. HDR-READ displays a file definition of any file you choose, showing the number of fields with the number of the field, its name, type, and length of each field.

I liked the ability · to backup the master disk, but in order to do that a high price must be paid. I refer to the atorementioned dongle, In a word, dongles are a "pain". For instance, on the 64 the dongle must be inserted in port 1, while on the 128 it must be in port 2. As I sometimes use one computer, sometimes another, 'which port does it go in this time?' Secondly, if you are also a user of Paperclip, a separate dongle must be used for that program. So while both prograus claim to support each other, (files may be transferred from one to the other), I think unplugging one dongle, replacing it with another and rebooting the other program to be a "pain", I prefer the method that Superbase and Super script 128 uses, namely, that both programs are resident in the computer simultaneously, and you just toggle back and forth between the two. alternative for Paperclip/Consultant would be to have one dongle that supports both programs so that the plugging/unplugging would be eliminated. Also, while I'm complaining I might mention that, although the manual is quite well done, my version included not one but two addenda, which must constantly be consulted (pun intended) while trying , to learn the program, again a "pain": Hopefully, future versions be updated into a complete manual that can be read from start to finish.

If you are looking for a powerful database manager, The Consultant certainly ranks with the best among those for the 64/128. It is well thought out and well written.

## 1521 ROM UPDATE

## Jason Auvenshine

commodore recently made a ROM fix available for the 1571 Disk Drive. The new ROM is being installed in all new 15715 now, but those of us who bought our 15715 before the new ROM was being used now have the option of upgrading.

There were many bugs in the old ROM, some serious and some trivial. One of the most noticeable was the time it took a 1571 in 1571 mode to begin reading from a single-sided disk. This bug has been fixed and the speed increase is very nice. Another one of the 'nuisance' type bugs was the BAM re-write bug. This caused the BAM on the backside to be rewritten every time a new block was written to the disk. This slowed things down significantly, but has been fixed in the new ROM. Also, when doing a GCR read in burst mode, the active LED did not come on in the old ROM.

The old ROM would not load scratchprotected files in burst mode, which made them next to impossible to get to it they were on the back side of the disk. Also, retries were not done in burst mode, which could sometimes return read error when it was not really there. Another nuisance was the fact that, due to the BAM swap bug, the drive could lock up if the maximum number of files was open. And, in CP/M mode, the motor took too long to accelerate when reading an MFM disk, causing read errors.

All these bugs have been fixed as well. There were also some potentially damaging bugs in the old ROM. One of these was the , legendary SAVE-withreplace bug. This has been fixed. and SAVE "Difilename' is (supposedly!) finally safe. Also, the set overflow flag was not disabled when exiting from the 1571 controller routines, which caused seemingly random problems, usually with RELative files. Also, validating a doublesided disk in 1541 mode would cause the back side of the unavailable, and without direct disk editing, it was impossible to recover the back side of a disk. These two especially nasty ones have been fixed in the new ROM.

Many other miscellaneous bugs were fixed as well and the new ROM itself appears to be fairly well bug-free. The new ROM doesn't give you any extra features: it only allows you to properly use the ones which your drive was supposed to have in the first place. If you have been experiencing any of those bugs. you have the old RÖM and should consider upgrading.

Other than that, I recommend that all 1571 owners be sure they have the new ROM in their drive. This will protect your disks and possibly YOUR sanity!

There is only one major problem I know of with having the new ROM installed in your 1571. With the new ROM installed. Fast Hack'em (a third party copy program) will no longer work with the drive. Since the makers of Fast Hack'em seem to have stopped, the chances of a new release to fix this problem are slim. If you use Fast Hack'em frequently, you may want to check into using another program before you have the ROM installed.

## WAIT FOR KEYPRESS

## Rick Swallow

WAIT 653,4 causes a program · to pause until the CONTROL key is pressed. You'll find that, if you use 1.2, etc. in place of the 4, the program will wait until other key(s) are pressed. A 5, for example, causes a pause until either CONTROL or a SHIFT key is depressed. Experiment with it. Here's a short progra to help you play with · it. Just type it in and run it. After finding out the key or keys the WAIT allows, change the number after the 653 and go again.

```basic
10 PRINT CHR$(147) 'PRESS KEYS TO SEE WHICH ONE ALLOWS PRG TO GO ON' 
20 WAIT 653,1

KEY IT WAITS FOR?'

30 PRINT 'ARE YOU SURE THAT'S THE ONLY
```

The CHR$(147) in line 10 causes the screen to clear. See the CHR$ chart in your user's manual. You can't hurt your computer by typing in weird numbers. Note: I got some very interesting results--this is fun!]

## Function Keys on the 128

## D. Smither

## Sacramento, CA

to execute more than one function on one key, For example:

LIST 100-1000

LOAD "NAME",8

will load the specified program, then list the specified lines. If this were tried using a function key program on the C64, only the load function would be performed as these programs most often only execute up to the first carriage return. The rest chopped or, as in this case, after loading a program the computer does not return control back to the string assigned to the function key.

First, a bit of fun. We may all know that by pressing the SHIFT RUN/STOP key, the first program listed in the directory will load and run automatically. But to place our function key program at the top of the directory requires either some copy and rename work or some look ahead planning to be sure this will be the first program placed on a freshly formatted disk. Instead, let us use the default function key settings to our advantage and not worry about where the function key program sits in the directory. The only concern is that the name of the function key program have one of the following names: DIRECTORY, SCNCLR, RUN, LIST MONITOR. Of the five, I prefer SCNCLR and here is why. When the computer is first turned on or is reset, Function Key #2 has DLOAD" assigned to it. Function Key #4 has SCNCLR (ret) and Function Key #6 has RUN (ret). Now this is very easy to do. Press in rapid succession F2. F4 and F6. You do not have to wait for the computer to catch up. This is the result.

On the 128 we way, at any time, assign a string to a function key, either in direct mode or within a program. The easiest method in the extreme is to set up a routine in the boot block of a diskette, but that is beyond the scope of this article, Instead, we will simply load and run a program of function key assignments.

DLOAD"SCNCLR(ret) SEARCHING FOR O:SCNCLR LOADING READY. RUN(ret)

## READY

The function key assignments that you have specified in your program are now engaged As for the program itself, the following are my favorite assignments.

## 10 KEY1."DLOAD[18 CRSR Rights]"

+CHR$(27)+"Q"+CHR$(13)

Function Key #1 has the load-a-file command. If this key is used · in conjunction with the directory listing, the word DLOAD is printed over the blocks number, the cursor skips over the file name, the ESC Q deletes everything from the cursor to the edge of the screen (namely, PRG) and the line is entered with the character 13.

## 20 KEY2 "SCRA'T'[18CRSR Rights]" +CHR$(27)+"Q"+CHR$(13)+"Y"+CHR$(27) +"Q"+CHR$(157)

Function Key #2 has the scratcha-file command. If this key is used in conjunction with a directory listing, the word SCRAT (shifted T) is printed over the blocks number, the cursor skips over the file name, the ESC Q deletes everything from the cursor to the edge of the screen and this part of the line is entered with the character 13. The 128 will ask you to affirm your intention to scratch and you do so by pressing the return key.

I KEY3 [CLR][BLKJDIR'[CYNJUB"+CHR$ (13)+"[2 CRSR Up][BLK] WINDOW 40.0, 79,24,1"+CHR$(13)+DI'R'[CYNJU9"+ CHRS(13)+"[2 HOME]

Function Key #3 has the directories. My system consists of two drives and I often need to see the. directories of both of them. Function Key #3 will print drive 8 and window drive 9 on the right side of the same screen.

## 50 I KEYS "DSAVE|18 CRSR Rights]"+CHR$ (27)+"Q"[16 CRSR Lefts]

Function Key #5 has the save-afile command. If this key is used in conjunction with the directoy listing, the word DSAVE is printed over the

blocks number or SCRAT, the cursor skips over the file name, the ESC deletes everything from the cursor to the edge of the screen and the cursor skips back to the first letter in the filename. This allows you to edit the filename if you wish.

## 70 KEY7,"OPEN4,4:CMD4:LIST"+CHR$(13)+ "P'R'4:CLOSE4"+CHR$(13)

Function Key #7 has the list-toprinter command. The appropriate commands cause the computer to list the program in memory on the printer rather than screen.

Please note that nothing has been placed on Function Keys #4, #6 or #8.

## What's T.H.I.S? cont'd from Page 5

Program expansion is already in the works for those of you unable to get enough of T.H.I.S. New editions will expand the program up to four times its original size. The function key set is the doorway to linking T.H.I.S. not only to the new editions, but also to other graphic-related programs. There is access to a font generator, an animation program and even the "Trade Show Caddy," a combination of user-friendiy software for displaying product lines.

## TALK TO YOUR PRINTER

## George Pope

any of us talk to our printers on a regular basis, HOWEVER, much and distributed Co a tamiy Pridience f distributed audience. hope the following will help those of you that want to learn what your printer can do for you rather than what you Pere is used role not be gualted to write the article. Confused? Me too now!

Down to basics. There are essentially two kinds of printers - Commodore and non-Commodore. Some are easy to identity. Non-Commodore REQUIRE a separate interface between the printer and the computer. Now comes the first curve. Commodore printers either marketed with the with t Commodore Logo OR are in such a manner as to NOT require a separate interface. To summarize:

## Non- Commodore

Require separate interface (Okidata 92, 192, Panasonic 1091, 1092, Star-Micronics SG10, NX-10 &amp; more)

## Connodore

By Commodore (1526, 1526, 801, &amp; more)

## Others

Confused? Most are. The Commodore type printers that are marketed under a nonCommodore name (SGIOC, Oki120) have interface logic built in so that they 'emulate' a Commodore printer. Most commonly, the Commodore 1525 is the printer they emulate. The 1525 was the earliest printer available to plug directly into the C-64 computer. Unfortunately it became the 'standard' for compatilbility I 'unfortunately' because so many printers do so much more better and faster. At the time, the 1525 was great, but as with most things in the world of computing, the developments don't stand still very long and machines made to an antiquated standard rapidly become obsolete.

‹Okidata 120, Star-Micronics SG10C, SL10C &amp; more)

THE 1525. A good little machine when introduced, it will print double size and will do Commodore graphics. It will not vary from its 10 cpi (characters per

CCCC, Tucson, AZ

inch horizontal format) except double size. It will not underline or print variable vertical spacing, NIQ. etc.

DIHER PRINTÉRS that 'emulate' the 1525 generally do so very well and the problem arises only when you must make the printer do things that the 1525 will not, such as underline or 17 cpi type. However, this is suitable for the needs of some people.

## PRINTERS

side from coming to you through a wide assortment of manufacturers and with a variety of capabilities, they also come in various leveis of JUNK ratings. I am not going to get into the rating of individual printers in this article, merely point out generically some strong points and weaknesses, as well as trade-offs that are out there in the marketplace. This is intentional since my junk way be someone else's treasure and that is not the point of this article.

Other printers must have a separate interface. We now have a computer in the computer talking to a computer in the interface talking to a computer in the printer. No wonder they get confused. Since the success or failure of a computer routine is dependent upon the ability of the programmer doing the programming, we get a variation in the degree of success that these machine conversations achieve.

If a printer plugs directly into the Commodore computers (C-64, C-128), it is commonly referred to as a 'Commodore compatible! This means that the computer memory built into the printer makes it behave like a Commodore (for some this is enough).

The Non-Commodore printers come " in roughly two standard configurations. Serial and parallel. Now some more confusion. Commodore routinely addresses its printers through the 'serial' port (same as the disk drive). Do we therefore need a serial printer. NO! repeat NO!. The interfaces are so set up as to take the serial output from the Commodore computer and translate it to the configuration necessary to properly · feed the 'parallel' requirements of the printer. Specifically the 'Centronics parallel'

requirements of the printer. For the record, non-Commodore 'serial' printers can be made to work with the Commodore output through the R5232 port of the Commodore. This is the port commonly used for the modem, located at the left rear of the computer as you face it from the keyboard side.

Generally the 'serial' printer costs more and is more difficult to interface, The Commodore 'RS232' port is not the same as the 'RS232' referred to generally in the industry. Tradeoffs include speed, type style, type size, line spacing, graphics compatibility, cost. and interface requirement as generally the most important. I didn't say it was going be easy. Briefly, data is sent 'serial' device one · bit at a time like long freight train. A 'parallel' device normally deals in batches of bits, eight at a time, and is therefore normally faster: It is somewhat academic when we deal with printers for home computers since the printer is terribly slow when compared to the speed of the computer. It can make a difference in other peripherals such as the disk drive.

## INTERFACES

hese devices interpret the signal frOll the computer for the · printer. They do so in a variety of ways and at a variety of speeds. Few interfaces are fully compatible with all printers, In fact, anytime anyone associated with the computer industry says that something is 100% compatible, he is usually either lying or terribly illinformed. Some interfaces have tiny dip switches that allow you to mechanically make selections from the variety of options available within the interface, Others only offer software (type in your own direct computer commands) changes, and some offer a variety of combinations of both. Needless to say, there is a fantastically broad selection to choose from or be confused by. My personal selection is an interface that can be either programmed or forced to the configuration that I want. Another option offered within the variety of interfaces available include variable size buffers that allow the interface to accept output from the computer speeds (very fast) and hold the data for the relatively slow printer. Naturally the bigger the buffer, the more it will hold, and successful transfer is dependent upon the software being utilized in the computer. There are fast and slow word processors and other programs too for that matter. At least one interface offers the option of loading different type fonts (styles) into the buffer space and then accessing those different fonts for printer output. A word of caution here is that it doesn't necessarily work with all printers. Still another case of 'buyer beware'

Let's get down to brass tacks! Would you believe direct commands? ASCIT

Of the printer problems I have been asked about, the vast majority can be traced to an interface that never should have been released for public consumption. The tradeoffs include speed, buffer, compatibility, convenience, and to a slight degree cost.

All printers understand commands in a common manner. Specifically, they rely on ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to receive their commands. Unfortunately, Commodore ASCII is not the same as standard ASCII (thus the need for the interface to make the interpretation). Generally, ASCII values below about 30 are understood by the printer to be commands for it to do something. Above 30 they normally refer to a letter or number or the like. Now 30 numbers is not a great deal for telling the printer what to do and greatly limits the

![Image](1987_12_artifacts/image_000011_fed54916a0176953af3883a56d8ff2172049731395633376a5ab99fba44a0b6b.png)

options. The solution was an · 'ESCAPE' code. This is normally an ASCII 27 and indicates to the printer that the code that comes down the line next is not to be printed, rather it is an additional command we get the ability many more command codes to the 10 to one printer a totally different effect on 'families' of printers have grown up. The two most common within the Commodore community that I am familiar with are the 'Epson' which includes as a minimum the Epson, Star-Micronics, and Panasonic brands, as well as others that use similar ASCII coding. The second is the Okidata group. Even within a group, or for that matter a single manufacturer, codes will vary from machine machine little idiosyncrasies. · Generally the computer sends ASCII code printer via the Basic command CHR$(n) where the n equals : the ASCII decimal number, e·g·r CHR$(27). For information,the ASCII used by Commodore is lovingly called either PETSCI or PET ASCII.

## DIRECT COMMANDS

![Image](1987_12_artifacts/image_000012_b4f5d1986f50ed8dc5fdf871b2c85d2e2213c7e15c925ddcc026eb6a70cfa749.png)

ou computers are want them to, only what we tell them ranite thee to and we must do it EVERY time in great detail. They can't be housebroken like a puppy. The command to reach the printer takes the form · of 'PRINT#n'. the n equals a variable that is dependent upon the channel that has been opened to 'talk' through. Many printer owners manuals will confuse us here because they don't recognize the PRINT# format. They talk about LPRINT. Now LPRINI is fine for such inferior machines as the IBM and similarly programmed machines, but it simply doesn't hack it for the Commodore, The printer makers haven't awakened to the fact yet that there are more Commodore computers out there than the other kinds. Herein also lies one of the pittalls of addressing the printer from the Commodore, Normally the Commodore is a friendly computer for program input. It readily accepts commands that have spaces within command sequence and those that don't, unlike many other makers that require space breaks in all commands. When addressing the printer for for that matter the disk) with commands that have a '#' in them

(GET#, PRINT# are examples), the command must have no spaces in it or it will cause a crash because PRINT#, GET# are 'words' in BASIC.

## COMMAND SEQUENCE

n order for a command sequence to reach the printer there is a specific routine that must be followed. FIRST: OPEN2,4 ‹This opens a communications channel to the printer here shown with a 2, and specifies the device 4 which is understood by the computer to be the printer as an 8 specifies disk drive. The communication channel shown here with a 2 is an optional number and a wide range is available, I use the number 2 so that you can readily identify which number I'm talking about. Many use an OPEN4,4 which is acceptable but makes it harder to identify which digit you are addressing. SECOND: PRINT#2/text to be printed' (This command tells the computer to print to communications channel 2 the information inside the quotes. Ail alternate command at this point would be to effect a command direction to the printer in which case the command would look like: PRINI#2CHR5(12) We therefore have a means of getting commands ог text to the printer. When everything has been done at the printer that you want to accomplish, we are then ready for the third step). THIRD: PRINT#2 CLOSEZ (Again ve address the communication channel 2 and not the device number. In fact, we have only addressed the device in the original command and the computer remembers that communications channel 2 is for this series of commands reserved for device #4 - the printer. A good rule of programming comes into play here. When you OPEN something, it must be CLOSEd. Here the PRINT#2 command serves to clear the buffer in the printer and prevent its contents from screwing up future activities and then closes the channel off from further use until specifically opened by another direct command.) The printer is addressed in this manner for almost all activities, and though it may appear more complicated on the surface, in all probability it will look like the above under close analysis. Let's look at a couple of useful routines. One common task that we ask our printers to do is to dump listings to the printer, The same set of commands is used to dump a BASIC program as is used to list the directory from a disk.

![Image](1987_12_artifacts/image_000013_1667696b500919403b3972c1735d4bd6536a74f66643111e6b9b19088dd225be.png)

## The steps are as follows:

1. Load the program to be listed or the disk directory into the memory of the computer.
2. Type OPEN 4:CMD2 LIST and hit the RETURN key. The printer should chug away until the contents have been reduced to little colored marks on the paper:
3. When the printer stops, complete the series with: PRINT#2iclose2 and hit the RETURN key. Notice how familiar the commands sound? The only new items we have added to the set are the CMD command that tells the computer to send future execution commands to the printer and then we tell it to LIST and away it goes. Don't think you've found Shortcut to your programming efforts by using the CMD and then utilizing normal instead of the commands with the # in them. You way get away with it for a while, but ultimately it will jump up and attack you when you least need it. This is contrary to the stuff we were fed four years ago when the 'experts' were asked and we were told it was 'impossible' to do. It ain't impossible, just impractical.

## INTERFACES - A final look

![Image](1987_12_artifacts/image_000014_7a4504d904ccb3ebab2ceced5dff9d40805d8e12e467795da953d106f0a8bb73.png)

ONE: Set the printer configuration that if you change printers you don't have to also buy a new interface.

he interface can allow you to do many things. A good interface will give you the control necessary for the following:

TWO: Be easy to set (change) the mode from emulate to transparent and back again.

THREE: Set the printer for automatic line feed or no line feed so that the printer can be utilized by a variety of programs. Routinely the normal setting is for automatic line feed to be on, and then you may have to change it for certain programs like Print Shop to a no line feed configuration.

FOUR: Device number recognition. The default printer name for Commodore computers is 4. [Except the 1520 printerplotter, which is 6.] Most printer and computers give you the option of having another printer on line at the same time with the identification of 5. Therefore, the interface can be set to talk to the printer as either 4 or 5 as the operator or programmer wishes.

Different specialized interfaces provide other options. The downloadable extra type fonts for one example. Others include the capability of lodging a separate program into the interface so that it controls or modifies the computer output before it reaches the printer and causes other specialized events to occur. The limit is about the same as the limits on the imagination, and I feel confident that as time passes. brilliant programmers and engineers will find more and more exciting things to do with our hardware. As a note, just because your interface doesn't have little dip switches doesn't mean it can't do something. Read your owner's manual again with an eye to what you have learned about your printer since you goi it and in light of this article, You mas be pleasantly surprised by what you can do.

## WORD PROCESSING

![Image](1987_12_artifacts/image_000015_ceab1493fe5fe81b5d3c8977692fc2a461ecba8b31f86e95c038c942d66cd364.png)

ord processing brings out a slight modification to the 'Talk to the Printer' process. It you have a Commodore printer like the 1525, 1526, or 801 for example, there is little you can do as pointed out earlier. A Commodore 'compatible' printer offers a few more options, but you are still limited. A Centronics parallel full-featured printer gives you a wide range of options. There however, a few cautions. How have we learned of these? The hard way. Someone has paid the price for a new printer or interface and learned it was good or bad as the case may be and if bad has taken his or her lumps and learned. The generous ones have shared that information and thereby saved others from the same mistakes. There are good interfaces and there is junk. There are good printers and there is junk. There are good word processors and "surprisingly, while there is some junk, it's not as prevalent as in the aforementioned categories. How do you find out what you need? Talk to others, someone with the combination you think you want and ask about it. If you can't find it, you may decide to be one of the pioneers that finds out about a new product-Back to the topic at hand. Many word processors (WPs) have 'printer files' supplied with the program that can be loaded into the word processor so be loaded into the word processor so that the word processor with a standardized formatting sequence can tell the printer what to do. This is especially

handy for use with a variety of printers since you don't have to do extensive file modification to print out your file. Frequently these same word processors will provide you with the option to customize your own printer file or prepare a file for a printer not their pre-programmed list. Examples include Paperclip, SuperScript. Paperback/Pocket Writer, and Word Pro. Other WPs allow you to customize codes at the head of your document and then call specific functions with a couple keystrokes. Examples here include Paperclip, SpeedScript, Word Pro, and Easy Script.

The purpose of this article is not to tell you how but rather to let you know that it can be done. It simply isn't possible to cover the wide variety of printers, interfaces and WPs even if l had the specific knowledge to do so. It is simply too voluminous and too everchanging. How can you learn? Simple. Generate scrap paper. Fanfold paper comes at about $15 for 2500 sheets locally. You literally have many hundreds of dollars invested in your computer system. It seems a shame that for a couple of dollars in wasted paper you would forego the pleasures of learning the capabilities of your system utilizing them to the fullest. The minimal investment is well worth it. Seems natural you say? I unfortunately have met many · that haven't. Whether they were intimidated by the dumb little beastie or not I can't say. It doesn't

In any case, whether you are setting up a printer file, using a preconfigured file or calling the shots directly, you have the option of specific command sequences to make the printer do what you want it to. I mentioned earlier about the ASCII numbers to functions. These are the commands that must be carefully imbedded into the WP or printer file. They will access those special functions. Many of the better WPs have the ESCAPE (Chr$(27)) function pre-programmed (that saves one code option) and the ESCAPE function combined with one or two additional alpha or numeric codes will get your printer to do everything short of backflips. The printer doesn't see the letter or number following the ESCAPE, rather it takes the ASCII number associated with that letter and performs the function as outlined in the printer control codes section of the printer owner's manual. Sound simple? NO? It really is once you get it working the first time.

hurt to make mistakes on your computer. You will generate scrap paper, perhaps crash a program or two that you can simply reload. You may even get frustrated and talk to your printer the way we mentioned at the start of this article. But hang in there and you can beat it! How do I know? I've been there! So read the owner's manual for your interface and printer, and reread them periodically for new insight into the use the devices. Make your system work for you instead of you working for the system. Invest some time to learn the various capabilities and how to access them. The result will be a payback from your investment, fun with the ability you will gain, and most of all the feelings of success you will experience. HAPPY COMPUTING !!
