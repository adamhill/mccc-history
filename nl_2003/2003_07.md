## 20 th Anniversary Reunion - July 27

This is the month that we'll celebrate the 20 th anniversary of the founding of our club. Things are still coming together. I'm still trying to contact some of our officers from prior years, and so there's a chance that the get-together could be even larger. At this point, it looks as though we'll have between 75 and 100 people attending. One correction from last month's newsletter… the hours will be from 2:00 to 5:00 . Last month's hours were a typo. Guess I need an editor.

## Admission

None. The club will pick up the expenses of the meeting room and the food. All we ask is that you show up ready for a good time.

The Place

As mentioned last month, we will hold our reunion get-together in the same location that we normally have our annual Fleamarket - The Brookside Community Center in Hurst. The address is 1244 Brookside Drive. You'll find a link to a map on the club website.

The Date and Time We'll gather between the hours of 2:00 and 5:00 pm on Sunday, July 27.

## Who'll Be There?

As mentioned above, we are expecting between 75 and 100 people to attend based on the number who have expressed an interest in being kept informed. I'm still trying to contact officers from years past. If you are in contact with any exmembers, please let them know about the reunion and have them contact me at billr@amigamccc.org or (972) 660-7042 - or just let me know how to contact them and I'll do what I can.

What We'll Do We'll visit and catch up on old times. We'll enjoy snacks, pizza and soft drinks. We'll play with our favorite computers from years gone by.

What You Can Do If you have an old C64, C128, some flavor of Amiga or any other PC from our past - and if you'd be willing to bring it on that day, please contact Mark Stodola at (469) 575-0451 or email him at mcs@amigamccc.org.  The more computers we have to play with, the better time we'll have.

What About the Fleamarket? Yes, we'll still have a fleamarket. We have reserved the Brookside Community Center on November 1 for our annual event.

## Capabilities

We approach the threshold of the next generation of Amiga computing. The Pegasos machine and MorphOS are out and moving forward nicely, it would seem. A new set of screen-shots showcasing the GUI of Amiga OS 4.0 appear rather nice eye-candy-wise, though it remains to be seen if the foundation of the revamped OS will match its shiny facade.

It's interesting to think back on the infancy of Commodore's Amiga, when the vast majority of machines had one megabyte of RAM or less, and were lucky to have more than one floppy drive, let alone a hard drive. I'm amazed that I was able to do as much with a system like that as I have, producing animations with jokes and stories, capable of running on a one-meg machine and living on a single DD-floppy disk. Recently, I've taken on the task of converting several of my old animations from the Amiga-only Moviesetter and ANIM formats to the more universal MPEG standard. As part of this, I've been loading and modifying my old anims to facilitate this process, shuffling the frames like cards. The Amiga I've been using to do this has 64 megs of RAM, and a few gigabytes of hard drive space, very modest by any modern standards for computer hardware, but I realized that I'm easily and routinely doing things with animation I wouldn't have dared to even conceive on my older machines with their smaller capacities and slower processors. That machine isn't even my best one.

There are a number of things that PC owners do easily that we can't or can do with some stubborn determination. We've been aware that Amiga has been behind in the realm of simple specs and horsepower for years, but not all of us may know how much of a difference that horsepower can make, even if no other facets of our Amigas were changed. The Amithlon emulator for PCs has given us a taste of what it's like to take the raw speed and storage of the garden-variety PC and apply it to an Amiga. PegasOS and (presumably) the Amiga One will do much the same, adding some new dimensions to the Operating system and its relation to the hardware. With some software applications that allow users to make the best of the power of the machine, we'll really see something special, enabling creativity at a level undreamt of by today's Amiga users.

## Editor's Comments

At the Amiga By-The-Loop chapter meeting last month, we had our first look at a Pegasos computer running MorphOS. It was nice to see a new machine at long last running an Amiga OS. Here's hoping that trend comtinues.

Remember, the meeting date for the Amiga By-TheLoop Chapter has been changed for June and July. For those two months we'll meet on the second Wednesday of the month. After that, we'll be back to our regular schedule of the second Monday of the month.
