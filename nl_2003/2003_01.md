The move is part of our continuing effort to save money. The old meeting room was costing far too much money for our current membership to support. Thanks go to Ned Kelly for

Interstate 20, and about 2 miles south of Interstate 30. Once at the campus, follow the map on the front page to find the University Center - E.H. Hereford building. It's the one with the circle around it. We have been asked to park in the lots just north of the building, which are marked 'F-12' and '38' on the map. The campus police will be notified that we'll be there so we won't be ticketed. (Ordinarily a parking sticker is required.) Once inside the building, look for the Pedernales Room on the second floor.

Hope to see you there. Word is, we may have an Amiga One there, although it will probably still be running Linux.
