## Fleamarket 2003, November 1

Background

This year we are putting on our club's seventeenth annual Amiga computer show. So come join us and show your support for the Amiga.

Where: The Brookside Convention Center Hurst, Texas When: Saturday November 1, 2003 Time: 1:00 PM until 4:00 PM Admission: Free

Amiga Flea Market Amiga hardware and software from members and non-members will be available for sale. For those of you familiar with how we have done things in the past, this year we are doing things a little bit differently. The officers are tired of collecting things, marking them, holding them until the day of the show, delivering them, and then having to keep an eye on them as the buyers browse around. So this year we are leaving it all up to you. Anyone who has items for sale will need to rent a table, bring their stuff the day of the show, and watch over it themselves. Tables are available for the price of $1 for members and $2 for nonmembers. Please make arrangements in advance for your tables. If you have any questions about this new arrangement, please contact one of the officers. Buyers: I feel certain that the sellers will accept cash. Any other arrangements are between the buyer and the seller.

Demos And Stuff We will have a least one AmigaOne on hand running WinUAE. We had hoped that AmigaOS 4.0 for the AmigaOne would be available, but that is not looking too good at the moment. David Lund of StartUp-Sequence will also be there demoing his Pegasos machine and MorphOS 1.4.

Other Attractions I am hoping to have some CDs available containing the club's complete collection of Amiga software for sale.

A special on memberships will be offered: thirteen months for the price of twelve.

Genesi is pleased to announce that there will be two Pegasos presentations at user groups in Texas this October! We've got a state and a presentation so big we need to do it twice!

David Lund of the AmigaMCCC will be demonstrating the Pegasos on October 13 th at the University of Texas at Arlington

Alex Bartonek of the Central Texas Amiga Computing Society will present the Pegaos in a demonstration on October 20 th at 6:30pm at the group meeting in Austin, Texas.

The focus of these events are the Pegasos and its strong Amiga compatibility! Commonly available Amiga software programs will be demonstrated on the Pegasos at this event and attendees will have a chance to question David about the Pegasos and his experience with this exciting new platform.

The Pegasos is the new PowerPC computer system from

Genesi and supports both G3 and G4 PowerPC processors. The Pegasos is a highly affordable computer system based on the CHRP standard and supports at least seven flavors of Linux including Debian, Mandrake, Gentoo and others.

To compliment the Pegasos and provide a complete solution, Genesi has developed MorphOS - an Amiga compatible, preemptive multitasking operating system. MorphOS combines a modest footprint with scalability, high performance, and amazing ease of use for developers and end users. It's beautifully designed interface and modular object-oriented design offers a modern solution out of the box.

Some operating systems work through emulation
