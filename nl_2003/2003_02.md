## New Meeting Place for Amiga-North-Dallas

Location: Junkins Electrical Engineering Building, Southwest corner of Dyer and Airline Extension roads on the SMU campus. The Junkins building has entrance doors on all four sides. The name 'Junkins' is cut into the stone wall of the buliding over some of the entrance doors.

Room: Meeting room is the Berry Cash Seminar Room 110 on the main (ground) floor, at the east side of the lobby (east side entry doors are on both sides of this room).

Parking: I strongly recommend parking in the visitor area of the multi-floor garage building at the southeast corner of SMU

I have reserved a meeting room for us on the main (University Park) SMU campus for the third Thursday of each month. I have been promised that the meeting room will be unlocked from 7:30 PM onward on these nights, and that the building will be open until 10 PM. Our first meeting there will be Thursday evening, Feb. 20. We can evaluate this location and either continue there or look for other alternatives. Gerald I Ford

(Note of caution regarding street names on maps: There is another road named Airline that starts two blocks north of the area of interest, but it is parallel to and one block west of Airline Extension. Note that the Mapquest map you will get from the URL has the road name Airline incorrectly labeled on the road actually named Airline Extension on the street signs.

## Editor's Comments

I guess this is a year for new meeting places. First the Amiga-By-The-Loop Chapter changed its meeting place last month - now it's time for the AmigaNorth-Dallas Chapter to follow suit. Here's hoping the North Dallas location works out as well as the new ABL location. The room at UTA is much cleaner and more professional looking than our old digs at North Richland Hills. Heck, they even set up chairs for us to sit in. Imagine that! The single disadvantage is that the room can be difficult to locate. Look toward the southwest end on the building on the second floor.
