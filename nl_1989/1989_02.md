## New Stuff I Just Got Amiga Software Reviews by Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

## Deluxe Print II - Electronic Arts

I waited for it a long time I originally ordered it in April,

For those who are unfamiliar with Deluxe Print, the program allows you to produce Signs, Labels, Banners, Letterheads, Calendars, and Greeting Cards. On entering the Deluxe Print Il, you select which format you want and go from there. In any of the formats, the options are much the same.

1988 when it was first announced that it was available I finally got it late November. A long wait, but such is the way of software development The only real question is: how does it perform now that it is finally here!

ICONS: The icons used by Deluxe Print Il refer to clip-art which can be placed anywhere on your document. You select the clip to be used, place it where you want it, and then move it to exactly the right position. Improvements in ll? First of all, your icons can now be in full color. Doesn't mean a whole lot for those of us still using black and white printers, but for the growing number of people using devices like the HP PaintJet, this will be a major improvement. The icon editing is also much improved. But the most Impressive change is that you may now sist your 1con The sizing is very powertu You select the size tool, grab the icon by the corner with your mouse pointer, and pull fou may make it either smaller or larger and it does not hare to have to remain proportional You can make it wider and shorter at the same time. The image processing is quite remarkable. You may change it as many times as you like without noticeably reducing the image clarity, !

am impressed. I have never seen image sizing work as well in any other program.

BORDERS. Allows any design to be used as a border around the document. Major changes are much the same as in ICONS: The borders are in color, the editor is improved, and the border can be sized. Like the ICON sizing, when you size the border, the image being used to produce the border is re-sized to fit in the available space

TEXT: This option allows you to place text anywhere in the body (not in the border) of your document As in the original Deluxe Print, you can specify the color of the text Major improvements include the ability to use fonts other than the standard fonts on the disk and the same wonderfully powerful sizing option available for ICONS

BACKGROUND: This is the option which allows you to pull in a standard IfF picture to use as g backdrop for the rest of your document ICONS and TEXT are superimposed on any picture imported But control over these pictures is much greater than in the original Deluxe Print You may now flip the picture horizontally or vertically, move it to any position you desire, size it, or cut just a portion of it to be used.

So far it sounds great doesnt it? And it is great But I haven't gotten to the bed parts yet. There are two major flaws in the program (at least two that I have discovered). The first clue to the first is on the box that the package comes in it says Supports 12 workbench printers". It means what it says. 13 workbench printer drivers and device are not supported. If you attempt to use the 13 drivers and

device you will have to re-boot. The consequences of this are quite obvious I you have a printer that is supported on 13 workbench, but was not on 12 workbench, you are out of luck. And even if your printer was supported, you will find yourselt printing at I speeds. (Printing out a 4 page banner clocked in at 40 minutes on my printer - I would have expected 15) This is not great news, particularly from a program that didn't hit the market until after 13 was released. This also is the only program I am aware of that even knows what printer driver is being used. Poor design guys.

My recommendation? If you can get by with 12 drivers, it is well worth the money. The graphic handling capabilities are exceptional Just be prepared to keep those font directories small

And speaking of poor design (make that abominable design), Deluxe Print II still suffers from the dreaded "Big Menu Syndrome". As 1 mentioned earlier, the program is capable of pulling in fonts other than the standard fonts that come on the disk. The problem is that if there are too many, the resulting menu will scroll off the bottom of the screen and your system will crash Three years ago, when the Amiga was new, we accepted this from blectronic Arts and learned to make sure our font directories remained small Nowadays, Electronic Arts is the only software developer i am aware of that still hasnt figured out how to handle this problem. Don't they have an Amiga? Don't they turn it on?

## Ram Copy VILS - Micro Systems International

Ill keep this short, fre you looking for the ultimate copy program? One that will make copies of all those programs that you have been unable to back up so far? Look somewhere else!

Copies are slow. Plan on eight minutes for a single disk when you are copying protected software currently have four disks in my library that I have been unable to copy using other programs. After spending eight minutes on each of them, I discovered I couldn't copy any of them using RawCopy. Then 1 tried copying a program that I have already backed up using Project D. RawCopy wouldn't bandle that one either.

1 am told that there are, in fact, software titles that RawCopy will copy, I am also told that it will even remove the protection from some titles. If this is true, then it appears to me that the documentation needs to spell out which ones they are because, at eight minutes per copy, I have neither the inclination nor patience to find out for myself

Une last word Kawcopy is incapable of copying itself (yes, it is copy protected) Project D copies it just fine, thank you.

My recommendation? Save your money,

## World Class Leader Board - Access Software

I am not a golfer. The closest I come to a golf course is when I pass one on the highway. But there is something very entertaining about about playing computer golf. Maybe it's the need for a little lowkey entertainment - Something where I don't have to concentrate while solving adventure game puzzles or tax my reflexes while zapping aliens. I had two computer golf games previously. Mean 18 is a very nice game but has graphics so poor that headaches are a constant danger. World Tour Golf looks good but the game play is very inaccurate, allowing you to aim only in huge jumps and sometimes showing the ball rolling directly over the bole. So I kept looking

Your normal view, as in the other golf games, is from behind the golfer, looking toward the pin Unlike other golf games, the same viewpoint is maintained while putting There is a gadget provided at all times which allows selection of an overhead view. This view shows your current position and makes a suggestion as to the proper club to use. Aiming the ball is accurate, allowing adjustments of

World Class Leader Board combines the best of both worlds. Graphics are excellent - surpassing even those of World Tour Golf. And the game play is as good as Mean 18 The game will handle from one to four players Lach player can select his or her ow Ability Level The KIDS level will not hook, slice, or be affected by the wind - and the correct club 1s automatically selected. The AMATEUR level Will hook or slice but the wind has no affect. The PROFESSIONAL level allows the wind to be a factor and also increases the difficulty of putting

just one screen pixel at a time. Controlling the shot is as easy and accurate as I have seen. Four courses are included with the game and a powerful Course Architect is included which allows you to design your own courses. This also means that other courses will be available in the public domain as other people design them (many are available now in the club library).

I have just one suggestion. The greens are designed with a slope direction and steepness. There is no provision allowing the direction of slope or the steepness to change

My recommendation? Buy it! It may not be the ultimate golf simulation, but it is certainly tops for now and well worth the money. One more thing - the disk is not copy protected so it can easily be placed on a hard drive if you are fortunate enough to have one.

## Where In Europe is Carman Sandiego?

A Software Review by Dick Headley Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Have you ever wished for a computer game that would teach as well as entertain? Well, this is it The Carman Sandiego series, World, USA and Europe, are real winners for all ages. The latest is Europe This is also the best so far. The graphics are very good, and the concept is excellent. If you have not seen this game, the idea is to chase Carman and ber gang of lightfingered badies all over the world, USA or Europe and, if you are careful, cause an arrest or two. There are a large group of ber people on each game and they are pretty clever.

The idea is to read the clues, check your atlas (included) and

figure where to go to catch the thief. There is a time limit, of course, and if you do not get the right warrant, its all in vain The point is that the kids learn geograp lot more fa dua environment", whatever that is We found that the kids really learned and were able to use what they learned in school Things don't get much better than that for us parents and grandparents.

There is a "ball of fame" to record successes that will keep the pressure on There is also a crime lab data base, and a computer to issue warrants.

Documentation is very good and the atlas is necessary. It plays with one joystick, one player at a time It is you against the gang except for the "hall of fame".

I recommend this series, especially the Europe version, highly. Real value for money, as the British say, buy it, dont rent it you will want to keep the records of victory and continue playing for a long time after rental time is expired from one portion of the green to another. This makes it somewhat less than realistic. On the other and, putting tends to be difficul enough and I am not sure that the addition of this feature would add to the playability of the game.

## Doodle Software Review by Robyn Wilson Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Doodle is a hires drawing and graphics program It has many features in its ten modes of graphics such as color changing capabilities, saving and loading of files, and its many easy to read online help screens. With this program it is necessary to use a joystick.

![Image](1989_02_artifacts/image_000005_3aa6df382ef32c34e9da4ab70ac76605fab2508aded3d42817c8c4e98616f823.png)

When the program is loaded, a menu shows up to help you get

the many features of Doodle are the dren o me bones, circles, and characters, others are zoom, copy, and stamp modes. There is also a color mode where you can change colors constantly; both the backeround and the actual color of the line to which you are drawing. Lines, boxes and circles are produced by using a large cross with arrows on the ends. The arrows tell what the outer boundries

There are standard controls that can be used in each of these modes. An example is the grid, which is &amp; set of lines that go vertical and horizontal where you can plot lines and figures. Hit "8" again and your grid disappears and you have a nice graph. You can fill in areas of your work with a solid color by selecting "f" at any time You can also do a mirror image which just flips the whole screen over to the opposite side of the screen or you can use the photo negative which switches the colors from foreground to background Changing the speed of the line being drawn can be done by using "control" and any number one through nine. That can be helpful if you are drawing anything that is detailed are going to be. Zoom can be used to make your drawing larger and enable you to touch up certain areas or to make a detailed drawing. Copy and stamp modes work together with the box mode, that is, you put whatever you want to be copied or stamped into a box, memorize it and put it elsewhere in your drawing.

Doodle is a good drawing graphics program. It is easy for everyone to use It has many uses and features to let you enjoy what you are creating and hours of imagination to go along with it

started, If you go directly to the sketch pad there will be a cross in the middle of the screen. That is what you use to start your drawing. The cross will change by using your joystick with each mode as to whether the cross moves or sets the size of the box or circle or stamps a stamp. It also does the erasing if needed. First you hit the "del" key then use the joystick to put the cross where you want to erase. To get back to drawing use the back arrow

## GVP Controller

## Amiga Hardware Review by Michael Cox

## Reprinted From Amy Today

«The official name of the product being reviewed here is the GVP Multi-Function SCSI/Ram Controller, part number: A2000-2/0&gt;&gt;

After 1 finally decided it was time to buy a hard drive for my A2000, 1 spent much time researching the

Of the two basic types of drives available, both various products of many third party manufacturers.

the ST-506 (originally designed for use in the IBM PC) and SCSI (Small Computer System Interface - used on the Apple Macintosh) drives can be used on the Amiga. An SCSI drive is something of an "intelligent" device, in that it will automatically remap for bad sectors independent of the host, and is considered faster in data transfer than the S1-505 design. Another interesting aspect of sust drives is that they are usually treated as "devices," rather than just disk drives. The advantage of this is that an SCS! controller will be able to "talk" to other peripherals without baring to define a new protocol. This enables one to use optical storage devices (among other things), in the future what the compenies had to offer. While many of the third party manufacturers have similar products, only one offered something that none of the others bad. Great Valley Products, of Paoli, Pennsylvania, has incorporated a space for RAM memory expansion on some of their controllers, effectively allowing you to save the use of an expansion slot in the 2000 As l already had one memory board in my Amiga, adding a hard drive controlier and &amp; separate memory board would normally use up three of the five slots. With the GVP controller, I could expend my system to 5 Mytes and still have three open slots.

Having decided on an SCSI-type drive, I looked at

In my research, I talked to owners of many brands of controllers; Commodore A2090 owners, along with users of Supra, Cltd, and other configurations, While the majority of these people had seen little or no difficulty with their controllers, only one brand stood out as being the most trouble-free. This was the GVP

Impact controller.

three different designs. One design is their "hardcard" This is a controller card with room on the card to physically mount a 35 inch hard drive This has the advantage of leaving your 525 inch drive bay open for such things as the floppy disk drive that comes with the Bridgeboard, for instance No expansion memory is available on-board. The other two cards use remotely mounted drives, either in the drive bay or external to the miga (or both), Both can support up to seyen SCs. peripherals, with the main difference between the two being the amount and type of memory they can hold

I found that the Impact controller was available in

The controller I purchased (A2000 2/0) has sockets for 321 Mbit RAM chips (256Kx4 configuration), for a total of 2 Mbytes of additional memory. This memory can be added in 1 MByte chunks, or 16 chips at a time. The other controller (A2000 1/0) uses 250Kxl RAM chips. These are the chips that have been making the news for the last two years (as their price to the consumer went from soul each to a high of over $15.00) Small lots of these chips currently sell for $1200 each To fully populate this 1 meg card, 32 of these chips are required. Howerer, similar to the 2 MByte board, you have the options of either installing half (or all) the memory at once, or just using the controller sans memory (and wait for the RAM prices to drop).

The included installation software was very

I felt the documentation for the GVP controller was aboye average my only real complaint is that the 2l page bookiet was actually for the faull Lu model, with &amp; 1 page addendum for the 2 MByte board. After an introduction describing the features of the product, the booklet goes on to cover the installation of the controller, drive and software. Additional chapters cover installing fast RAM, multiple SCSI devices, drive partition sizes, and SCSI error handling and correction. The controller's technical specifications were also included.

straightforward and easy to use It automatically recognized my Seogate S1-2T1N 64 MByte drive, and offered to format two 32 MByte partitions. When I chose one 40 MByte and one 24 MByte partition instead, it not only formatted the drive to my specs, but also updated my mountlist to retlect these parameters, The soltware will automatically install Workbench y13 on the drive, and assign it as the sis disk. The software 1 received had WB version 3418 and worked perfectly, though 1 later purchased and installed version 342 (the version that was officially released in October).

The only problem I experienced was quite minor in scope The Seagate has its Drive Activity LED mounted directly to the bottom of its PC board. Since I wanted to see this LED without having to look at the black front plate (comes with the drive) sticking out of my tan Amiga, I simply removed the black plate from the drive, desoldered the LED, attached a 90degree header to the drives PC board, and plugged in the cable from the Amiga's remote hard drive activity

The GVP has a couple of advantages over Commodores new controller, the A2090A. Obviously, the capability of having both memory and controller on the same card is one of them. Furthermore, while both controllers will autoboot with the new yI3 ROMS, only the GVP can truly autoboot an SCSI Seagate drive (The fish has trouble with the Seagates because they take a few seconds longer to initialize. The GVP ROMs take this into account and wait for a signal from the drive betore completing the boot-up. Both Commodore and Great Valley Products controllers require a small partition to boot from when using the FFS (Fast File System) format, since the Amiga cannot recognize FPS directly from the v13 operating system

## Direct Memory Access

Both the A2090A and the GVP controller use DMA (Direct Memory Access) for the transfer of data. · The A2090A does this by using the internal DMA channel in the machine. This causes problems when displaying "severe-overscan", since both functions are handled by the same custom chip, The GVP controllers instead use their own DMA channel to a static 4k on-board cache. This method not only keeps data transfers fast, but by not using the Amiga's DMA channel, it prevents any problems when using a combination ot DMA and overscan

In the two months since I installed the GVP Impact controller, it has run 24 hours per day, with absolutely no errors. iny questions i had for the technical stait were answered while I was on the phone to them often by an engineer. The boot ROMs were shipped to me via UPS Blue Label as soon as Commodore released their Kickstart 13 ROMs. I even found that I could have obtained the same card and drive combo directly from GVP for less than I paid to the dealer I purchased them from, and that dealer had the least expensive set-up of those I had checked (GVP said they even re-work the drive LED before shipping)

## In Summary™.

I have found the people at Great Valley Products to offer something that all computer owners need; great products, and great service, all at a great cost-toperformance ratio.

## Stammering 1571 C-128 Tip from J. Buell Commodore Users of Bartlesville

Tired of your 1571 (original ROM) taking forever to access a single-sided 1541 disk and even longer on a flippy? I have even resorted to locking my 1571 in 1541 mode when I have to deal with numerous flippys. Try this command I found in 1571 INTERNALS (page 127) from Abacus:

## OPEN 15,8,15, UO&gt;RA"CLOSE 15

This will limit to one the number of times your Ird will try and fail to read the flip side of your disk If your program uses a BASIC loader, scratch the old file and seve it again with this command added. Now you do not have to remember the new command to make use of it If your program uses a ml boot, just enter the command manually from within the program after booting.

This command may cause some problems, why else would commercial productivity programs not include it Howerer I have not found and problems yet and it works great added to Multiplan's and Paperclip II=128s BASIC loader.

## Xetec Super Graphix Gold

## C64 Hardware Review by Mike Harvey Arizona Commodore Users Group

Printer interfaces have been improved greatly over the past few years, and one of the best interraces on the market today is the Xetec Super Graphix Gold. (It's pronounced "Zee-Tek".)

The price packs a wallop, but at $120 it may be a very worthwhile investment for your computer and printer. Included in the package is a 32K buffer that allows you to load graphic pictures and them dump them to your printer without tying up you computer There are over 32 choices of printers, four built-in fonts, over 20 secondary addresses and twelve printer channels. A banner channel that allows you to print out custom banners and graphics sideways up to 8* high is also included.

The interface is in a steel case which allows for computer abuse, le, dropping trom desk while changing the dip switches. Two buttons peer from the top of the steel case. One resets the buffer while the second of the two resets the interface itself. An LED on top of the interface enables you to see if information is being sent and received. There are two rows of dip switches. The first allows you to configure the interface for virtually any printer as well as device 4 or 5 and set the printer to 80 or 132 columns. The second set of switches allows for typefaces and print conversions.

The intertace is powered from a wall transtormer but Xetec aiso includes information on how to solder pin 1B on the printer cable, allowing the interface to be powered from the printer itsell be warned, however, that this is a highly delicate task and voids the LIFETIME warranty.

There are four fonts built into Supergold including Near Letter Quality, Helvetica, Broadway, and Script. There are 27 more fonts included on a disk that accompanies the interface, as well as a program that allows you to create/edit your own fonts Once fonts are loaded, they can be enhanced in a variety of ways.

One feature that makes this interface stand out is the ability to detect whether a 1571 is on-line and is using the burst mode of transferring data.

This is quite a complex interface, but taking the time to learn it can only improve the quality of your printer output,

## Empire

## Amiga Software Review by Jeff James Reprinted From The Knightly Knews

This month Im going to review Interstel's latest Amiga software offering, Empire. Empire recently had the distinction of being named "Overall Best Game of 1988" by Computer Gaming World Magazine Does it deserve it?

Empire, first and foremost, is a strategy game. And, to set things straight right from the beginning, Empire is undoubtedly the best strategy game for the Amiga. Period. Gome of the Year? I don't think so, but it comes awfully close.

Empire is a detailed and complex game of global domination. You can play with up to three players, and any or all of these players can be played by the computer. Each player starts out with a very small chunk of a largely unexplored world, and through the course of the game, each player explores the world around him, builds armies, and tries to manufacture the winning combination of combat units. You can create several different combat units; Armies, Fighters, Destroyers, Submarines, Cruisers, Transports, Carriers, and Battleships. All have differing strengths and weaknesses, and all take different amounts of time to manufacture. Generally, the more powerful the unit, the longer it takes to make.

Anyway, to quickly summarize the rest of the games functions, all players continue to explore, build and conquer until only one of them remains as the supreme ruler of the entire planet.

If you like strategy games, youll love Empire. The game can take hundreds of hours to finish; even spending three hours at the start of the game before you even spot an enemy is not uncommon. ‹Editor's comment-this game is definitely NOT for everyones The box has a label warning users about the addictiveness of the game, and believe me, they aren't liars, either! If you're got a lot of free time, Empire is extremely enjoyable.

On the negative side, several parts of the game could use improvement, fi - The graphics on the two screens you see while the program is loading are absolutely horrible. A Cô4 could generate better graphics than what la seen (Empire was ported from the Atari St, so what can I expect?) One screen depicts the cover of the

program box. Why didn't they just digitize the front cover with Digi-View? The disk is only about 80% Tull, so memory woud be no problem fu - When you win the game, all you get for spending 200t hours slaving over your keyboard is a cute little sign sayinę you won On boy; what a peachy keen reward! almost pulled the plug when I saw that was all I got for winning. I'm sure a nice picture with a nice little ditty playing wouldn't take too much memory. #3 The games take too long. Even if you play with the computer, you're likely to spend at least 12 bours playing the game. I wish they had an optional limit on the number of turns you can play.

These minor annoyances aside, Empire is a thoroughly enjoyable game. If you like strategy games, it is a Most HAvEn for those of you that like games short and sweet, shy away from Empire You might find yourself spending weeks playing this highly addictive and engrossing wargame.

## Amiga By-The-Loop Brent Wood

With about 45 members and guests in attendance Membership is on the rise and may soon top last

The meeting in January started about 10 minutes late due to the large crowd and the "close" arrival of our hardware presenters. After brief announcements the new "Dumb Question" box was opened and the first (and only) question of the night was read. The audience tried to give an informed answer and hopefully we didn't confuse the anonymous person who asked it A good start to a new feature since we did not prepare anyone for it ahead of time. This led into a spirited question-answer-rumor period that threatened to take over the entire meeting.

the Loop chapter started 1989 with a bang! years' total Larger quarters (in the same building) may soon be necessary.

Intercomputing showed the latest available incarnation of the Amiga, the A2500. After hearing an all-too-familiar story of how this particular machine came to Intercomputing preceded by three nonworking units, we saw what made it worth the wait. Speed! This baby FLIES thru flight simulators! (Pun intended) Everyone was encouraged to put the machine thru its paces. Thanks to intercomputing for bringing it and a load of software.

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

The demonstration at the January meeting was a hands-on look at the new Amiga 2500 The Amiga 2500, as most of you know by now, is a specially configured 2000, with the 68020 processor, the 68881 math co-processor, 2 additional megs of 32 bit RAM, and a hard drive

We were lucky enough to see it running head to head with Jack Smith's 2000 with CMI Processor Accelerator installed. The 2500 smokes! In a comparison with both machines running Turbo Silver, the 2500 was almost exactly twice as fast. In other applications (Word Perfect and F18/A Interceptor) the difference was smaller but still significant. A very nice demo of Commodore's latest and greatest.

Be sure to attend the February 16 meeting. Same time (730), same place (Arlington Community Center). See you there.

Special thanks to Intercomputing for providing the 2500 for display. And a second thanks for also providing the door prize for the evening,
