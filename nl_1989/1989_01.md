## Quarterback For The Amiga A Software Review by James R. White Reprinted from Brace Bits

guarterback is not a football game! Quarterback is a fast hard disk to floppy backup utility for the Commodore Amiga family of personal computers The program is available for $6900 from Central Coast Software The program is not copy protected, and comes with a 12 page, stapled manual in a plastic folder. Versions tested include version 10 and 12, and was tested on an Amiga 1000 with a 2-Meg MicroBotics ram expansion board and Xebec 20-Meg hard drive using Kickstart 12 with PopCUI-II, Blitzfonts, VDK: and ClicktoF ront all running with a non-standard sized workbench screen. Central Coast Software is the same company that brought us the Disk-2-Disk and DOS-toDOS disk utility programs.

If you have a hard disk, you must back it up (unless you're the kind of person who plays Russian Roulette in your spare time). Trouble is, maintaining a bard drive is a big pain in the patoot Supplied with my hard drive was a backup-restore utility program that worked well, but had several shortcomings, not the least of which was that it backed up read/write errors along with the files, did not allow for selective backup or restore, and would only restore to a bard disk. (Ever consider what would happen if your bard drive ever completely faileds) To get around these shortcomings, I developed a system of doing incremental backups which took 5 - 10 minutes, however this system required much maintenance. Quarterback is the answer to my prayers. I think that in the world of hard disk backup programs, guarterback is second to none in speed, features, and ease of use.

When starting a backup, Quarterback ponders the structure of the hard disk, and builds a catalog of files to backup. It automatically scans down through all levels of the directory tree structure, starting at the device or device/path that you specify. After you have selected which files to back up, Quarterback starts writing the information to floppies as pure data, formatting the disks as it goes. No data compression is performed. This has the advantage of being fast at the expense of requiring more disks - Quarterback typically takes 1 hour to back up a 90% full 20 Meg hard drive to 20 disks. In comparison, the Hardhat disk backup utility can require 8 hours backup a nearly fill hard disk to 13 floppies.

Quarterback uses a little known and poorly documented feature of 12 AmigaDos: the archive bit. Turns out, in addition to the read-write-execute-delete bits associated with each file, there is an archive bit Guarterback uses this bit to determine which files have been backed up and which files haven't In addition to being fast and the use of the archive bit, bere are some Quarterback facts and features which are significant

## FEATURES:

Guarterback uses two floppy drives for backup (if available) with automatic switching, thus no time is lost while you change diskettes.

Quarterback automatically builds and displays a catalog of files for backup and restore, from which you may choose. The catalog is organized by subdirectory, with files listed alphabetically. You click

on a subdirectory name (sorted at the beginning of the list) to list the files in that subdirectory. A "hotscrolling" gadget lets you browse through the list easily. Parent and root gadgets let you quickly move up or down through the subdirectory tree structure. You can click on the file name to include or exclude individual files.

Quarterback provides for Full, Subdirectory, or Individual file backup or restore. You have full control over which files or groups of files to backup or restore. includejexclude files by subdirectory. Include/exclude files by name and or wild card.

guarterback saves and restores empty files and even empty subdirectories (optional).

Quarterback performs incremental backup based on file date or archive bit. It can also mark files as archived so that subsequent backups can ignore unchanged files.

Quarterback estimates the number or floppies needed for backup. It stores files much more efficiently and faster on diskettes that AmigalOS

Quarterback automatically formats diskettes on the fly. There is no added overhead for diskette formatting Guarterback accepts all diskettes, no matter whether they have been previously formatted or not

Quarterback bandles files of unlimited length It handles an unlimited number of subdirectories and an unlimited number of files per subdirectory. It handles up to 9,999 files per backup/restore, and up to 99 backup diskettes.

Quarterback detects AmigaDOS diskettes. It optionally checks each diskette for possible AmigaDos files before it writes on it. This avoids accidental loss of valuable files.

Quarterback sequentially numbers backup diskettes. Each backup diskette is sequentially numbered and date/time stamped. On restore, Quarterback checks the sequence number and date/time stamp of each diskette before restoring files from it

Quarterback validates writes It optionally reads each track of each backup diskette after it is written, providing complete confidence that the backup diskettes are usable.

Guarterback restores original date/time stamp, comments, and protection bits on both files and subdirectories.

Quarterback goes directly to the proper diskette during the restore. During restore, Guarterback reads the backup catalogue from the first diskette of the backup set Thereafter, it goes directly to the proper diskette to find the files you wish to restore, skipping all unneeded diskettes.

Quarterback optionally warns before overwriting existing files or optionally restores only files which already exist (to avoid restoring files which have been permanently deleted from the hard disk).

Guarterback handles errors the way you would expect It provides abort or cancel gadgets at every step in the backup/restore process, It provides many data integrity checks for both backup and restore If guarterback detects a bad diskette during backup, it lets you substitute a different diskette and continues on with no loss of data. During restore, if a diskette cannot be read completely or maybe you can't even find it) Quarterback lets you skip the bad tracks or even the entire diskette, and displays on the screen and on the restoration report the names of files which cannot be restored

Guarterback runs from Workbench or CLl From Workbench, it uses full intuition/mouse interface However, if invoked from CLI with command line parameters or a command file, it runs "mouseless". The latter mode is useful for power users or mouse haters.

Quarterback accepts batch command files and command line parameters. In this mode, Quarterback bypasses the usual "user friendly" windows, going directly to work on the files specified by the command file or command line parameters, using options previously saved by the user in his own parameter file. This feature lets power users exploit the speed and features of Guarterback for quick backups of critical files or subdirectories.

Guarterback prints backup/restore reports This optional report can be directed to either the disk or the printer. This is also a very handy way to document the contents and subdirectory structure of a hard disk.

Quarterback saves your selected configuration options on disk in a parameter file. Choose your

favorite options and save them to disk (a menu option) Quarterback automatically loads these options for all subsequent backups/restores.

Quarterback is mulitasking. It provides easy access to Chl. This lets you do something else while Quarterback fills your diskettes. Quarterback conforms to the guidelines for Amiga mutitasking, using a minimum of memory, and always provides an easy way to abort the backup or restore if you wish

Guarterback works with all AmigaXis compatible hard disk drives. It can also be used with local Area Nets, RAM disks, or even floppy disks.

Quarterback disks, while not AmigaDOS compatible, can be copied using the AmigaDOS DISKCOPY utility program.

## SHORTCOMINGS:

In my view, Quarterback has a few minor shortcomings. These include the following:

Quarterback stores its parameter file, ©BOPT, in the S: directory. Since this file would probably reside on the hard disk, it could get clobbered. I think this should be on the Guarterback disk.

Several last-minute changes were made to the manual after it was printed, and are documented in a file supplied on the Guarterback disk. This file is fairly extensive, and should be printed and kept with the Guarterback manual For $69, I think the user should get a more nearly complete manual.

Quarterback does not support the full wild card options of AmigalOS. Wild cards are limited to ? anywhere in a name and f? appearing once in a name. It also is not possible to exclude whole directories or subdirectories by name.

Quarterback cannot handle a file name of "* (although it will handle file names such as ? or "f?. lo the best of my knowledge, the only valid Amiga'S file name it cannot handle is "

Quarterback can use any two of the standard floppy drives, DFO-DP3, for backup, but uses only one drive for the restore operation.

Guarterback has no provision for setting the archive bit during a restore operation. The archive bit is set immediately after the file is read (if the user so desires! If, however, the user does a full backup followed by reformatting the hard drive and a restore, the restored files do not have their archive bits set In spite of these shortcomings, I can highly

recommend Quarterback

EDITOR'S NOTE: Quarterback is the program used to maintain a backup of the MCCC BBS system. It works flawlessly. The latest release of the program allows restores from multiple floppies and also allows backup and restores from devices other than floppies.

## The Final Cartridge III

## A Hardware Review by Norm Minshall Reprinted from Semaphore

Sitting in your favorite chair you have just picked magazine and while glancing through the ads you see up the most recent issue of your favorite computer an ad for - "THE ULTIMATE UTILITY"

Your breath quickens and you realize that for the patry sum listed you can have "IT", the best selling utility of its kind, Does the above setting sound familiar to any of you?

All functions of the FC-I are "pulldown" window generated and icon controlled by using a joystick plugged into port f2 This means that you could open a window under the utilities section and do a directory on drive 8 or 9; run, validate or scratch files of you choice; fast format a disk; rename or change your disk ID. or even reorder the directory with no effect on your system at all

While the above may sound a bit campy to some of you, I seriously think that IT" found me When I received the new FINAL CARTRIDGE II in the mail for the sum of $5495 plus freight, I ripped open the package with great expectations. Plugging the FC-I into my Cl2i produced instant 64 mode. Displayed at the top of the screen was a choice of five different items. With only modest trepidation, I selected the on screen clock function setting it to the correct time with the alarm to go off two hours later.

The first section of the Final Cartridge Ill is called the DESKTOP and contains the entry points into all modes of operation. All operations are available at power up including a X15 LOAD SPEED TURBO and an X7 SAVE TURBO. My daydreaming days during saves and loads are over.

In the basic preference section you can enable the C128 keypad (if you have one), select default system colors and even choose your default save or load device.

When you use the FINAL CARTRIDGE I to select Centronics or Rs232 with the ability to print in seven your print options, you can configure it to Commodore, different modes from single density to CRT graphics I! You even have an option to print sideways!

The basic section of the many screen extends Commodore basic and adds 30 new commands for your use. Cl28 features are now available such as "DLOAD" from C64 mode. Scratched a file you shouldn't have recently? No problem - using the "RECOVER" feature of this cartridge.

Of course we could talk all day about the "FREEZER SECTION" of the FINAL CÁRTRIDGE IL activate the sprite to sprite kill or the sprite to

For those of you who are programmers, there is an excellent machine language monitor included as well as a disk pack/unpack feature similar to the "ZIP" utilities available now.

How many times have you played a multi-level game and could not get past level 9 of the 32 levels available? You know someone made it because you can see their initials in the hi-score area. Again, in the famous words of ALE, "NO PROBLEM". Just background kill along with the joystick autofire option You cant loose. In fact you do not even have to change the joystick from port to port Just click on the "JOYSWAP" and away you go.

backed up is running. Sounds easy doesn't it? Believe me, it is.

The FINAL CARTRIDGE Ill will back up 99% of all memory resident programs while the program being

Other features include a soft reset button and a full disable of the cartridge through the "FINAL KIL" available just right for that quick letter you needed to command There is also an excellent notepad feature write.

The only problem that I did note was the lack of

By now you can tell that 1 REALLY like the features of this cartridge and can easily retire about eleven different utility disks that I used to use. The ease of operation along with its many features make the purchase of this cartridge and excellent choice Definitely an "IT" that is worth more than the purchase price

"MOUSE" support. It just goes to show that you can't bave everything.

## Warp Speed

## A Hardware Review by Dick Estel Reprinted from 64 U.M.

When Captain Kirk and Engineer Scott were roaming the galaxy, they could always count on the Warp Drive to act up just when the alien entity was at its most threatening.

On the other hand, when it worked, Warp Drive could get the

Warp Speed offers a substantial improvement over FastLoad in its disk utilities section - with directory based file

Starship Enterprise halfway to Rigel IV before you could say, ™m a doctor, not a computer programmer!"

The newest cartridge from Commodore 64 and 128, Warp Speed from Cinemaware, has some of the same mixed qualities - when it's good, it's like a dash through the star systems, and when it acts up you bave two copying like Fast Hack 'Em, a quick full disk copy feature, 15 second format and other convenient features. It supports the normal DOS Wedge commands for quick loading with the Commodore Run-Stop keys, file loading with / 0r %, quick directory view without disturbing the program in memory, etc. It permits changing to a second

drive by simply typing #9 (RETURN], And it comes with a reset switch and a toggle for C64 or C128.

Virtually all programs I use load without problems EXCEPT Pocket Writer and Pocket Planner (interestingly, Pocket Filer loaded Ok, but I haven't actually used it).

RUN magazine gave a very favorable review to the cartridge in their August issue - however, they did mention that Cinemaware President Bob Jacobs stated that the cartridge had a "top of memory" bug, Possibly this is the cause of the mismatch with Directory Assistance.

The most dismaying problem 1 encountered out there among the stars was when I loaded up Directory Assistance, a shareware utility that I use several times a week. It loaded fine and worked with most disks. However, when I tried to work on some disks that have a great many files (100 or more), I got an "out of memory" error, and could not use the program on those particular disks without unplugging the cartridge.

Overall, the product rates 9 on a scale of 10. I don't know if it's faster that FastLoad, but the file copier is much better and the simple drive change feature is handy for anyone with two drives.

## The Awesome Arcade Action Pack A Review by David Motowylak Reprinted from Amy Today

Being the arcade fanatic that 1 am, I just had to pick up Arcadia's latest release, entitled THE AWESOME ARCADE ACTION PACK VOLUME ONE After a long and tiresome workout, here's what I found.

The package contains three disks, each holding a separate action-packed game. Documentation comes in the form of a small black booklet, and while it contains some useful information, it is certainly not needed to enjoy the games. These are "arcade games" - they are meant to be easy to play and understand As the packaging reads, the games are "easy to pick up, impossible to put down."

XENON, the next disk, is *another* vertical scrolling shoot'em up. Here you have the option of switching between a ground based hovercraft and a fighter plane. Again, you pick up "power packs" to strengthen your craft, such as invulnerability, lasers, and speed The object still is to destroy the enemy defenses and make your way through the various levels. At the end of each sector you must face a large "sentinel" that has only one vulnerability. After finding its weak spot you move on to the next level I'm still puzzled why Arcadia chose to include two vertical scrolling games in their game pack. The games feel quite different, but the general objective is the same. I think for the sake of variety there would be a wider selection.

The first disk is SIDEWINDER, a vertical scrolling shootem up, similar to Xevious, Mission XXX, and a million others. The goal is to shoot your way through five levels of an alien spacecraft, destroying fuel tanks, buildings, and enemy fighters. Along the way you'll pick up various power packs" that make your spaceship temporarily more powerful (rapid fire and power shots are some). The graphics are very sharp and colorful, especially from level three onward. Play can get pretty hectic as the game progresses - I still haven't made it past level five yet. I'm dying to see what happens SIDEWINDER is definitely the best of the bunch, offering the best game play and graphics.

Finally, BLASTABALL, the third of the set, is described as a "Hi-tech" ice hockey from the far future. The setting is on a metal play arena, much like a hockey rink without the ice. You control one of ten craft, each with different abilities, trying to score more goals than your opponent. Goals are made by either booting "homing missiles" at a steel puck that cause it to move, or by pushing the puck with your craft. Guiding the puck into the opponents goal area scores points. Play continues for three minutes, or until one player scores nine points. A nice feature is that either one or two people can play - 1 found playing "head to head" the most fun. Overall, play is somewhat slow and the graphics are not quite up to por (for example, the fans are represented by large round circles). C'mon guys, this is an AMIGA! BLASTABALL is fun, but could use a lot of touching up,

Even at its suggested retail of $49.99, The Awesome Arcade Pack is a great buy. The games will definitely keep you busy for awhile, and while each game may not be perfectly polished, you'll still get great arcade action that will satisty anyone.

## StarGlider I

## A Review by Daryl Stewart Reprinted From The Amigo

Starglider Il is a continuation of StarGlider, but you need not have seen or played the origina. Startlider to enjoy SG. I SG. 1 is light years ahead of its predecessor and any other game on the shelves today. Your mission in Stardlider I, should you decide to accept it, is to single handedly take on the Egron Empire and to eventually destroy the Egron's Death Star" space station. The space station is capable of destroying the planets of your Home World's Solar system, I know some of you out there are saying, "Well, That doesn't sound too hard I'm &amp; Hard Core Gamer, who marathon plays a game till | finish it... twelve hours later. Ill have THIS game done in two days.. Tops" Well, I've got one thing to say to you. .. WRONG. StarGlider Il is a mix of great arcade graphics and game play with an adventure thrown in to boot I predict this game will stay active in your library for a very long time.

Startlider Il is split into three different sections. The first section is the regular course around the planet where you blast everything in sight Only you dont shoot everything - just most everything, some you look for objects you need. Its like a scayengers hunt with lasers. In the Planet Mode the ground i

The graphics on Startlider I are nothing short of fantastic. If you thought that F-18 Interceptor had nice graphics, well just wait till you see SG. II The game has over 100 different objects that you can come across in your visit to its electronic world. These objects range from an electronic whale, to a command chair, to casks of wine. The graphics flow very smoothly, and the animation of the objects is very realistic. The sound on the Amiga version is superb, from the firing of your weapons to the lightning like sound of your ship called the ICARUS getting hit The combination of Great Graphics, Fantastic animation and Superb sound all make for a great game.

things you need to capture with your tractor beam, so You cute te or step an other net thit. checkered, but just for those of you who hate the checkered look, you can turn it off at any time during the game. There is also a very nice shadow effect, which also can be turned off. You must re-fuel the Powerlines, that are a number of small towers linked bunch of Tesla Coils linked together. Refueling is

The Tunnel mode is next. If you find a tunnel entrance and destroy the lunnel guardian then you can enter into the tunnel system of that planet The tunnel system is a maze of steel cylinders with an occasional Y' section. This tends to make the tunnels all look the same, which in turn, makes it very easy to get lost in the tunnels. When in the tunnel system your objective is to find the many Service Depots. The Service Depots are where you trade for better weapons in exchange for items you captured earlier. The Depots are easy to see, most of all because they are all at dead ends. It might be a wise idea to make a map of the larger tunnel systems.

ICARUS on the planet. There are objects, called in a row by lines of electricity. It is much like a achieved by diving at these towers and skimming over the top of them, thus refueling the ICARUS.

Last, but nowhere near least, is the Space mode. The Space mode is where you travel between planets and or moons in your solar system. Once you have broken free of the planet's gravitational force the Icarus is in space If you think that being in space and warping to and from planets is safe, think again. Wouldn't you know it, there are pirates in space, and they want whatever you have - that includes your life! Keep a sharp eye out for stray asteroids and other things that can damage your ship. There are fourteen different planets and moons that you can visit and none of them are very friendly. Once you are in space you must activate the Icarus's StarDrive system and "warp" to the planet you are pointed at Be careful when entering the next world's atmosphere however. Enter it too fast and you might just burn up in re-entry.

StarGlider Il is loaded with neat features. You can line up your cross hairs on a distant object or planet

This is great for identifying an object that you can hear but not readily see. By Pressing the 5 key you get a status of where you are and how well you are doing, StarGlider II has the added feature of being able to save any number of games in progress. The ability to use the number pad to riew your ship from the outside and at different pre-set angles is also supported In addition to the number pad, you can use the arrow keys to give you any point of view that you wish This means that you can look 360 degrees in the X, Y, and 2 planes In addition to all of these neat features there is one more that Id like to go over. This is the fact that the ONE disk you get when you buy Startlider If is not only able to boot on an Amiga, but -get this-, CAN ALSO boot on an Atari ST. Dont ask me how they did that little slight-of-hand trick because I just don't know.

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

Those of you who didnt attend the December meeting missed a really good one. Gordon Zimmerman won the door prize: a brand new Intruder Alert value $160 - donated by Software Terminal Not coincidentally, our presentation was of the Intruder Alert, Scott Lamb is the author and Software Terminal is the publisher of this new product We were fortunate to have a presentation by both Scott and Richard Bilyea of Software Terminal Scott did most of the talking while Richard restrained himself and did his best at a Vanna White imitation - pointing and smiling - through most of the demo. Very entertaining, guys.

It can be used as a lot more than a security device It can monitor any activities in the home: How many times is your refrigerator door opened? How long is your front door open in the space of a day? Using the logging capabilities of the software, these statistics can be captured. If you have a business, the software could be used to welcome people entering and could even trigger a special slideshow or demonstration. The possibilities are endless. If you missed it, check it out.

Intruder Alert looks great The hardware portion plugs into the second joystick port and provides ports to control eight devices. Each port can be individually programmed, via the software provided, to trigger on either an open or closed line. On triggering, the software can play sound effects, use the Amiga speech capabilities, can phone you or someone else at a preset phone number, or active an AmigaDOS script to perform any series of things you like You can even phone home to see if all is OK. Very versatile.

And a special thanks, once again, to Software

Terminal for their support A $160 door prize is

See you at the meeting, January 19, at 7:30 in the Arlington Community Center.

pret is month, the presentation will be another entertaining and informative one Don't know yet what it will be, but it will be great. The new officers will be in place. A lot of old faces there but the big change will be to welcome back Jack Smith as Vice President after &amp; one year absence from an officer's slot. It will be nice to see Jack back again in an active role.

## Amiga By-The-Loop Brent Wood

Happy New Year! I hope that your wishes for software and hardware came true over the holidays. One of mine did I also hope that you remembered the club in your New Year's resolutions for 89.

Gary Campbell (Librarian)

In December we elected (appointed) new chapter officers. Four of the five positions were filled by:

Bruce Nelson (Treasurer)

David Owens (Vice President)

Brent Wood (President).

Aiso at the December meeting we had Scott Lamb from Software Terminal show us his newest creation in the Tele-Games series, Tele-Epic. This game allows you to do battle with a friend over the phone (with a modem) or head-to-bead in front of your computer. You are in command of 12 men armed with swords, knives and bow-and-arrows as you attempt to kill All of your opponents men. (Vent that aggression!) features are buit into the game that allow you to communicate with your foe as you try to decimate his forces. This game is on my wish list.

We hope to add a new person to this list to fill the Secretary's job very soon. The above officers will serve the chapter for the 1989 calendar year.

The new year brings us around to membership renewal time. Don't forget to renew your membership BEFORE it expires so that you don't miss any issues of the newsletter or meetings.

RENEW! RENEW! RENEW! RENEW RENEW!

(The Amiga By The Loop chapter has doubled in size in less than a year!

Our next meeting is January 10, 1989 at 7:30 in room 208 of the Richland Hills Church of Christ building just West of Loop 820 and Rufe Snow.

Christmas music in stereo greeted members as they arrived for the December meeting. Herschel Gibbs was using his SID sound chip. He also had a discount coupon available to members for a stereo cartridge called "The Stereolizer". Glen Herring welcomed Dorothy Gates as &amp; new member and distributed updated membership lists. A proposed slate of officers was presented and yoted on The new officers for 1989 are: Glen Herring, President; Brad Dumlar, Vice President; Janet Hamm, Treasurer; Eddie Allen, Secretary/Reporter; Blake Brown, Librarian; Jerry Hiatt, Assistant Librarian.

Filling in for Dick Headley who was ill, Harold Williams demonstrated the capabilities of CAD 30, a computer aided design utility now in our library. This is quite a versatile drawing program compared to other rather expensive CAD programs on the market It includes borizontal and vertical fanouts, grids, circles, bexagons, understands the RIE (run link encoder), and saves to disk. It's printing abilities are limited, but for the price (free), it's a program well worth trying out Also, Harold recommended that all program documentation be read into a word processor for better printouts. Thanks, Harold

Special featured program for January is "The Computer and Packet Radio*. Mike Heskett, ham operator WB5QLD, of Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES), will be presenting this very interesting and informative program. Come join us for this special evening - bring a friend All ham radio operators are welcome, too, See you Tuesday evening, January 17th, 630 P.M. at the Arlington Community Center.
