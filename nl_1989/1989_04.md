## Upcoming Special Events in the Metroplex Ned Kelly

## AmiFORUM

AmiFORUM is coming to town. Just what is an AmiFORUM you ask? Well, it is a smaller version of an AmiEXPO which any red blooded Amiga owner has certainly heard about. You won't want to miss it! There will be software and hardware developers from all around the country. This is your chance to meet and talk to all of those people you have only heard and read about.

In addition to all of the developer's booths, the MCCC will have its own booth at AmiFORUM. We will be selling blank disks, club disks, taking membership applications, and advertising our fall event, METCOM*89. To do this we need volunteers to man this booth. If you plan on attending and can spare an hour or two please contact our booth coordinator, Brent Wood, at 817-246-3707. Please direct any other questions regarding this event to Ned Kelly at 817-277-5825.

AmiFORUM will take place on Saturday and Sunday, May 6 and 7, at the DFW Hilton and Executive Conference Center which is located just north of the D/FW airport. The hours will be 10 AM to 6 PM on Saturday and 12 PM to 6 PM on Sunday. Admission at the door is $10 for one day or $15 for two days. However, by registering early through the MCCC you can get a 20% discount making it $8 for one day or $12 for two days (see the registration form elsewhere in this newsletter).

## MCCC Spring Event

The Mid-Cities Commodore Club will hold its Spring Event this year on Saturday, April 22, 1989 at the Brookside Recreation Center in Hurst, from 1:00 PM until about 5:00 PM. We will have a full afternoon devoted to desktop publishing. This is your opportunity to get questions answered and to see and compare several software alternatives side by side. At present the agenda is as follows:

## PageStream

## An Amiga Software Review by Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

PageStream is the most powerful desktop publishing program currently available for the Amiga. Its power lies in its ability to produce output on an i capable sin the honest slude that publishing programs (Shakespeare, City Desk, Pagesetter, Professional Page, etc.), used a bit-mapping method to create printer output. I'll use Pagesetter as my example since that is the program I used to produce the newsletter until now and it is, therefore, the program I am most familiar with. All of the others work essentially the same.

Hence PageStream. PageStream operates in much the same way as does a Postscript desktop publishing program and a Postscript device. Fonts, text, and graphic objects are stored not as bit-mapped images, but as a series of vectors. When the document is printed, those vectors are translated into a bit-mapped image which is then sent to the printer. The big difference is that the translation takes place in the computer - not in the output device. This means that ANY printer can now operate at its full resolution. A 9-pin impact printer can suddenly produce an image which is 1,920 by 2,160 for that 8 by 10 inch print size - quite a step up from the 960 by 720 which was possible before.

I will use a standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch page as an example with a corresponding print area of 8 by 10 inches. Pagesetter displays this page on the screen using a bit-mapped image which is 1,020 pixels across and 792 pixels high. This corresponds to the standard, 9 pin printer output of 120 dots per inch horizontal resolution by 72 dots per inch vertical resolution. Pagesetter displays this image on a standard 640 by 200 pixel screen and allows you to scroll to different areas of the page using standard Amiga gadgets. When the page is printed, what happens, in essence, is a screen dump. A bit-mapped pattern of dots, 960 by 720 for that 8 by 10 inch print image, is sent to the printer. It is an exact copy of the image that appeared on the screen. The problem with this method is that most printers are capable of a much higher resolution. standard 9-pin impact printers are capable of a 240 by 216 resolution. Other printers are capable of even higher resolutions. You can select a higher print density via Preferences, but the result is simply more dots per inch - not higher resolution. If, for example, you were to select a density of 6 in Preferences (representing 240 by 216 resolution on a 9-pin printer), each horizontal pixel will, in effect, be printed twice and each vertical pixel will be printed three times. The dots are closer together, but the image is no clearer than before.

line drawn from point A to point B. A page can be described to a Postscript device as a series of vectors. The Postscript device can then calculate the dots which are necessary to represent those vectors and then print that page using the full resolution of the device (usually 300 by 300 dots per inch, but sometimes greater). This is the way that a high-end Postscript laser printer operates. The catch is, Postscript devices are expensive since they must contain ROM chips capable of deciphering the Postscript commands sent to them as well as large amounts of RAM for storing the Postscript commands, for performing the necessary calculations, and for storing the resulting bit-mapped image. When printing to a non-Postscript device, the printed output from Professional Page is not even as good as that from Pagesetter.

Other programs, Professional Page for example, will optionally provide output to a Postscript device. Postscript is a language which provides a series of commands to a Postscript device describing objects in terms of vectors. A vector, in simple terms, is a

Actually, PageStream will allow you to produce output in any possible resolution supported by your printer. This is a really nice feature. The DeskJet used to produce this newsletter, for instance, is capable of 75, 100, 150, and 300 dot per inch (DPI) resolutions measured in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The final print is, of course, produced using the highest resolution, but the 150 DPI is just fine for seeing if the layout on the page is right. This saves a great deal of time and ink.

PageStream will also produce Postscript output if desired.

Now for a brief rundown on the features - other than printing - that PageStream offers. I will note

any bugs or omissions that I have run across as I go in order to keep this as short as possible.

## Display

You have the option of displaying Grids, Guides, Rulers, or Tabs. All of these features may be set to your own preferences. There are a couple of problems with regard to the Ruler option. The ruler displays a dotted line on both the X and Y axis representing the current cursor position. This dotted line is fixed on the ruler each time you press the mouse button and the ruler soon becomes so cluttered that it is impossible to tell your position at all. The second problem relates to the zoom feature which I have yet to mention. At any variable zoom setting, the ruler is not accurate and becomes totally useless.

Column outlines can be turned on or off (they won't print in either case). Pictures may likewise be turned on or off. In the case of pictures, they always print but the screen updates are much faster if they are not shown.

You have the the page in any two facing layout) to close for У о и n option of displaying number of ways from pages (good for checking variable zoom (for getting up detail work). Another bug: if accidentally zoom in on too small area, the menus will disappear. But don't panic. All the menus have keyboard equivalents. Use them to zoom back out, then save your document using the keyboard equivalents and your menus will return.

## Document Handling

A page can be defined as either portrait or landscape format. Portrait format is the normal page layout used for a letter or for this newsletter: The text goes across the 8 1/2 inch dimension. In a landscape document, the text would go across the 11

A PageStream document can be any number of pages that memory will allow. Pages may be any size with the following limitations: The minimum dimension is 1 inch and the maximum dimension is 18 inches. This makes business cards, posters, and index cards all easily defined. (When printing a larger than paper sized document, the Tiling print option will split your page into sections which can then be taped together for a poster.)

Up to six documents may be open at a time (memory permitting) which allows cutting and pasting between them.

PageStream, by default, uses a 640 by 400 interlaced, two bit-plane display. You may choose 640 by 200 and any number of bit-planes you desire that the Amiga supports. This is not a WYSIWYG desktop publisher. The output that you will be getting on the printer far surpasses the Amiga's ability to display it. PageStream handles this by providing separate fonts for display, print, and Postscript (and, by the way, standard Amiga fonts are not supported). What you see on the screen will be an accurate representation of the printed document in terms of layout, but the fonts will only inch dimension. be a rough approximation of the final results.

You may set up standard pages (as I do for things such as the list of club officers and the back page layout) and then APPEND those pages to the document you are working on.

PageStream provide a "Master Page" option. On a "Master Page" which is provided as a part of each document, you may optionally define a standard set of features which will then appear on every page of your document automatically or you may define a right and left "Master Page" whose features will appear on alternate pages. The header that you

You may insert, delete, or move individual pages within a document. No option is provided to save a page - a needed improvement.

see on the top of this page is produced from the document's "Master Pages" This saves the work of producing it over and over again and ensures that each page is identical. Page numbering, if desired, is automatic. The "Master Page" features may be turned off for any page.

## File Handling

Graphic files may also be imported. These may be standard bit-mapped IFF pictures in any resolutionted dravil arom or the Draw y us

You may import text from either a standard ASCI file or from a Word Perfect file. If a Word Perfect file is imported, all the document formatting and text styles will be imported along with the text.

When an IFF image is imported, it may be taken into a separate window from which a portion may be clipped for inclusion in the document.

Menu selections are also provided for export of either text or graphics. Neither works. In the case of the Graphic Export option, a message is provided saying that the feature is not currently available. In the case of the Text Export option, the system crashes - one of the two major bugs I found.

## Editing

Standard editing features are provided for manipulating text. You may cut, copy, paste, and delete. All features work well. Additionally, you may also cut, copy, paste, and delete entire objects or groups of objects. These can be either blocks of text or graphic objects.

The system also provides a comprehensive spell-check option with an expandable dictionary. Don't use it 'till it's fixed. This was my second major crash.

A very powerful string Search feature is provided with pattern matching capabilities. A Replace option is available as well. PageStream could almost be used as a word processor if necessary but I would not recommend it due to the rough screen characteristics and the slow update when inserting or deleting text.

## Text Handling

A unique feature that PageStream offers is the use of Tags. A Tag is a way of defining a set of text attributes by name. For instance, the text of this article will have a certain setting for font, size, justification, line spacing, indents, fill style, text style, etc.. These can all be tied to a Tag and then

Text fonts, sizes, and styles may all be changed at any point in a block of text. There are ten fonts provided with the program - others are available both commercially and in the public domain. Sizes are infinitely adjustable and may be separately adjusted with regard to width and height. Styles supported include backslant, bold, underline, double underline, italicize, light, mino, outline, reverse, shadow, strike through and big qoMu . They may be used separately or in any combination. The only room for improvement is in the outline and shadow options where there is no provision for varying the width of the line used for the outline. Superscript and subscript are also provided.

that tag can be associated with a particular block or position in a block of text. It has the advantage of setting all variables at once. It also has the advantage of providing a simple way of changing a bunch of things at once. If you want to change fonts, just change the Tag - all text associated with this Tag will be automatically changed.

## Drawing Tools

PageStream provides a multitude of tools for drawing objects on a page. You may draw boxes, boxes with round corners (the radius of the corners is adjustable), vertical and horizontal lines, lines in any direction, circles, ovals, arcs, elliptical arcs, polygons, or free-form lines. A block of text is one more object which, after creation, may be manipulated in the same way as any of these other objects. All objects are stored as "object oriented" images. In this way, they may be resized either individually or in groups with no loss in resolution. Any object may have an associated fill pattern or line pattern/width. There are 40 pre-defined fill patterns. Any of these may be re-designed using an internal editor. One program bug seems to be the inability to redefine any but the first fill pattern. There are seven built in line styles which likewise can be redefined, eight line widths, and three line terminators: a straight end, a rounded end, and an arrow. A different terminator can be used on each end of a line.

Any of these objects, including blocks of text, may be rotated, slanted, and/or twisted. Automatic text runaround may be turned on for any object even a text object - and runaround may be in any direction. Objects may be automatically aligned with each other or in relation to the page in either the x ory directions. Finally, any object may be cloned.

## Summary

This is not all, but if this newsletter is going to contain anything other than this review, I must stop now. Most of you are probably asleep by now anyway. I haven't mentioned global settings, macro definition and use, support for color, automatic hyphenation, custom kerning definition, support for special characters like these &amp; · ™ ®1, and lots of other stuff that I'm forgetting about. Sound overpowering? It's really not. Like most things, you learn the basics and then use the other stuff when and if you need it.

This is a new and very powerful program. Like anything new and powerful, there are some problems and I have tried to point them out as I went along. The March MCCC News was produced with just two system crashes. Once I learned not to spell check or export text, PageStream and I got along just fine. I have no doubt that those problems will soon · wken cre or mo endo come o. 1 my aesires wi be incorporated as well.

My recommendation? BUY IT! Software this good deserves all the support we can give it. It makes the Amiga a full-fledged desktop publishing machine for the first time and sets standards which will be difficult for the competition to match. Anyone care to try?

## geoPublish C64 Software Review by Dick Estel

## Reprinted from the Fresno Commodore Users Group (64UM)

Like the search for the Holy Grail, the quest for a really good desktop publishing program for the C64 is frustrating and possibly doomed to ultimate failure. To the best of my knowledge, there are only two entries even worthy of consideration in the DTP race: Paperclip Publisher and geoPublish.

I am assuming most C64 users have an acquaintance with GEOS, and will not explain basic GEOS terminology such as the desk top or photo scraps in this review. (I will answer any individual questions by phone or at a meeting.)

Both of these offer a lot of features for a low price, especially in comparison to what you would pay for MS-DOS or Amiga programs. Considering the limits of 8 bits and 64 or 128K, the wonder is not that these programs have serious limitations, but that they exist at all.

In this review I will make some references to how the program works with the 1764 Ram Expansion Unit. In future issues I will present a complete review of GEOS 2.0 and the REU, as well as some other GEOS applications.

All of GEOS' major applications use up a great deal of memory. The basic geoPub program itself uses 99K. Since it must be on the same disk (RAM or floppy with the fonts and other accessories, you

Use of the REU creates nothing more than a 165K "pseudo-disk". ', the same size as a floppy. However, GEOS applications frequently access the disk drive, resulting in delays as information is swapped in and out of computer RAM. With the REU, the speed of this access is very noticeably increased.

reach capacity very quickly.

Although the program supports documents up to 16 pages, you would need to have very sparse pages indeed to fit that many on one disk!

on the REU so it is always in RAM. Then I don't need floppy disk access until I quit the program.

Actual work on a document involves four "modes" '. In "master page layout" · you can insert graphics, draw lines, circles and other shapes, and enter text directly (intended for short text items, such as headlines). A wide variety of changes can be made in the appearance of graphics created within this mode, such as choosing varying line thickness or using different patterns for shapes, lines and text. Any GEOS font on the disk can be used, and the size can be varied in one-point increments from 4 to 192 (a little over 2 1/2 inches). The master page layout can be saved into a "library", but bitmap graphics on the layout will not be included. Anything entered in master page layout will appear on all pages of that document.

"Page graphics mode" works exactly the same as master layout, and is intended for entering the graphics and headings that will be different on each page. In both these modes, a bitmap graphic can be imported, but it must first be on the disk with the program in the form of a photo scrap. The scrap can be removed from the disk after it is pasted into the document.

"Page layout mode" permits the importing of text files or graphics into regions that are defined with a "click &amp; point" tool similar to drawing a rectangle in geoPaint or a box in PC Pub. In this mode, a graphic can be reduced or expanded to fit the defined space and can be smoothed. Once they are imported into the document file, text files must remain on the

![Image](1989_04_artifacts/image_000002_37e0131e78b9814c2e8467faccf2d2369106bfa40ddfb239dbb638e784bf8dea.png)

One recommendation is to keep the document file on the real disk and the program on the REU. The text files must be on the document disk, but everything else can be separate (everything else must be on the same disk with the main program, however). I find that this still results in a great deal of access to the real disk. My preference is to put everything I use document disk. There is an edit mode, essentially a stripped-down geo Write, in which changes can be made, fonts and styles selected, and text justified.

Page layout has an automatic ¡linking feature. Documents can be continued to another page or column simply by clicking on the new region and opening the document from a menu. The text will automatically start where it left off in the previous region. The text can be flowed around regions that are created within page layout mode.

Although graphics must be in geoPaint photo scrap format, they can be converted from Print Shop, Printmaster or Newsroom with the Graphics Grabber. This utility does not come with geoPublish, but is available in the Deskpack Plus, which now sells for as little as $18 by mail order. There are also some public domain programs that do some of these conversions but I have not tried them.

The program does come with the Text Grabber which converts a number of word processor formats to geo Write. There are also master page and page layout libraries with suggested layouts for various purposes; and a complete tutorial, which I ignored. I belong to the "suffer and learn by doing" school!

Like PaperClip Publisher, geoPublish rewards careful planning and punishes those who like to poke around at the keyboard and see what they come up with. (I have learned to accept this punishment quietly!)

So - how does it work? Anywhere from so-so to great, depending on what aspect of the program you are discussing.

Because of the program's memory requirements, I usually must limit a given file to one or two pages. The need to load files from a floppy to the REU and save them back again takes away from the speed I had hoped to gain with it. However, once this is done, the operation is speeded up dramatically. There is a lot of re-drawing of the screen when switching from one mode to another and to and from zoom mode, which is tediously slow when the program is on a floppy.

The capability of moving and resizing regions is very quick and easy to use. The resizing of bitmap graphics is a little less satisfying. In Paperclip Publisher, this process takes more time but is more convenient and gives slightly better results. Changing the pattern and line thickness of graphics or the size, style or font of text is also fast and simple. Another plus is the ability to use drawing tools (lines, rectangles, etc.) within the document, a feature that PC Pub lacks.

The most difficult aspect of the program is in moving or resizing text regions. Page layout mode does not allow a zoom feature, so I must switch to page graphics to zoom in. If the text is slightly off center or the wrong size, I must switch back to page layout to change it. Page graphics creations are not displayed in page layout mode, so these changes are done "blind" . There is a ratchet feature which permits a crude sort of measurement when moving regions. This option causes the pointer to move in jumps" which can be set to either two pixels or 1/2 inch.

The other serious lack, something PC Pub does offer, is the ability to move something from one page to another.

Using this program with other than an 80 dot-per-inch printer requires a little experimenting to find out where to set the right margin. However, once this is done, it does not change, so this was not a problem.

The conversion of files from the Write Stuff worked perfectly, and the placement and editing of text is far faster, easier and offers more features than Paperclip.

I encountered one hilarious bug in the program. If you type the word DATE in capital letters in master page mode, the program inserts the actual date instead of the word. Imagine my puzzlement at first when the headline "OFFICER CANDIDATES NAMED" printed out as "OFFICER CANDINOVEMBER 3, 1988S NAMED". I guess the wizards of Berkeley were asleep when they tested that feature!

In an overall evaluation, geoPublish is superior to Paperclip for two reasons. It makes use of the REU, significantly speeding up program operation, and its printer drivers produce a much better looking output.

I would say that a person with only one disk drive would have a hard time creating anything but the simplest documents. A BSW rep., writing in another newsletter, suggested ways to work around the limitations by moving files on and off the work disk as needed. Considering the agonizingly slow process involved in one-drive file copying with GEOS,. only the very calm, relaxed person should undertake this!

The more I work with geoPublish, the more I find ways to create interesting effects. I think it provides a very acceptable finished product, and is a worthy addition to the Commodore program base.

## C64 Library Report Harold Williams

I have prepared two new disks for the C-64 library for this month. The first disk is a collection of a dozen spectacular graphic/music demos. These programs include some of the most amazing graphic displays you will ever see on your 64. The music is also outstanding. This disk will provide hours of entertainment and is great for showing off the 64's capabilities. I've built in a menu to simplify the selection of the demo programs and I've included VDOS to speed up load time. Execute the menu with VDOS using the command LOAD "!*MENU",8,1. After the program loads enter the RUN command. If you do not wish to use VDOS simply LOAD and RUN "MENU"

The second disk for April includes Mark Dickenson's DIGI-PLAYER and several digitized sounds. DIGI-PLAYER plays sounds that were digitized on the Amiga and other computers. The results are unbelievable. DIGI-PLAYER comes with instructions on the disk.

## The Hewlett-Packard DeskJet Printer A Hardware Review by Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

The DeskJet is a dot matrix printer which uses an ink-jet process to get the dots on the paper. In other words, it squirts tiny dots of ink at the page - 300 to the inch, to be exact, or 90,000 dots to the square inch. This is the same dot resolution used by most laser printers. The only way to distinguish the output of the DeskJet from the output of a laser printer by sight is to look for the tell-tale wrinkling of the paper on a graphic dump caused by the wet ink.

The DeskJet uses cut sheet paper. Almost any paper will do. For my everyday text output I use cheap copy paper. For letters and such, I use stationary. For graphics, only high quality, 100% cotton fiber produces acceptable results - anything cheaper absorbs too much ink and you end up with a black mess - the cheaper the paper, the worse the mess. The paper is placed into a tray which will hold up to 100 sheets. Paper is fed and ejected automatically. If the tray runs out of paper in the middle of a print job, the printer will pause and a light will blink until you refill the tray and press the ONLINE button. It is very easy to change from one kind of paper to another with this arrangement.

The DeskJet is quiet. For those of us who are used to the pounding of an impact printer, it is a welcome relief. Listening to music or talking on the phone is not a problem, even when sitting next to it as it prints your document or picture.

Standard 9 1/2 inch envelopes may be fed singly though a special feeder. This allows you to print an envelope that look as good as the letter inside of it looks. The mechanism works well, allowing you to print even return addresses without smearing - a feat no impact printer that I have had experience with has been able to master.

The DeskJet uses only 20 watts of power when printing - 5 watts when idle. You don't have to worry about overloading any circuits with this one.

According to Hewlett-Packard, an ink cartridge will last for 250 pages of letter quality output. This, of course, can serve only as a rough guide. As I write this article, I am currently on my second ink cartridge and will probably start a third before this newsletter is finished. I have gone through close to 400 sheets of paper including o the nice icadures o he prind sat the ink ye, are integrated into the ink cartridge. When you replace the cartridge, the jets are replaced at the same time. This avoids the problem of clogged jets that has plagued some ink jet printers in the past.

## TEXT OUTPUT

The built in font is Courier. It is a fixed width font. You have the option of printing at 10, 16.67, or 20 characters per inch. You may also select either draft or letter-quality output in any of those sizes. All of the above options are panel or software controlled. You may also print double-wide (5 characters per inch) but that option is suftware controlled only.

It is also possible to download fonts to the DeskJet which can then be used just as the internal courier font is used. To do this you must first purchase a RAM expansion cartridge. A 128K cartridge runs about $100. The printer will support up to two cartridges. (Alternatively, you can buy additional fonts as cartridges and avoid the download step.) I purchased one cartridge and the Times-Roman / Helvetica downloadable fonts. These are both proportional fonts in 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 point sizes. When used with Word Perfect, the output possible with the printer and these fonts is indistinguishable from that produced by a professional typesetter. And the speed is still 120 characters per second (or at least as fast as Word Perfect prints). Simply remarkable. Ask me sometime and I'll show you some samples.

The printer is fast. In draft mode, the rated speed is 240 character per second - in letter quality mode the speed is 120 characters per second. The rated speeds are somewhat misleading however because of the time taken by the sheet feeding mechanism. In a timing test 1 ran, the DeskJet fed, printed, and ejected a page of letter quality output in 40 seconds. The same page took 30 seconds for draft quality. By the way, letter quality is really letter quality. The output is indistinguishable from a typewriter or daisy wheel printer. In draft mode, the printer automatically reduces its normal 300 by 300 dot per inch matrix to just 150 vertical dots. The result is a lighter print, being more gray in color rather than the normal jet black, but otherwise retaining the high quality print of the letter quality.

## GRAPHICS

The printer has four possible graphic resolutions. All

four are supported by Amiga's print driver and are selectable via Preferences. You may choose from 75, 100, 150, or 300 dots per inch. At 300 dots per inch and a good quality paper, the results are close to photographic quality. Some of the other resolutions can be used to give a preview of what the final print will be like. Lower resolutions save both time and ink. I did a comparison of the time it takes to print a graphic dump using the various resolutions available. 75 DPI produced a full page in 1.5 minutes, 100 DPI took 2 minutes, 150 DPI took 3 minutes, and 300 DPI took 9 minutes. Not too bad considering that on a full page at 300 dots per inch there are 7,200,000 dots!

I do have one complaint regarding graphic output on this printer. Pictures tend to come out much too dark. This is improved by using a high quality paper and by setting Preferences to the lightest setting but it still remains too dark. This is probably a problem with the print driver rather than with the printer and, I am sure, will be corrected in time.

## PROBLEMS

Just one. Don't let your printed pages get wet. The ink used in the DeskJet remains soluble. If you get caught in the rain or if you spill something on a page, the ink will run. This is not normally a big problem, but it is certainly a consideration.

## SUMMARY

If you want or need the best possible output, don't need color, and don't have the money for a laser printer, this is the printer for you. Even if you do have money for a laser printer, this is probably the printer for you - use what you save to buy something else. Price? The best price I could

April 15, (3) the MCCC April Spring Event at the Brookside Recreation Center on April 22, and (4) the Ami-Forum to be held at the DFW

Hilton Inn &amp; Convention Center on May 6 &amp; 7. Details for these events will be available as you read this column. Volunteers are needed for our April Spring Event and the Ami-Forum in May. The MCCC event will feature desktop publishing on the C64, C128 and Amiga. The Ami-Forum should bring together many developers, authors, manufacturers and dealers. It will be a good opportunity for us to get out the word about MCCC and increase our membership! Your help is needed in staffing our booth. Can you spare thirty minutes to an hour of your time? User group discounts will also be available to us.

Richard Bilyea of the Software Terminal and programmer Scott Lamb demonstrated their new Intruder Alert system. With your ingenuity being the only limit, this program can function as a home or business alarm. (Your Amiga just sets idle at night or when you're gone anyway, right?) You can set it up in a variety of applications: Use it for monitoring traffic at the front door or refrigerator. The logging includes a date and time stamp. If you have young children, you can remotely monitor their movement in the house, too. Completely multi-tasking and easy to install. Thanks again to it was rather hastily put together while we watched so perhaps that was to be expected. Thanks again to Intercomputing for the loan of this one, too.

Near the end of our meeting, a name was drawn for a box of disks and Jeff Nemec went home contemplating new uses for them. Be sure to put your name in the door

The last product of the night was Software Terminal's Intruder Alert. We were treated to a full demonstration of this product last year, but it was good to take another look. It provides a link to the outside world and can monitor and record activity from any sensor you hook up

to it. It's on my wish-list. Thanks to Software Terminal for the loan of this one and to Scott Lamb for the interesting talk.

Our new prize box at our next meeting on Tuesday, April 11 at 7:30 PM. Same place - North Richland Hills Church of Christ.

March's meeting featured hardware. We were shown three products - two of which most of us had never seen before. First, we were shown Pro-Draw. Pro-Draw is a drawing tablet designed to be used in place of the mouse with programs such as Deluxe Paint Il or Aegis Draw Plus. It provides a flat working area (12 X 12 for the model we were shown) and operates with either a stylus or a mouse-like object. It provides a much more natural interface than the mouse for drawing. Our thanks to Intercomputing for the loan.

The second product was Expansion Technologies' Toolbox. The Toolbox is an expansion unit designed to be attached to the Amiga 500. It contains two slots which can hold any card designed for the Amiga 2000. It provides its own power supply, and a pass-through for hooking up other expansion devices. Unfortunately, it didn't work in the demonstration, but shareware donation jar made its debut at the meeting. The idea is to support shareware authors as a club. I expect that our donations will exceed those requested by the author and donating in this way does not remove your personal obligation to donate if you use the product. It is simply recognition of the fact that most people do not contribute. I am embarrassed to say that donations from our chapter were non-existant. Are we going to let Amiga By-The-Loop carry us? They did their part. We're only talking about a dollar a month.

## Arlington/Grand Prairie Eddie Allen

The workshop in Grand Prairie was held in the library's auditorium again. There was a low turn out, but those present were a lively bunch. Due to conflicting scheduling, there will not be a workshop held in April. We will return to normal in May, so get together anything held in abeyance and bring it for everyone's adjudication.

The main meeting in Arlington was finally treated to Glen Herring's presentation of the Quick Brown Box cartridge. Both the 64 and 128 modes were demonstrated. This cartridge presents to the user a friendly way to keep several programs in battery preserved storage (survives turning off of the computer) which allows almost instantaneous retrieval for execution purposes. Brad Dumler showed how an upgrade to the Write Stuff' word processor allows the QBB to be used by a commercial product for productivity purposes. Glen concentrated on the 'your favorite utilities' aspect. The QBB

people also supply several useful utilities with the product.

All the programs are either from our club library or from local dealers at reasonable prices. They are:

Our March meeting centered around a demonstration and discussion of several ways to improve the speed and ease of use of Commodore's disk drives. We compared JiffyDOS, Warp Speed, and Super-Snapshot 64. We had a demo on how to use partitions on the 1581 3 1/2 inch drive and also looked

simulation games are of wide interest. Therefore the April meeting will allow you to bring your favorite simulation (Air, Land, or Sea) and share any expertise you have obtained. So bring your favorite program (and computer equipment) to the April meeting. See you there.

## Fort Worth Ellen Triplett

Saturday, March 11, found most of us doing what we thoroughly enjoy meeting with our fellow computer lovers and exchanging ideas and having fun. A report on the Board of Directors' meeting was given by John Sookma. We will have our normal April meeting of this chapter in addition to the April 22nd Spring Meeting of the whole club at Brookside.

The main body of our program was given by Julia Sookma, a teacher in special education for Kindergarten thru Sth grade. While other brands of computers are provided in her school for the teachers' use, she prefers to use her C64 with her classes. She finds the available programs more versatile and interesting, both to her and her students. One of the educational programs she uses on a

For Writing:

These programs are actually learning games which makes for no ubjections from the children, and would be ideal for home use for your own youngsters.

Mary Louise Hagemeyer reminded us that there are still those among us, and more coming in, who are somewhat new to computing, and gave us a Basic Discussion on Sequential Files. She demonstrated 3 simple programs to create them, read them, and update them. Ellen Triplett reviewed Disk #421 STARTER (helpful for the beginner).

Another member (forgive me, can't remember who) told us of free classes in Geos at Budget Computers - New York at Park Row in Arlington. Classes are limited and must be signed up for in advance.

Joe Ostrokul, our chapter librarian, provided us with the numbers of 2 disks containing Print Shop Art to supplement our programs - #274 and 277.

Next month's program will be a demonstration and discussion of the XI0 Powerhouse computerized home lighting and appliance control. Also another session of 20 Questions, and a review of another library disk. Pleas join us and bring your visitors.

at a few options to back up and auto load programs.

current ROM chips in your computer and disk drive. Eldor Luedtke, Jr. brought his 128 and demonstrated what a tremendous improvement it makes. With JiffyDOS a 113 block program loaded in just 10 seconds. The unaided load was 1:13 !! JiffyDOS also seems to handle loading copy protected software better than Warp Speed or Super-Snapshot 64.

As you probably all know by now, JiffyDOS is a ROM upgrade that replaces one of the

Eldor also demonstrated how Super-Snapshot 64 can freeze most programs in memory and them allow you to save the program to disk. The programs saved as a simple one file program regardless of how many files the original program loaded. It's a great way to back up your valuable disks and also to condense several programs to only one disk. It can also help save wear on your disk drive since it eliminates the complicated load routines most copy protection schemes use.

We wrapped up the meeting with a discussion on how to use partitions with the 1581 disk drive. And Eldor also pointed out several programs in our library which will auto load another program or provide a menu. All in all I think most everyone gained something or got a new idea on how they can better handle the disk drive. See ya next meeting...
