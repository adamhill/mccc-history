## Commodore's New 68020 Board An Amiga Hardware Review by Jack Smith Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Commodore Business Machines has begun shipping the first batch of the new Amiga 2500's and I have had the pleasure and honor of using one for a few days (courtesy of Peter Rafeiner and Intercomputing in Arlington Texas). To begin with, the 68020 was a truly painless upgrade. I removed the 68020 board from the 2500, opened my 2000 and removed 2 screws that cover the backplane access slot and plugged it right in to the 2000's CPU slot. Re-assembled the case, flipped the power on and presto - instant 14 MHz 68020 power! I was worried that my C= 8088 bridge board and my hardcard would not like having another CPU on the buss but I was pleased to find every thing worked as it had before. I didn't have to change a single thing in my startup-sequence with the 68020 installed. My system booted normally. You do have the option at boot time to hold down BOTH mouse buttons to bring up a screen that lets you select one of three configuration 68000, 68020 or Unix w/68020. The default is 68020 Amiga DOS but it's nice to have the option of down shifting to the 68000 for brain damaged software that can't handle the 68020. As of this writing the UNIX option was not available and selecting that button produced no effect.

to 400% and more. Ray tracing is notorious for it's long rendering times, but with the 68020 and Turbo Silver Version 3 or Sculpt 4D you can cut the processing time in half! To give you a feel for the overall speed increases you would see, try to imagine that every program on your system was suddenly coded in pure assembly language and now ran at least twice as fast as before.

Since the Amiga 2500 is in short supply at this time I am sure it's a seller's market and the dealers will be selling them for around $4600.00 with SCSI controller and 40 meg hard disk. For the thousands of existing Amiga 2000 owners I would guess the street price on the A2620 (68020 board with 68881 math chip, MMU and 2 meg of 32 bit RAM) will cost under $1500.00 vs. Commodore's suggested retail of $1995.00.

There are a few drawbacks to installing Commodore's 68020. First note that all 32 bit memory mounted on the 68020 board can not be accessed by the native 68000 on the Amiga's motherboard. So booting up in standard 68000 mode will access only memory installed via the Lorro slots. Maximum memory expansion on an Amiga with the 68020 would be 4 meg of 32 bit memory on the '020 card + 4 meg of 16 bit memory installed in a 100 pin Zorro slot + 1 meg of chip RAM for a total of 9 megabytes. (If you are using a PC Bridgeboard you will need to reduce the total 16 bit RAM by an additional 2 meg since that address space was reserved for the 8088 and 80286 interfaces).

The speed improvement was most impressive in CPU intensive operations, as might be expected, but it seemed that almost every operation was at least twice as fast. Those programs which directly support the 68020 and it's math co-processor can see improvements up

## The President's Quarters Jack Detore

Mid-Cities Commodore Club finished 1988 with a stronger club organization through the leadership of last year's President, Harold Williams. The tighter Texas economy had reduced our membership and raised expenses to the point where either dues would increase or got stronger. Our club is chartered as "not-for-profit" corporation, but we can't operate "for-loss" and expect to survive.

During this first quarter of 1989, your club officers have designated chapter members to help with the business of running the libraries, newsletter, and BBS, and have voted to purchase a new library disc drive and an ink-jet printer for the newsletter. (Some surplus equipment may be available for members to purchase ... call treasurer, Bob Krause).

The Club purpose is to: provide information about hardware/software related to Commodore computers, to provide forums for showing new users the benefits our group offers and get that message to those interested. We do that thru meetings of five chapters covering Amiga, Commodore 128 and 64 computers, a Club newsletter and a Club Bulletin Board System where E-mail and public domain programs can be exchanged. Our chapter libraries provide another way for members to build a useful set of public domain software efficiently.

Currently, MCCC is planning to have a club get-together in late April and to participate in the AmiForum that MIGHT be coming to the Metroplex during early May. The fall event, METCOM*89, is tentatively set for Oct 14th. Ned Kelly will be keeping us posted as arrangements are made. If you want to participate, let him know!

## Secretary's Notes February BOD Meeting

John Malmstrom

The MCCC Board of Directors held its regular meeting at North Richland Hills Recreation Center on February 11, 1989. This was one week later than the regularly scheduled 1st Saturday meeting. Remember the ice storm we had the weekend of the 4th? Anyway, here's what happened at the meeting...

The board approved a motion to emphasize the C-64/C-128 group of machines at the Spring special event to be held in April and to participate in an upcoming AMI-FORUM being planned for sometime in May in Dallas. If it comes off as planned we will have a booth at AMI-FORUM for the purpose of publicizing our club. We should be able to offset the cost of the booth through the sale of public domain software.

The board approved the purchase of two pieces of equipment. First, a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer to be used by the editor. Doesn't it make a big difference in the appearance of the newsletter? We also approved the purchase of a dual disk drive to be shared by the Amiga chapter librarians. Two excess 1571 disk drives will be transferred from the Arlington/Grand Prairie to the Fort Worth chapter. These moves should help speed things for the librarians.

President Jack Detore announced the appointment of Harold Williams as chairman of the Charter committee, and Vice-president Ned Kelly announced that his planning committee for the Spring event would consist of Richard Meyers, David Owens, Jon Moreland, and Brad Dumler.

## What's New At Babbage's C64/C128 Software Reviews by Cheryl Howard Mid-Cities Commodore Club

## (Software provided by Babbage's) ROGER RABBIT

For all those fans of Roger Rabbit, Buena Vista Software has released the computer version of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT with all the lovable characters of the movie. For those of you who didn't see the movie, I'll insert a plug here and recommend that you see it just as soon as the video cassette is released. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a cartoon (being an adult and all...) but the special effects and Disney know-how makes this is a movie to see for the kid in all. The computer version takes on the same mission as the movie, that is, find Marvin the Gag King's will and save Toontown from Judge Doom's "dip".

Next you come to the Ink and Paint Club where you must run around the tables picking up the papers as fast as the penguins place them on the tables. All this has to be done before the music stops. But watch out - if Roger gets dizzy, you are in big trouble. You loose a life and you only have five to use in the game. Use up all five and you must start over.

This joystick controlled game starts you off in Benny the Cab racing through Toontown against Judge Doom to the Gag Factory. You have to avoid puddles of Dip in the road by jumping up and driving on top of the buildings. The faster you complete the trip, the more of a lead you will have on the Judge.

When you finish at the Ink and Paint Club, you head for the Gag Factory and face the weasel henchmen of Judge Doom. Here you must use the gags you find to slow down the weasels while you search for the will. There is a Gag Catalog enclosed with the game to help you through.

This is a great game for young and old alike and well worth the $22.00.

## RACK 'EM

For amateur pool hustlers, Accolade has released RACK 'EM and the selling price is around $25. You can play 8-ball, 9-ball,

Straight pool, Standard 15 and Snooker. For those of you who have played Accolade's golf games, the action is the same. There are a variety of built-in trick shots, but you have the option to design your own. You can choose the object ball, the pocket, the aim, the amount of english and amount of power to place on each shot. You can even customize your own game and play by your own rules. Then you have the option to save your 10 best shots to a data disk. If you are not familiar with all the rules of pool, there is a nineteen page manual included in the package.

## SUPER PAC-MAN &amp; WHEEL OF FORTUNE

For those of you who still remember the Pac-Man programs of a few years back, Thunder Mountain Software has released SUPER PAC-MAN. I won't spend a lot of time reviewing this program as the method of play is the same as the original game. I just wanted to bring the program to your attention along with a mention that the second edition of WHEEL OF FORTUNE is also available with all new puzzles. Both of these games are in the $15 price range.

## TECHNO COP

Epyx has released TECHNO COP for the C-64/128 with a price of $33.95. This program will have you roaring down the asphalt driving an incredibly high-powered sports car called the V-Max. This car is reminiscent of KITT in the television show, Knight Rider of a few years back. You are part tough guy, part detective and very cunning as you track down and capture deadly and vicious criminals. There are eleven levels of play to this game, but since Miss Clumsy Klutz here couldn't get past the first level, you will just have to experience this one for yourself. From what I did see, I thought it would be very interesting for someone with more skill than I have.

Until next month..

## New Library Disks For the C64/C128

## Harold Williams

There will be four new disks placed in the C-64/128 library this month. The first disk is a terrific game called Super Rockfall. The game play is similar to the commercial game "Boulderdash" · Super Rockfall includes an editor to allow you to build new game screens. The music is absolutely fantastic.

The third disk is a collection of digitized Star Trek pictures. I've built in a special loader to allow this disk to run on either a C-64 or C-128 in 40 column mode. The C-64 loader offers a turbo load option. The C-128 version uses burst mode on a 1571 drive.

The second disk is an adventure game named Helltown. You begin the game in a jail cell lying on a cot. I've managed to take the cot apart and tie the sheets into a rope, but I can't get out of the cell. Some of you real adventure players, please help me out of this cell!

## Star Wars C64 Software Review by Eldor Ludetke Jr. Mid-Cities Commodore Club

Do you remember the Movie Star Wars? Do you remember the excitement of watching Luke Skywalker fighting hoards of the Empire's Tie fighters and make his run down the trench for the Death Star's only weakness, the exhaust port? Would you like to take the controls of Luke's X-wing fighter and take on the Empire yourself?

The fourth disk is a collection of about three dozen articles on CP/M for the C-128. These articles were downloaded from GEnie by Kenneth Bruen. I wrote a file reader/printer to include with these articles. These articles include topics that would be of interest to all C-128 users, not just those interested in CP/M. Ask your chapter librarian for these new disks at the March meetings

If you're like me the answer is yes and Broderbund Software has what you need: Star Wars for the C=64. That's right, they finally released it for the C=64 and it's not shabby. The game play is the same as the coin-op with three difficulty levels. If you choose Easy you will take on the Tie fighters in a deep space dog fight and then go on your run down the trench to drop a little something down the Death Star's only weakness, the exhaust vent. On the other two levels you also take on the Tie fighters, but when you finish them you must skim the surface of the Death Star and take on the deadly Laser Towers and avoid being hit by same. Once this is done you then run the trench. It's a little harder for you than the easy as it's full of things to crash in to.

For all of you who have the 1351 mouse, have you ever played an arcade game with it? You can with this one. I do and like it. It improved my game quite a bit over using the joystick but you can do OK using the joystick it you like. One more Thing: may the Force be with you.

## New Stuff I Just Got

## Amiga Software and Hardware Reviews By Bill Raecke Mid-Cities Commodore Club

There are two new products to report on. Problem is, l've been so busy becoming familiar enough with them to produce this newsletter that I had no time left to write a review. You are looking at the results. I think they speak for themselves.

The printer is wonderful: laser quality output (300 Dots per Inch) at a fraction of the cost. PageStream is also wonderful. It is not without its share of bugs, but it is powerful enough to put all other desktop publishing software to shame in spite of them.

The first product is the Hewlett-Packard Deskjet printer purchased by the MCCC for use in producing this newsletter. The second is PageStream, purchased by me for the same reason.

A full report will be included in next month's newsletter. For now, I will just show a few examples of the things that are possible.

## T.H.I.S.

## C128 Software Review by Ronnie Koshimizu SOCK

Micro Aided Designs has introduced T.H.I.S. (Technological Hybrid Integrated System), a user-friendly drawing program designed exclusively for the Commodore 128 personal computer. T.H.I.S. supports the 1700 and 1750 RAM. Although the RAM may add to the purchase cost, it allows you to perform many unique features with T.H.I.S. that are not found in other drawing programs. T.H.I.S. has four drafting pages, all with a capacity of 95.5% of the computer screen. This is possible thanks to drop-down menus. Selections are made with ease. The program provides real-time cutting, copying, pasting, and dragging, while actually seeing a portion of the screen being moved right before your eyes. Zoom in on the details with the Zoom feature. The zoom breaks the screen in two, allowing you to view both the enlarged area and the original area at the same time. Draw lines, boxes, circles, ellipses, and arcs in elastic modes, allowing you to do what other programs call rubber-banding. One unique feature is the Geometric Shapes menu which gives the user the ability to alter the characteristics of a circle or an ellipse. By using this option, the user can create multi-sides objects and alter the rotation of an object to a single degree.

As for the use of input devices, either the Commodore 1351 mouse or the Fexidraw light pen may be used. Cursor keys are used for fine tuning in all drawing modes and for menu selections. In addition to the Commodore 1571 disk drive, the 1541 and the new 1581 disk drive may be used. There is the option, after purchase, to exchange the 1571 disk for either a two disk set that allows

the use of the 1541 disk drive or a 3 1/2 inch disk for the 1581 disk drive. All disk functions are supported by T.H.I.S., and there may be as many as four disk drives accessed through the "Disk Window"

Program expansion is already in the works for those of you unable to get enough of T.H.I.S. New editions will expand the program up to four times its original size. The function key set is the doorway to linking T.H.I.S. net only to the new editions, but also the other graphics-related programs. There is access to a font generator, an animation program, and even the "Trade Show Caddy" . This is not a golf game. It is a combination of user-friendly software for displaying programs: the "Product Manager" ', the "Text Editor" ". and the "Graphics Editor"

T.H.I.S. is a drawing system capable of producing a simple doodle or a sophisticated blueprint. With T.H.I.S. you have a possible resolution of 960 by 536 dots per drawing page and seven totally separate pages to draw upon. Giving the user a larger area to draw on not only allows for larger sized drawings but also increases the amount of detail that can be added.

to be created and used in real life applications. The printout sizes can vary anywhere between 2 by 2 inches to 480 by 321 inches. T.H.I.S. is by Місто Aided Designs, P.O. Box 1982, Placentia, CA 92670, (714) 996-0723.

When it comes to the final step of printing a complete drawing, T.H.I.S. offers exact scaling. With exact scaling, the completed drawing can be printed to scale within 1/64 of an inch. T.H.I.S. allows for the possibilities of templates

## AMAX MacIntosh Emulation Hardware/Software Review by the Unpaid Amigan Reprinted from MAGazine

A company called "Readysoft" is working on a MAC/MACt emulator for the Amiga. AMAX, as it's called, is a software/hardware combination that allows Mac software to run on an Amiga. A hardware adapter plugs into the external disk drive port. This adapter is about 2 inches by 4 inches with a cable to connect it to the drive port. You will need to supply the MAC 64K or MAC+ 128K ROMS for this adapter. There is a pass through for external drives. You can plug your external Amiga drive in here, but for full disk compatibility you will need to add a MAC 800K external drive. You should be able to connect both your external Amiga drive and an external MAC drive to AMAX at the same time.

AMAX compatibility should be very good, but this may depend somewhat on the use of the new chip set from Commodore-Amiga because the MAC looks for one Meg of continuous memory. Readysoft says that they have run PageMaker 1.2 on a 512K 1000 and have devised a method to use all of the memory available on your Amiga, but with a degree of reduced compatibility. AMAX works with all of the three Amiga versions and will use whatever memory you have, but they said that they hadn't tested it with the insider memory expansion yet.

The tentative availability date (they are finalizing packaging and production details now) is February. The bottom line on cost is tentatively $150 for Amax. 64K ROMS, which you must supply, can be had for about $40. This would give you an original MAC. 128K ROMS, you gotta buy 'em yourself, can be obtained for $150 to $175. This would give you a MACt. External MAC drives go for under $200. Remember that these are discount prices. You can expect to pay more if you walk into an Apple dealer. So, to emulate a MACt on your Amiga you need AMAX - $150, 128K ROMS $175, a MAC disk drive - $200, and don't forget the system software, which you can purchase from your local Apple dealer. That adds up to about $525 plus the MAC+ system software and any MAC+ application software you might be interested in. Sounds cheaper than a Bridgecard to me, although finding out exactly what will and will not work to your personal satisfaction will have to wait for at least a couple of months.

Readysoft has used AMAX with Word 3.0, Excel, Hypercard, PageMaker, MacPaint, Mac Write and all system versions and finders. (They did not say whether or not this is with the new chip set or not, though.) They have run Megaroids and Loadrunner but say that copy protection can cause problems with AMAX.

![Image](1989_03_artifacts/image_000009_df7e71953b2ffa42f1d73b837e25450c9545056fdd0aedc356b252e0704fdb64.png)

AMAX runs a little faster than a MACt. The Amiga mouse emulates the MAC mouse with no problems. Screen proportions are good in interlaced or 640 by 400 mode. Several screen formats are available, including a 512 by 342 for full video compatibility. They also support the A2024 monitor in 1008 by 800 line mode and the new chip set which gives 640 by 400 - 40 5 400 non-interlaced. The FlickerFixer should work, but overscan is not supported. Of course, the MAC and MACt are both monochrome machines. Both parallel and serial are supported and AMAX will also work with Apple's Imagewriter Il and Laserwriter printers. In this first release there will be no support for hard drives, multitasking, or AppleTalk, but they are looking at these things for future releases. Midi compatibility seems doubtful because most midi software goes directly to the hardware.

## Commodore's Commercials Information

Reprinted From BRACE

Even Scrooge would smile at the low-cost, high quality commercials Commodore Business Machines created for the past Christmas season. Commodore used its own Amiga personal computer to produce and edit seven 15 second spots aimed at the youth market. These spots were combined to form four 30 second commercials that aired in support of Commodore's holiday promotion of Amiga computers and special VCR bundling program.

By using the Amiga to develop and create the spots, Commodore was able to produce all seven segments for $75,000. This figure is way below the American Association of Advertising Agencies' estimated cost of one 30 second segment at $130,000. According to Julie Bauer, director of marketing services at Commodore, "We used the same Amiga technology available to consumers to produce our ads. It was simple, fast and efficient. The beauty of the Amiga is that it enables professionals to produce their own commercials for a fraction of the cost of what a production company would charge."

Short on time and tight on budget, Griffin-Bacal, Commodore's advertising agency, turned to the Amiga for production of the fun spots which showcase the product's animation, editing and artistic capabilities to viewers of MTV and VH-1.

![Image](1989_03_artifacts/image_000010_3d036d628f806740a95d7669444602fc75bee92fe28cd4da610f987afed1b957.png)

Bauer went on to explain that the viewers of MTV and VH-1, where the spots aired over 1,000 times, have grown up with computers and video technology.

Incorporated into the advertisements was Commodore's holiday promotion of a free video cassette recorder with the purchase of an Amiga 500 personal computer system. Each system consists of the Amiga 500 computer, a stereo color monitor and a Software Starter Kit, which includes entertainment, productivity, video and graphics programs. The free VCR, a $349 value, was announced in the commercials accompanied by a phone number for placing orders (800-343-3000). The promotion began November 6. Supporting print advertisements in major U.S. newspapers ran throughout the holiday season to increase exposure of Commodore's program.

"This audience is interested in computers that do more than number crunch, they want creative computers that benefit them in a variety of ways, both for recreational and professional applications. This is why we view the Amiga as the first truly "hip" computer, allowing consumers to let their artistic talents soar using the product's video, music and graphics capabilities.

## Amiga By-The-Loop Brent Wood

Valentine's Day came and went with a lower than average showing of members at our meeting. However, the conversation was lively and we doubled the number of questions in the Dumb Question Box. (I may change the name. The questions seem to be getting more and more difficult to answer.) We also announced the clubs intention to support Commodore in an upcoming local event. The possibility of an "Ami-Forum" in our area should excite all Amiga users in the club and the MetroPlex area. More info on this event should be available as you read this.

Amazing Computer Systems sent Tim Tripp to show us the Magni Genlock system for the A-2000. This unit (actually two boards and a controller) provides Amiga 2000 owners the capability to sync external video and Amiga graphics for television network quality titling and graphics. Just the thing to give your videos that "broadcast" look. Tim also demonstrated "War in Middle Earth", a new game along the D&amp;D line. Very impressive. And the newest in desktop publishing, Page Stream. (Our newsletter editor was foaming at the mouth over this one.) Very nice showing and thanks again to Amazing Computer and Tim Tripp.

Next meeting will be Tuesday, March 14. (AGAIN?!)

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

Our February meeting featured games. We had an opportunity to see the latest of the Amiga titles - specifically Dragon's Lair and Falcon. A nice demonstration, proving once again that the Amiga, in addition to all its other capabilities, is the definitive game machine.

The February meeting also saw the announcement of the formation of Special Interest Groups (SIG's). If you have a particular subject that interests you, chances are that others do as well. A SIG is a way for people with like interests to get together on a regular basis and talk about that subject, rather than waiting for the club to cover it at a general meeting perhaps once a year. The club can serve as a way to meet others with that interest and this newsletter can serve as a way to publicize your activities. So far, the SIG's forming are in the areas of "Graphics and Animations", "Music" "Programming" ","Desktop Publishing and Word Processing" ", and "Application Software". More information will be provided here as formation progresses.

Our meetings of late have been taking on a different flavor in both the Amiga Central and the Amiga By-The-Loop chapters. The Amiga News / Question and Answer section of the meeting is becoming longer with greater participation from the floor. I, for one, find it very interesting and hope it continues. Along those lines, the "Dumb Question Box" is being used a little more. Have a question that you need to ask anonymously? Put it in the "Dumb Question Box" and see if you can stump our panel of experts. I'm not sure everyone is playing fair - so far none of the questions have been dumb.

## Fort. Worth Ellen Triplett

Before the consolidation of the day and night chapters of the club in the Ft. Worth area, the night chapter was sponsoring an honorary membership for Chance Slitz, a most deserving and talented young computer user. At our February 11, meeting we voted to continue this for his benefit and ours. The program theme of the meeting was "How I Feel About the Printer I Am Using: Its Good Qualities and Its Bad Ones, If Any"

We discovered we have a comedian in our midst. While demonstrating "The Tax Survival Kit", Noel Moore provided us with samples of a dry, rather off-beat sense of humor, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Noel recommends running a printed copy of the directions before using the program, since it does NOT explain procedure on screen during use. He also stated that it is very helpful to use it as a checking device, some months before the end of the tax year, to warn the taxpayer of possible high tax areas that may be offset by putting in motion various tax shelters.

Anita Adler demonstrated her Okidata 120 - Commodore ready. John Sookma followed with a Star Micronics NX1000C Rainbow, also Commodore ready. This one really caught my eye, since it not only uses a four color ribbon (cost about $10.00), but also can be used with an inexpensive black ribbon for ordinary printing. Rich Meyer showed his Panasonic KX-P1092, a very good workhorse type printer which has given over 2 years of hard service and has an excellent 2 year warranty; however, it requires an interface.

At our March meeting, Julia Sookma, a grad school teacher, will discuss the use of computers in the school. We welcome your attendance.

## Arlington/Grand Prairie Eddie Allen

The workshop meeting in the Grand Prairie Library saw a lively discussion about the tax program available to the club members. The meeting was in the auditorium this time.

At the Tuesday night meeting on the 21st, regretfully, Glen Herring was unable to perform his presentation of the Quick Brown Fox, but he has promised to present it in the March meeting with additional embellishments. After filling out a survey form, we were able to drop our names into a drawing for the C64 version of 'Write Stuff", which was won by Hershel Gibbs. Brad Dumler presented a demonstration of the 1988 income tax aid program. He presented both the C64 and C128 version, which is available on the MCCC BBS and your friendly chapter librarian. Due to the courtesy of Budget Computer and Dick Headley, we were able to view, through the magic of home video cameras, an enlightening excursion through the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas back in January.

It was announced at the workshop that there will be an Amiga Forum held in April, probably on the 22nd or the 29th. More details will be coming later. Membership figures for all of the MCCC chapters were also shown. If you have not renewed yet, please come to the next meeting and re-enlist.

The March workshop will be held on the 11th, and the main meeting will convene on the 21st. The scheduled presentation currently consists of Glen's QBB demonstration, and possibly the video tape produced at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES). We will be discussing a possible rescheduling of the April 8th workshop due to the Jim Butterfield presentation by Scope which is scheduled on the same day. Be there.

## Hurst-Euless-Bedford Robyn Wilson

At the February meeting it was announced that there are currently fifty members in the HEB Chapter. In Fred Noble's treasurer report he said the club is in good financial shape. He said the reason why we were in a smaller room than at previous meetings which was to reduce the club expenses. John Malmstrom reported that at the Board of Directors meeting three items were approved for purchase: a Hewlett Packard ink-jet printer and a double-sided Amiga disk drive. Okley Moss said that the Bulletin Board is being used a lot more. He also said that if you are a new user and need a password, log on to the BBS, enter Edit Your Records and change your password. This will protect you from anyone else from using your time on the BBS.

During the meeting, D Paint, Hearsay 1000, JiffyDos and C/PM 128 were discussed. D Paint was discussed by Okley Moss and demonstrated by Robyn Wilson. This is the drawing program to be used on the graphics bulletin board. It is real easy to use - I had leamed it myself in only a few minutes. There is a short list of instructions to guide you through the options and help screens for usage on-line. It can be useful for needlework, too. Just use the quadrant draw mode which has a smaller cursor.

On April 8th and 9th, SCOPE will present Jim Butterfield at the Infomart in Dallas. He will teach a class for programming in BASIC for both Commodore and Amiga Computers. He will speak to the Amiga group on Saturday morning, the Commodore 64/128 group on Saturday afternoon, and will teach a class in BASIC programming on April 9th. In a one-day class Jim can lead students from the first elementary steps to the production of real, useful programs.

Eldor Luedtke, Jr. demonstrated the Hearsay 1000 which is a voice and speech recognizing synthesizer. Some of its uses are for the handicapped and for children learning how to spell. The Hearsay 1000 can hear but it has to be in a controlled situation such as a quiet room and use of one voice only. It can recognize the pitch, voice and speed of your voice or up to four different preset voices. The pitch can be changed from low to high. The speed of his voice can be changed by hitting the keys numbered from 1 - 10, slow to rapid. Hearsay 1000 does not use sid chips.

After John Malmstrom "warmed up" the C/PM 128 audience, Edward Corr started his C/PM discussion. C/PM is a business oriented operating system, not a programming language. An operating system controls communication between you, the keyboard, the disk drives and the console. C/PM is active when you turn on the computer. It is also disk intensive which means that the drive is usually running. You can CP/M 128 on a 40 column screen and there are many built in commands. There is abundant information available for C/PM, just check the main table at the next meeting for a list of sources.

Glen Herring from the Arlington/Grand Prairie chapter talked for a while on JiffyDos for the C64 and C128. It is a fast-load device (actually a set of replacement ROM chips) that works all the time and doesn't use the cartridge port. You can read about it in the August '88 RUN magazine or the February '89 COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Contact Brad Dumler at 817-483-2322 after 5:30 pm M-F or all day weekends for more information. The prices for the C64 version before March 1st are $44.95 and $54.95 for the C128 version. These prices will go up after March 1.

The next meeting will be on March 18, 1989. Same place - same time. Lets keep the membership growing!
