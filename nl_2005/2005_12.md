## Hyperion's OS4 Website

28 October, 2005 With this website, we at Hyperion Entertainment VOF have created a central resource for the community of AmigaOS4.0 users and clients, both present and future. We will shortly be expanding this website to include downloads, a developers area, an FAQ and more features that we hope you will find both useful and informative.

To start things off, we include two sets of articles for your reading enjoyment; you'll see links to them in the menu at the side of the page. From the AmigaOS4.0 link you can access articles intended to give you an introduction to the latest version of the Amiga OS, whether you are an OEM interested in the great advantages AmigaOS4.0 can bring to your platform, a curious end-user who wants to know what has been happening with the Amiga platform in recent years, or a dedicated Amiga enthusiast who has been with us all this time. Below that in the menu side bar, you'll find our special 'Amiga@20' section, celebrating this 20 th anniversary year of the revolutionary Amiga Operating system. In this, you'll find a brief history of the Amiga, as well as a list of our 20 favourite features of AmigaOS4.0, and 20 reasons why we believe AmigaOS4.0 to be a truly unique, innovative and user-friendly OS.

Here you will find nformation and resources relating to the latest release of the Operating System that introduced the world to multimedia and proves the fact that so much of the computing industry has forgotten - that computers can be fun.

20 years after the Amiga Operating System was first unveiled to the public it is returning, better than ever, thanks to a joint effort by Amiga Inc. and Hyperion Entertainment VOF. This new version of the famous OS takes all the features that made the original AmigaOS great, and updates them with the latest requirements for cross-platform 21 st Century computing devices of all sorts. From desktop computers to mobile hardware, AmigaOS4.0 delivers a uniquely accessible, powerful, and above all fun way to use technology.

Whether you are one of the thousands of dedicated enthusiasts for the platform or an ex-user curious to see what's going on, if you are completely new to the Amiga experience or a potential OEM client considering the deployment of AmigaOS 4.0 on your own hardware, we hope you'll find plenty in this website to interest you.

## Sony-BMG's EULA

November 09, 2005 If you thought XCP 'rootkit' copyprotection on Sony-BMG CDs was bad, perhaps you'd better read the 3,000 word (!) end-user license agreement (aka 'EULA') that comes with all these CDs.

First, a baseline. When you buy a regular CD, you own it. You do not 'license' it. You own it outright. You're allowed to do anything with it you like, so long as you don't violate one of the exclusive rights reserved to the copyright owner. So you can play the CD at your next dinner party (copyright owners get no rights over private performances), you can loan it to a friend (thanks to the 'first sale' doctrine), or make a copy for use on your iPod (thanks to 'fair use'). Every use that falls outside the limited exclusive rights of the copyright owner belongs to you, the owner of the CD.

Now compare that baseline with the world according to the Sony-BMG EULA, which applies to any digital copies you make of the music on the CD:

1. If your house gets burgled, you have to delete all your music from your laptop when you get home. That's because the EULA says that your rights to any copies terminate as soon as you no longer possess the original CD.
2. You can't keep your music on any

computers at work. The EULA only gives you the right to put copies on a 'personal home computer system owned by you.'

3. If you move out of the country, you have to delete all your music. The EULA specifically forbids 'export' outside the country where you reside.
4. You must install any and all updates, or else lose the music on your computer. The EULA immediately terminates if you fail to install any update. No more holding out on those hobble-ware downgrades masquerading as updates.
5. Sony-BMG can install and use backdoors in the copy protection software or media player to 'enforce their

6. The EULA says Sony-BMG will never be liable to you for more than $5.00. That's right, no matter what happens, you can't even get back what you paid for the CD.
7. If you file for bankruptcy, you have to delete all the music on your computer. Seriously.
8. You have no right to transfer the music on your computer, even along with the original CD.

9. Forget about using the music as a soundtrack for your latest family photo slideshow, or mash-ups, or sampling. The EULA forbids changing, altering, or make derivative works from the music on your computer.

So this is what Sony-BMG thinks we should be allowed to do with the music on the CDs that we purchase from them? No word yet about whether Sony-BMG will be offering a 'patch' for this legalese rootkit. I'm not holding my breath.
