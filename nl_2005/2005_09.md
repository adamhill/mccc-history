## New Book on Commodore

About the Book

The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore tells the story of Commodore through first-hand accounts by the actual Commodore engineers and managers who made the company. From their entry into computers in 1976 until their demise in 1994, the Commodore years were always turbulent and exciting. Commodore had astounding success with their computers, including the Pet, the Vic-20, the Commodore 64 and the incredible Amiga computers. Although other companies received more press, Commodore sold more computers than either Apple or IBM, with a strong following of computer fans.

## Author's Promise

Throughout the development of this book, I have strived to keep my personal opinions out of the writing. It was my goal to express the opinions of those who were there. I also strived to be fair and balanced to those who were unable to give interviews for the book. This includes majority shareholder Irving Gould, who has since passed away, and Jack Tramiel. (Tramiel's son Leonard was interviewed to represent his father's point of view.) When people gave damning comments about someone, I made an effort to see the other point of view and present it fairly.
