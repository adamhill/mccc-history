## Next-Generation Amiga Architecture

Cologne,  Germany,  November 13 - Amiga Inc. today announced a partnership with QNX Software Systems Ltd. to utilize the QNX realtime operating system (RTOS) as the  foundation  for  the  next-generation  Amiga  architecture.  The announcement was made at Computer '98 in Cologne. The  Amiga  shook  the  industry  in  the  80s  with world-leading multimedia architecture,' said Jeff Schindler, general manager of Amiga Inc. 'QNX's RTOS resembles many of Amiga's unique qualities. It provides the foundation in reaching our vision for the rebirth of Amiga in the new millenium.' We see this partnership as a powerful combination of superior OS technologies, common corporate cultures, and  shared  business  vision,'  said  Dan  Dodge,  Chief Technology  Officer  and  Cofounder  of  QNX  Software Systems Ltd.

## Amiga Developments

The Amiga news front sure has taken a roller coaster ride this  week. After posting the news about the GlowIcons earlier,  several  events  took  place  in  rapid  succession. Fleecey  Moss,  the  man  in  charge  of  3.5  OS  has  been fired!  The  person  in  charge  of  the  GlowIcons  has  now announced  that  GlowIcons  will  not  be  part  of  3.5! Another person at Amiga Inc appears to have lost their website connection. This leaves but four people at Amiga Inc. All of this resulted in a flurry of rumors that 3.5 may or may not come about. The latest has Haage and Partner developing  3.5.  So  far  November  1998  has  been  the busiest month I've seen in awhile for the Amiga. The QNX announcement appears to be getting great feelings going in the Amiga world. Their site has a demo you  can  download,  but  you  need  a  PC.  An  operating system, browser, and TCP/IP stack all on a bootable 1.44 floppy, just to show how compact it is and how well it works. Their site was swamped with downloaders getting it. Go to www.qnx.com and take a look around. …Johnny C. Kitchens

## Humor

The Reverend Henry Ward Beecher entered Plymouth church one Sunday and found several letters awaiting him. He opened one and found it contained the single word, 'Fool.' Quietly and with becoming seriousness he announced to the congregation the fact in these words:

- 'I have known many an instance of a man writing a letter and forgetting to sign his name, but this is the only instance I have ever known of a man signing his name and forgetting to write the letter.'
