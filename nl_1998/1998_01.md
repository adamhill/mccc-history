## Amiga Quakes!

After  months  of  rumours,  it  has  happened  -  the Amiga has Quake . id Soft's legendary super Doom clone first appeared on the Amiga in early 1997 in the form of the Amiquake hack, an unofficial port which was made by a small group of Amiga coders after the source code to the game found its way onto a cracker's bulletin board and made it's way around the internet. Back then legal threats  from  id  Software  stopped  Amiquake  pretty  fast, but  after  months  of  negotiation,  Canadian  software company ClickBoom have acquired a license to sell the Amiga version commercially. It is ironic that Clickboom acquired  the  rights  to Quake after  a  small  group  of hackers was able to prove to the original software house that the Amiga was capable of running the software, as this  is  a  very  similar  story  to  the  one  that  lead  to  the publication of Amiga Myst , also by ClickBoom. Quake ,  second  choice  amongst  Amiga  users responding to the ClickBoom wishlist, is currently about the most popular and well known game on any computing  system,  and  getting  an  conversion  for  the  Amiga  is something of a coup. Currently, Quake only runs on the Sega Saturn, the PC and the Macintosh. Versions for the Nintendo 64 and Playstation are on again off again affairs that have been long awaited but still appear a way off. By contrast  the  Amiga  version  is  already  almost  complete. The Amiga version of Quake has all the features of the PC version.  It  should  be  possible  to  use  a  wide  range  of Quake add-ons,  and  network  access  has  also  been promised. Indeed, we can expect to see Quake 'clans' of Amiga users turning up on the internet based multi-user Quakeworlds. We'll  have  to  wait  and  see  how  well  the  final version of Quake runs on the Amiga before we can tell you exactly how fast it will run on your system, but from what we have seen, it's going to be pretty good. Keeping in  low  resolution,  it  should  be  playable  on  an  AGA machine  with  a  68040  or  better  accelerator,  although clearly the better the processor the better it will run. We'll have  to  wait  for  the  PowerPC  version  to  see Quake running at its best, however. A Quake demo was shown running on a PowerPC by Haage and Partner in Cologne, and it ran at an impressive speed indeed. We have yet to have  confirmation  of  this,  but  it  seems  likely  that Clickboom will also be supporting the Permedia 2 based Cybervision  and  BlizzardvisionPPC  graphics  add-on cards. Quake is noted for using the OpenGL 3D graphics API, which is directly supported on the phase5 cards by the CyberGL implementation of the OpenGL standard. A 68060 Amiga with a graphics card will run Quake rather nicely… a PPC Amiga with the 3D card will be something to  behold.  Look  out  for  the  March  issue  of  CU  Amiga Magazine for more exclusive details.

## Oops!

One night, a Delta twin-engine puddle jumper was flying  somewhere  above  New  Jersey.  There  were  five people on board: the pilot, Michael Jordan, Bill Gates, the Dalai Lama, and a hippie. Suddenly, an illegal oxygen generator exploded loudly in the luggage compartment, and the passenger cabin began to fill with smoke. The cockpit door opened, and the pilot burst into the compartment. 'Gentlemen,' he began, 'I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that we're about to crash in New Jersey. The good news is that there are four parachutes, and I have one of them!' With that, the pilot threw open the door and jumped from the plane. Michael  Jordan  was  on  his  feet  in  a  flash. 'Gentlemen,' he said, 'I am the world's greatest athlete. The  world  needs  great  athletes.  I  think  the  world's greatest  athlete  should  have  a  parachute!'  With  these words, he grabbed one of the remaining parachutes, and hurtled through the door and into the night. Bill  Gates  rose  and  said,  'Gentlemen,  I  am  the world's smartest man. The world needs smart men. I think the world's smartest man should have a parachute, too.' He grabbed one, and out he jumped. The  Dalai  Lama  and  the  hippie  looked  at  one another. Finally, the Dalai Lama spoke. 'My son,' he said, 'I have lived a satisfying life and have known the bliss of True Enlightenment. You have your life ahead of you; you take a parachute, and I will go down with the plane.' The  hippie  smiled  slowly  and  said,  'Hey,  don't worry,  pop.  The  world's  smartest  man  just  jumped  out wearing my backpack.'
