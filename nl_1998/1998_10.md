## Java Explained

[I  received  this  article  via  the  AGM  web  site.  It  is  a response to the article posted there last month which was written by Joe Gilmore of the Queens Amiga User Group. …Bill Raecke]

Java  is  not  a  beginner's  language.  It's  a  big  step  up  in complexity from ARexx or any form of BASIC. That's not to discourage anybody from learning, but just be aware that it will require some dedication.

I  just  found  this  article  today,  and  I  thought  I  might  be able to add a few helpful comments.

From the article… I've  been  looking  at  the  description  of  the  new Amiga. One of the features that has caught my eye is that it will include a 'Java Virtual Machine.' I'm still not sure what that means, with all of the talk of  a  JVM  in  the  computer  press  there  is  no  JVM machine to examine.

The  JVM  is  merely  the  program  that  executes  Java bytecode.  It's  sort  of  like  an  emulator:  it's  a  virtual machine, not a physical one. Any computer that runs Java bytecode must have a JVM.

Somewhere I read that ARexx will be available on the new Amiga, as for ACE it is anyone's guess.

It  is  unknown  whether  the  Super  Amiga  will  have  any form of REXX. Many people are hoping it will. However, Javascript and REBOL are also under consideration for the new sytem.

I  suspect  we  will  see  some  all-new  languages  for  the Super Amiga, especially for beginners or casual programmers.  On  Amiga  we  have  already  seen  Amiga  BASIC, GFA Basic, Hisoft Basic, ACE, AMOS, Blitz, PowerLOGO, CanDo...  All  flops.  None  of  them  have  been  really successful or widespread, with the possible exception of AMOS. It's a shame really. I personally would love to see something similar to CanDo for the new systems.

Since a cup of java is the first thing that I reach for in the morning, I might as well learn to program in it.

There has been a lot of debate about Java among Amiga programmers.  Some think it's great, some think it will lead to 'bloated' and inefficient code. I haven't worked with Java enough to have any opinion on that subject, but I do hope there will be other options available. An Amiga E compiler, for example, would be a very welcome thing. Of  course, the main  point  of Java is platformindependence. The theory is that you can 'write once, run anywhere' with Java.  Right now that remains mostly theory, not practice.

I  thought  that  it  was  a  bit  strange  that  Java  had both  a  compiler  and  an  interpreter  -  most languages have one or the other.

The  compiler  turns  your  sources  into  Java  'bytecode.' The interpreter, also known as the JVM, is what executes the bytecode. It's really more like an emulator than an interpreter.

About Kaffe: The Amiga version is not yet complete. The compiler and JVM work okay, but it lacks some of the APIs.  So,  it's  fine  for  learning  the  basics  of  the  Java language, but it's not yet ready to develop actually useful applications.

Many  of  the  books  that  I  looked  at  only  cover 'Java  Script'  which  is  a  Java  like  language  that Netscape developed for its web browser and is not the Java programming language.

Javascript is not even really a Java-like language.
