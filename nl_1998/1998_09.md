## Fleecy Moss Speaks

The following represents excerpts from an IRC conference recently held by Fleecy Moss. For the full conference text, check the AGM web site.

Q. What is the optimum for a developer box? A. For  OS5Dev,  any  x86  box  will  serve  as  a  base (233+) but since we intend to be on it for as short a time as  possible,  we  will  only  write  drivers  for  one  or  two cards so that will be your problem if you don't go with the AInc solution. We hope to offer a low end and a high end solution.

Q. Will Joe Torre's departure affect development of the new machine, and when can we expect to see the new machine (or proper specs)? A. Joe's departure will affect it in as much as we'll miss the little bugger. He was working closely with the GW2K staff  to  get  the  dev  box  done  but  I  think  most  of  the design work was done. I work from the home and not the office so I don't know. The specs should be out by or at Cologne. As for seeing it, as I explained in csa.misc, the bits are coming together but we are not sure whether ALL the bits will be ready by Cologne. We will show it but it might not be available for sale by then. GW2K are getting 3000 orders a day more than they can fill so we may have to look elsewhere.

Q. What language are we going to be using? I assume 'C' but will it be Gcc ? We need to spend this time before the  release  of  the  Dev  system  learning  the  language NOW. A. C++ first and foremost, then Java. We are talking and  the  ICOA  is  working  on  a  model  to  bring  more languages  as  quickly  as  possible.  I  hope  so  because  I HATE C++.

Q. How  many  major  developers  have  actually  indicated an interest in the platform - enough to make the platform  viable  once  more  ?    Any  'killer  apps'  on  the horizon ? A.

- Developers  -  I  have  spoken  to  as  many  of  the commercial developers as I can and they are a) looking

forwards to developing for OS5 b) wondering how they are going to stay alive long enough to get there. We have plans to help them on both accounts.

- Q. This may sound a bit negative, but I am an seeing-isdesigning OS5 is pretty small. Why do you think you (and

believing kinda person. You just told that the team that is your  team)  can  create  a  complete  new  OS  in  so  little time?  I  mean,  BeOS  for  example  had  a  lot  more developers for a longer time… And even if it could be done, why do you think it will be better than other OS's. A. As a PM of some ten years experience, I can tell you that small teams ARE the best - always. They maintain focus  and  consistency  in  a  design.  Once  the  design  is completed, then you can bring more programmers in on the  job.  Why  do  I  think  it  will  be  better?  Because  of Allan, and the ppl he is bringing into this? These ppl are top in their fields and once we take them on board and announce them,  you  will  see  that.  These  are  ppl  who want to be the next great thing and who feel stymied in existing  companies.  They  have  found  a  home  with  us. Time is a concern, as always - but we have lots of Jolt.

- Q. Maybe a silly  question,  but:  I  have  read  that  you hope to have Amigas out for $500. How would you be able to manage to sell a product like this at such a low low price? (and do you mean just the motherboard for $500 or HD, CD, Monitor etc..). How can GW be willing to  fund  such  a  high  risk  project  at  such  low  profit margins, are they planning on dumping the PC for the
2. SuperAmiga? A. Have you looked at the Dreamcast specs and price, the Project X? HW technology is coming together, and the MMC adds several new twists to it. Will GW2k abandon PCs - not until we have proved we make them redundant.
- Q. Any plans for a laptop Amiga? and will ARexx still be part of future AmigaOS's? (updated maybe?)
- A. As I said before, the MMC can work perfectly well in a laptop. If Pios or P5 or someone wants to make one then it will be fine with us. Arexx? Allan likes it, I like it.
