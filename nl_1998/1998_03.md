## Amiga's Rebirth

February 6th, 1998. To our AMIGA Community By Darreck Lisle, Events Coordinator AMIGA, Inc.

Friends, have you been hearing those cries of, 'The end is near? The end is near!' on the Internet and in your favorite  Amiga  magazine?  We've  heard  them  too,  but with a difference! You see, what we're hearing is that the end of the `bad old days' is here and the Amiga has a bright future ahead of it! Now, we're not going to say this will be easy and it certainly won't happen overnight. There are many things that need to be done. Not all of these things are obvious and few of them are what you would call high visibility changes. What we've got to do is dig the cellar again and rebuild  the  foundations  of  the  Amiga  and  the  Amiga market. You should already be seeing the results of this. For example:

- There are over a dozen licensees of the Amiga making Amigas and Amiga clones. New models with new features have already shipped. In the coming months you'll be seeing a lot more about these machines and you'll learn about companies with names like DCE, Index Information Systems, Micronik, Quick Pak, Nova Sector. You'll be able to buy Amigas that are faster, and more powerful than ever before. As more of these machines get in the hands of the writers and editors out there, you'll find out about them.
- The Amiga games market is growing and taking control! Commodore determined the base configuration a game maker could count on for his audience. Now
- games like Myst , The Shadow of the Third Moon , Quake and others require CDROM, hard drives, and 4 megs or more of RAM. And guess what? The games are selling faster than ever

because if a user didn't already have these features in their Amiga, they're getting their Amiga's upgraded!

- New software applications are coming out and old applications are getting upgraded. You can get Aladdin 4D 5.0 , Tornado 3D 1.0 , Electric Dreams , Wildfire , Directory Opus Magellan , ImageFX 3.0 and many, MANY, more titles.
- The Amiga trade shows are getting bigger and better than ever. Last year the Midwest Amiga Expo, St. Louis' Amiga '97 and Koln's Computer '97 set new attendance records for both Amiga dealer/company participation and for user attendance as well! This year we are looking forward to St. Louis' Amiga '98, International Amiga '98 in Toronto, Canada, AmiWest in Sacramento, the 1998 Midwest Amiga Expo (which promises to be twice as big yet again!), and shows again in the UK and Germany as well.

Things  aren't  just  happening  within  the  Amiga community,  no  sir!  Wired  magazine  and  several  news services  have  run  stories  about  the  Amiga  revival. Mainstream computer magazines have been referring to 1998 as the year that alternative computer platforms, like the  Amiga, will be gaining market share again. Amigas are  still  used  in  mission  critical  applications  where reliability  and  integration  has  been  the  key.  The  Amiga goes to war in the M1 Abrams tank, up into space with the Space Shuttle and down to the ocean floor to help explore  the  wreck  of  the  Titanic  for  James  Cameron's film.  Of  course,  nearly  everyone's  local  television  and cable station still has several Amigas in house for video work if you want something a bit closer to home! You're going to be seeing a lot more of our work take form over this year. More new 'Powered by Amiga' based  machines.  An  upgraded  AmigaOS.  Coordinated developer resources and user group resources.

1998 is going to be a fun ride!
