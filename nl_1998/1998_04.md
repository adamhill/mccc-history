## Gateway '98 The First Amiga Show of the Year

## by Johnny C. Kitchens

S everal months back, Mark Stodola and I came up with a great idea. Why not try to go to one of these Amiga shows. The first show to be announced… Gateway '98. This  show  received  a  nice  review  in  '97  and  it  was  a reasonable distance compared to most of them. Mark was able to get good pricing on the tickets for the flight. For me, the flight was as exciting as the show, since I had never been up in a plane. I could hardly wait! We bought all the tickets  in  advance,  reserved  our  room,  and  generally planned everything. It took forever for the day to arrive. It only struck me a few days before that we were leaving on Friday the 13th. Everything went very smoothly. We flew from DFW to Atlanta, and from there to St. Louis. We arrived at the Harley Hotel, a renamed Hemsley, at  12:40pm.  On  the  side  of  the  hotel  was  sign  of  huge proportions proclaiming the Amiga show being held there. What a sight… and it could be seen from a distance. The main part of the show would only be available on  Saturday  and  Sunday.  For  Friday,  14  classes  were scheduled,  covering  most  of  the  day.  Some  classes  cost, some were free. The free ones interested me the most. I had chosen a class on the new Boxer motherboard. This is the new  motherboard  generating  much  excitement  in  the Amiga community, with all the new enhancements it will bring  to  the  Amiga.  The  class  fell  through  when  the speaker failed to show. We, instead, got a class from Motorola and Skipper Smith. Skipper Smith oddly enough has been known to me for quite awhile, in name. I have communicated with him quite  a  few  times  over  the  years,  through  telecommunications. How nice it was to see him in person. The class was packed and there was standing room only. (This theme was repeated for quite a few of the shows I attended.) Skipper Smith really knows his stuff and presented a very interesting  class.  He  pointed  out  that  Motorola  was  still aggressively  developing  the  PowerPC,  and  why  we  have

Motorola is outselling Intel in the CPU market. Want to find out why? If you come to our meeting we are going to show this class, as Mark did tape it, as well as good deal of the rest of the show… or at least as much as we could get on two tapes. The other problem with the classes, and I think many agreed, was that they were too short. They were all set to 45 minutes. A few worked in that amount of time, but the rest seemed to be just getting started when they would end. The rest of Friday was rather quiet for me as I was beginning to feel the effects of just four hours of sleep, plus the  excitement.  I  saw  Petro  Tyschtschenko  for  the  first time, and Mark went to a class on licensing presented by him. I began the first of many up and down chases after a CyberstormPPC. I found Greg Scott of National Amiga, a mail-order Amiga dealer, if he had a  233MHz CyberstormPPC. He said yes, and I thought my worries of waiting  were  over.  I  went  to  his  room  where  it  was  a beehive of activity with wall to wall Amiga products being sorted out in preparation for Saturday. He finally found the card only to discover it had no 060 on board. I chased after that card the whole weekend, only to find it was 200MHz. There was big party Friday night for the developers, which I got to see part of. Loud music featuring the Blues Brothers really shook the place, and more than a few were feeling the effects of the party the next day. Saturday started early,  first  class  started  at  9:15.  We  attended  one  on  C programming, and I was very happy to see some real talent still  working  with  the  Amiga.  This  was  the  smallest attended class I attended - no doubt the early time had an affect on that. The  next  class  featured  the  User  Group  Network, which appears to be trying to bring all user groups closer together  by  providing  a  common  ground  for  exchange between  the  user  groups.  Such  things  as  brochures,  information, a library for newsletter articles, and chat rooms nothing  to  worry  about.  His  biggest  revelation  was  that

on the Internet. Attending the meeting was Jeff Schindler,

the man in charge of the Amiga from Gateway. He took notes and asked questions, and showed a real interest. This meeting was way too short, in part due to technical difficulties with a computer that apparently was to be used, but wasn't.

Using a Mandelbrot program that allows switching between the 060 and the PowerPC, I could measure the difference in speed between the 50MHz 68060 and the 200MHz 604e. What took 40 seconds on the 060, took but 3 seconds on the 604e.

At  11:00am  the  main  room  was  opened  and  the buying  started.  It  was  very  hard  to  get  around  in  some places. The hardest to get into was National Amiga. I have never seen so many people packed into such a small spot. It was nonstop buying frenzy for them for most of Saturday! At their booth I saw the new Amiga PowerTower… serial number 1, by the way. It has a new look from the 4000T and  it  features  the  CyberstormPPC  and  Picasso  IV  as standard. I ran some quick tests on it and can say it is fast! Using  a  Mandelbrot  program  that  allows  switching between the 060 and the PowerPC, I could measure the difference  in  speed  between  the  50MHz  68060  and the 200MHz 604e. What took 40 seconds on the 060, took but 3 seconds on the 604e.

I saw people I had only seen pictures of  or  read  about  all  over  this  room, there was even someone from back home present… Eldor from Commodore Country was there wheeling  and  dealing.  Holger Kruse was there selling Miami and  explaining  it.  It is a wonder  he  still  has  voice.  I saw  the  Siamese  system  for  the

Someone had painted an eight ball to look like boing ball. There  were  little  boing  balls  everywhere.  They  had presented Joe Torres with shoes painted as boing balls and they  had  speakers  on  them  so  that  they  made  the  boing sound  as  he  walked.  The  yellow  ballons  had  the  saying 'Future  so  bright  you  gotta  wear...',  in  reference  to  the shades of course.

The next big thing was the door prizes, featuring a 4000T. It took nearly an hour to go through all the stuff they  wanted  to  give  away  before  getting  to  the  4000T. Originally it was going to be just the computer, but at the last minute a monitor was included. I have to say that was one happy guy! The final event for Saturday was the $30 banquet. It had sold out weeks in advance, so I was happy that we had ordered early. There was lots of food, and we got a speech from Petro Tyschtschenko, a very long speech from Mitch Stone, who apparently is anti-Microsoft, and Jeff Schindler. There was some disappointment for me here. I was hoping for some big announcement, and there were none. Mr. Schindler made it sound as if there would be a question and answer session after his speech and that did not happen. All in all, a rather quiet ending for a rather exciting day.

first time in action. He actually had an Amiga in a duffel bag, connected to PC. He announced that he was taking advanced orders for an Amiga on a PCI card. It features all the custom chips on the card. He has built two of them and they work, but he did not show them. He needs 500 orders to begin production of the cards. That afternoon I attended a class from Asimware on their new product MasterISO 2.0 . With this product the Amiga can burn CDs with the best of them. There seemed to nothing it cannot do with either CD-R or CD-RW. He convinced me and I bought a copy.

Two decorations stood out at the show… boing ball and  yellow  ballons  with  smiley  faces  wearing  sunglasses.

Sunday I spent most of my time in the show looking around for the bargains that might pop up as the day drew to a close.  Mark attended a class on Opus and attended  a U s e r G r o u p l u n c h e o n . Maybe he will have time to tell us about  it at a meeting, hint hint. The big  thing  for  Sunday  was the  door  prizes  where  they were  giving  away  a  Toaster  4000 card and a 1200. It took well over an hour to get through all of the door prizes before the big two. It took four tries for them to get  a  winner  for  the  1200.  After  one  name  was  called, everyone thought there was a winner and began leaving, only to have everyone get called back to draw again. Then it was all over. As we left the hotel we noticed a Holiday Inn had a large boing ball on top… or at least it seemed to be.

The  trip  back  went  half-way  as  planned.  We  saw several  people  from  the  show  at  the  St.  Louis  airport, including  the  4000T  winner.  We  made  it  to  Atlanta  on schedule,  but  then  our  problems  began.  I  saw  more  of Atlanta's  airport  than  our  own  DFW,  not  to  mention spending 8 hours in the thing. Getting home sure was nice, but I am ready to try it again. AGM

## Pre\Box - Taking The Next Step

PowerPC Multiprocessing and AmigaOS 3.1 An Important Announcement From Phase 5 Digital Products

B eside the finalization of upcoming products such as the CyberVisionPPC and the BVisionPPC graphics c a r d s , phase 5 di g i t a l products (http://www.phase5.de/)  has  started  a  new  development project for a stand-alone, PowerPC-based computer system, called the pre\box, which will use the licensed AMIGA OS 3.1 and a further advanced version of the PowerUP System Software to provide Amiga compatibility on the AMIGA OS/Workbench 3.1 level under CyberGraphX V3.

'The  license  agreement  that  we  have  signed  with Amiga  International  allows  us  to  start  the  development

All systems will come as multi-processing systems with at least four PowerPC CPUs installed, which will allow them to provide an extremely high computing power at an outstanding price/performance relation.

project of this new machine, which had been in conceptual design for several months now. It is an important step for revitalizing the Amiga market, encouraging developers and rebuilding a market which is strong enough to maintain' says  Wolf  Dietrich,  General  Manager  of  phase  5.  In  a separate  announcement  Dietrich  states  that  the  A\BOX, the  long-term  technology  project  of  phase  5  digital products,  is  postponed  but  not  cancelled.  'The  A\BOX project  will  be  continued  with  revised  targets  and specifications  and  with  extended  resources,  based  on  the succesful introduction of the new product lines.' Dietrich points out that the key for the survival of the Amiga and the  Amiga  market  is  the  availability  of  new  outstanding stand-alone hardware products as soon as possible, a goal which shall be reached with the pre\box design. 'We need an expanding market in the very near future, or the battle may be lost for the Amiga computer system' he adds.

The  new  pre\box  machines  will  be  targeting  the medium  and  upper  price  regions  for  PCs  or  Personal Workstations, but are designed to provide stunning performance. All systems will come as multi-processing systems with  at  least  four  PowerPC  CPUs  installed,  which  will allow them to provide an extremely high computing power at  an  outstanding  price/performance  relation.  'Multiprocessing has been one of the most important goals, if not THE  most  important  design  goal  for  phase  5  digital products in the past 18 months' explains Wolf Dietrich. 'It is  here  where alternative technology can offer advantages and superiority over the mainstream products in the PC market. While our current PowerUP product line, which consists of upgrade cards for existing machines, helps the user to update his system and secure the investments made in existing hardware and software, it is a challenge to build new stand-alone hardware products which can price-wise compete with the mainstream PCs - especially under the impression  that  PC  systems  are  blown  out  at  dumping prices  regularly,  and  that  a  PC  system  you  buy  today maybe outdated and nearly worthless in less than a year.'

Consequently, the company does not plan to build single-CPU  systems  which  would  have  to  compete  at  a similar  performance  level  with  Intel-based  systems,  but wants to fully utilize  the  opportunities  which  have  been given  with  the  move  to  the  PowerPC.  'Developers  who jump on the PowerUP bandwagon today can make their products ready for multiprocessing quite easily. Therefore it will  be  possible  to  take  two  giant  steps  -  from  a  singleCPU  68k  system  to  a  Multi-CPU  PowerPC  system  within only one year, an impressive progress for the Amiga community  which  many  have  not  thought  possible' Dietrich adds.

The pre\box system is designed on a ATX formfactor motherboard  and  incorporates  a  fast  SDRAM-based memory subsystem with initially up to 100 MHz memory speed. Depending on the actual bus speed of the PowerPC processors which are used, the processor bus also runs at up to  100  MHz.  The  four  PowerPC  processors,  which  are located  on  a  separate  CPU  card,  will  be  equipped  with inline or backside caches, also depending on which type of processor  is  actually  used.  As  the  PowerUP  System Software  features  a  software-controlled  cache  coherency, the pre\box can even be equipped with CPUs which do not offer  hardware  support  for  multiprocessing,  such  as  the PPC603e or the PPC750 (G3).

The  pre\box  system  also  has  an  integrated  3D graphics subsystem, which is connected via a 66 MHz PCI 2.1 bus with a peak performance of 264 MB/s and comes with  eight  MB  of  graphics  memory.  With  this  gfx  subsystem, a powerful standard is provided as the minimum base  configuration  on  which  software  designers  can  rely. But more than that: On the same 66 MHz PCI bus there is a  special  slot  for  a  Voodoo2-based  3D  accelerator  card which is directly coupled to the built-in gfx chip. 'We plan to provide, either on our own or in cooperation with other vendors, a Voodoo2-based solution as a powerful upgrade option' comments Wolf Dietrich. 'We will not forget the demands of the serious gamers.'

Also as  standard,  there  will  be  an  integrated  UltraWide SCSI-II controller and a 100 Mbit ethernet controller

phase 5

available, which will allow usage of today's powerful UWSCSI devices  and  provide  fast  network  connectivity  -  a feature  which  will  also  support  the  distributed  multiprocessing concepts of phase 5 digital products.

For  the  use  of  inexpensive  hardware  expansions,  a PCI bus with three standard PCI slots is integrated. This PCI bus runs at 66 MHz, but will also accept 33 MHz PCI boards. With the PCI bus integrated, development of new stunning  hardware  products  for  the  pre\box  systems  is quite easy; more than that, developers can use standard PCI products  and  adopt  them  for  the  pre\box  systems  by simply writing software support for them.

WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE TOMORROW?™

These prices are valid for pre\box systems in an ATX minitower,  including  mouse  and  keyboard,  as  well  as AMIGA  OS  3.1  and  the  PowerUP  System  Software, excluding memory, harddrive and CD-ROM. For an entrylevel  configuration  of  memory,  harddrive  and  CD-ROM (32MB, 4GB, 24speed) an additional DM 750, (US$ 375.00 or  UKP  275.00)  must  be  considered.  (German  and  UK prices include VAT. US prices excl. local taxes, all prices are based on the current currency exchange rates. Specifications and prices are subject to change without prior notice.)

Yet  not  decided  is  if  there  will  be  a  socket  for  an optional  68k  CPU  left  on  the  board.  'In  this  nextgeneration product, the consequent option for using 68k software will be emulation. We are continuously encouraging  Amiga  developers  to  support  our  new  MP  software technologies and guidelines which we introduced with our PowerUP System Software,  and  those  who  follow  these recommendations will be able to provide applications that utilize  the  vast  power  of  our  upcoming  pre\box  system right away. This is where efforts should be spent now' says Wolf Dietrich.

Beside these main features, the pre\box will offer all standard functionality which is expected from a computer system today, such as fast serial  and  parallel  interfaces,  a USB bus, and an EIDE interface for use of e.g. inexpensive CD-ROM drives or additional cheap harddrives.

The pre\box release is scheduled for the early fourth quarter 1998. The pricing of the pre\box system is already determined  based  on  the  current  pricings  for  PowerPC processors. Currently it is planned to offer the following versions of the pre\box with the following suggested retail prices:

- pre\box 604/800 with four PPC604e-200 MHz CPUs suggested retail price: DM 3.995, US$ 1995.00, UKP 1495.00
-  pre\box 604/1000 with four PPC604r-250 MHz CPUs suggested retail price: DM 4.995, US$ 2495.00, UKP 1895.00
-  pre\box 604/1200 with four PPC604r-300 MHz CPUs suggested retail price: DM 6.995, US$ 3395.00, UKP 2595.00
-  pre\box 750/1200 with four PPC750-300 MHz CPUs, each with 1 MByte Backside Cache suggested retail price:

DM 8.995, US$ 4495.00, UKP 3395.00

In  order  to  support  and  encourage  customers  of PowerUP  boards  for  existing  Amigas,  phase  5  digital products will offer substantial discounts on the purchase of pre\box systems to owners of PowerUP boards. 'We want to provide security for the investments of the users today. Obviously, Amiga users and developers need to see a fast growing base of PowerPC systems in these days, in order to support  the  progress  of  developments.  We  want  to  encourage the users to invest in PowerPC technology now' comments Wolf Dietrich. Owners of PowerUP boards who later  take  advantage  of  the  discounts  on  purchases  of  a pre\box  system  will  not  have  to  return  their  PowerUP boards  to  receive  this  discount,  but  can  continue  to  use their PowerUP-Amiga as a stand-alone system or even use its performance from the pre\box via a link system which will  be  provided  with  the  pre\box,  and  with  which  the networked multiprocessing feature of the PowerUP System Software can be utilized.

With  this  new  product  roadmap  and  variety  of powerful and stunning products to come, phase 5 digital products underscores its position as the leading innovator in PowerPC hardware and system software development in the Amiga market. 'We want to further support the Amiga market with these efforts' states Wolf Dietrich. 'Part of our efforts  will  also  be  to  support  the  developers,  and  to encourage  them  to  develop  for  PowerUP  with  our  best endeavours. We will do whatever is possible for us to make existing developers stay with the Amiga, and will also try to win back Amiga developers who have left the platform or put developments on hold. Recent releases of PowerUP compatible  software  products,  which  had  been  realized within just a few weeks by their developers, show how easy and  efficiently  existing  Amiga  software  products  can  be ported  to  support  the  new  processor  and  performance generation. To convince software developers, we also need to  make  them  aware  of  the  market  potential  and  the outlook to the future that we offer. All users can support these  efforts,  too,  by  contacting  their  favourite  Software vendors  and  requesting  PowerUP  versions  of  their  software.' AGM

## An Amiga For the PC

Siamese Systems Is Accepting Pre-Orders for a PCI Amiga Board By Stephen Jones, Managing Director, Siamese Systems, Ltd.

F or immediate release 4th March 1998. As you are probably aware, the Siamese System has been developed to bring the Amiga into the mainstream computer market to create a hybrid Amiga/Windows platform that can bring rewards to the Amiga owner by giving them access to the low cost PC components, and to the PC owner by bringing the richness of  the  Amiga  software  base.  Initially  the  Siamese  System worked with Serial (for RTG) and SCSI (for File Transfer), followed by v2.5 which now uses the Ethernet and TCP/IP protocol. Now we are working on Siamese v4.0 which is based around a complete AGA Amiga on a PCI card which can take a 33mhz 68040 or a 66mhz 68060.

This  system  has  many  aims  in  life  which  are  as follows:-

-  To give Amiga owners the Ultimate and fastest Amiga ever, and one that is fully backward compatible.
-  To push the Amiga Alpha project into the next stage and giving the Amiga the Alpha chip power.
-  To create the Ultimate Hybrid machine using Amiga / Macintosh / Windows operating systems in one box.
-  To give the PC access to the Macintosh software market and creating a hybrid Macintosh / PC using this card.
-  To give the PC and Mac owners a new software base of the great and inexpensive Amiga software.

However, we face a dilemma with the Amiga market in the position it is in with users holding back on investing in Amiga hardware until they see something happening at Amiga Inc. We are working on the Macintosh version of this product because we know there is a very large market for this innovative product, born out by the hundreds of emails received since the press release was sent out last week.

However, we are concerned about the lack of activity in the Amiga market. Even though the Siamese system has sold in reasonable numbers, being the best selling product at many dealers, this is not what we would consider selling in a strong enough volume to encourage us to invest the many thousands of pounds necessary to create a full Amiga version of the Siamese v4. This project is not just software and involves expensive hardware design work, therefore we must be financially very careful.

As many should be aware, I have backed the Amiga since  1988  and  have  stuck  solely  with  this  market  until now,  but  financial  pressures  are  forcing  us  to  push  into other markets to survive. Having read the announcement from  Vulcan  software  I  can  only  agree  and  applaud  his brave  and  from  the  heart  comments.  I  believe  that  by pushing into another market that is prepared to upgrade to newer hardware we can earn the revenues needed to create new and exciting Amiga products, and bring back the old Amiga user who could afford to support the development community. A knock on effect would be that these new PC/Mac  users  could  later  be  turned  onto  the  Amiga software market with a simple upgrade disk, we call this 'Amiga by Stealth.'  As  I  hope  you  can  see,  this  is  very important for the future of the Amiga and can have a very beneficial effect on the Amiga developers by selling their software to Mac owners running on the Siamese v4 Amiga.

Now to the main point of this message posting, we need to be sure that there is a market for this great new Amiga product that we are preparing before we invest in the development. So we need to know how many people will order this product upon completion, are prepared to put down a deposit on the final price, and pay the balance within  30  days  of  availability.  The  retail  price  of  this product excluding CPU is to be £399.00 including UK vat, and $499 in the US.

We  are  working  the  deposit  on  a  sliding  scale  approach so that the bigger the deposit the more you will save on the final price. The chart is based on the UK price and this is the amount the UK and European price will be based on. Bear in mind that the deposit is non-refundable unless we do not deliver the product. Time for delivery would be about  three  to  four  months  from  the  date  of  the  final decision on whether this product should go ahead.

- 25.00 deposit Total price to pay inc. deposit - £375.00 saving of £25.00
- £50.00 deposit Total price to pay inc. deposit - £350.00 saving of £50.00
- £100.00 deposit

Total price to pay inc. deposit - £325.00 saving of £75.00

If  you are a dealer, you can pre-order from the first batch and if you meet the right order quantities you can become a distributor for that territory. Obviously the same rule  applies  and  a  deposit  must  be  paid  up  front.  Please contact us if you wish to be a dealer and we will send you the special introduction prices.

There is a time scale on this, and if we do not reach near enough to the 500 units the product will have to be dropped, I am sorry but that is the way it has to be. We have invested everything in this Amiga market and can not do it any longer unless there are people who are willing to order the product. This is not a new idea and it happens in

many  other  areas  where  there  is  a  very  small  potential market.

As you can see, it is worth paying the deposit; and as long as we meet a target of 500 boards we will invest the money needed into the Amiga version of the 'Siamese PCI Amiga.'  This  may  seem  like  an  extraordinary  way  to develop a product but the software is 80% complete and the hardware is 60% complete. However the development cost is too high when the Amiga buying public have become so lethargic about paying for new Amiga products and at the same time complain about the lack of development.

Remember, we are not a large  company  with  deep pockets;  we  are  an  Amiga  company  working  in  the  best tradition of the Computer market on a tight budget and with more ideas than money. I hope that you will see the sense in this and understand that we want this new Amiga to  appear,  but  we  cannot develop it just for fun, it must have a market to sell to. I have already had a large amount of  interest  in  this  board  and  I  am  confident  that  this confirmed  order  scheme  will  work,  which  is  why  I  am risking a good flaming to put the reality out there to the community. I hope that this is acceptable to most Amiga users. The ones I have field tested this on have all been very positive and encouraged me to continue, so this is now up to you. Are you in or out?

For those who say how can it be faster than any other Amiga, well it works like this: All I/O, graphics display, sound  and  file  operations  will  be  processed  by  the  host PC/Alpha processor, and the bandwidth across the PCI bus is  about  10  times  the  Zorro3  bus  speed.  Therefore  the 680x0  processor  just  sends  a  simple  system  request  and carries on processing code. We expect to give between 50100% effective speed increase for the processor being the equivalent of a 133mhz 68060. To back this up, the Amiga will have OpenGL using the Host PC and its graphics card to  render  and  therefore  again  no  work  for  the  68060. Finally, an average PC graphics card will always be faster than an Amiga card because of the increase in bus speed that this new system will have access to. Also, if this card is fitted into the Alpha, the gradual Amiga porting will give incredible  performance  increases  way  in  advance  of  any PowerPC chip based card.

Finally,  let  me  talk  about  money  as  this  is  very important. You can buy a cheap 233mhz PC for around 600.00.  Add  the  Siamese  PCI  card  and  a  processor  from your existing accelerator, (if removable) and, for 1000, have the most innovative computer on the Planet.

What about games? Well, this card has a full AGA chip set on board, so most games should work without any problems through the Amiga Video output. Also, if you wanted to create a hybrid Analogue / Digital video system with your existing Genlock you could with this card. This is something sadly lacking in the budget video world. Again another Amiga first.

Please  check  out  our  web  site  (www.siamese.co.uk) for more details about the potential of the card and, if you want to join the plan, there is an e-mail form to fill in and we will send you the paper work. AGM

Firstly, I have been overwhelmed by the response to my  first  announcement  on  the  4th  March  by  the amount of  people  who  want  to  see  this  product  on  the market as I do. We received 200 e-mail orders within 5 days of the announcement going onto the Internet. We actually had close to 500 enquiries about this product, but obviously not everyone can make an instant decision and some want to know more, but 50% is very encouraging.

Obviously,  these  people  have  not  all  paid  their deposits although they are starting to come through and are being  put  into  a  holding  bank  account  until  the  final decision is taken. I feel, due to the fact that as most people wanted on average to pay £50.00 deposit, if they all come in before the end of the month we will go ahead with this Amiga version.

One question that half of the people have asked, is, will there be a PowerPC version? This is a simple Yes, but depends upon certain things happening in the right order first.

Conditions for PowerPC version:

1.  If the Amiga market waits for the PowerPC version, it will NOT happen, this is a usual trick of the Amiga community of waiting until the next version, which ultimately kills the development market. It can only happen if the original version is a successful product and we will then develop a new version later.
2.  There needs to be a mainstream PowerPC software base which there is not as yet.
3.  We will not offer the slow 200mhz PPC chips as they will not offer much more than our 66mhz '060 PCI card, check out our Web site for the explanation.
4.  As long as Amiga Inc. develop a full blown PowerPC Amiga OS.
5.  If it is a better option than our Samsung supported Project Alpha 800Mhz machine later in the year, for under £2000.00 complete, which we believe will outperform any PowerPC system including multiple processor systems, and have the 3D and 2D graphics to leave the Amiga competitors behind.

I want people to understand that we are very serious about the Amiga, but we can only deliver products that people will buy. So, for a while, you will see us doing this until  the  Amiga  market  turns  around  and  becomes  a profitable  niche.  We  want  to  do  much  more  with  the Amiga  including,  one  day,  an  Alpha  set-top  box  based around the Amiga OS and better chip set; but to do this we must  develop  the  right  products  that  are  viable  and  not based  on  a  wild  imagination…  in  other  words  on  what people actually want and NEED. Please read this FAQ for more information.

Siamese V4 PCI Card FAQ

- Q. How does the PCI Amiga allocate its ram.
- A. It has in this version 2mb Chip ram on board, which allows the chip set direct access to Chip ram without the complications of going onto the PCI bus. The Fast ram will use memory allocated on the very fast PCI bus. This will be allocated by the Host OS and will therefore support the facility of virtual memory if required, or this can be bypassed if wished. Memory will be allocated as needed or given at boot up time depending on the way decided. It will be very flexible for tight memory systems and if you have a lot of memory, which is cheap, it will be very fast.
- Q. Does it have the Amiga chip set for Video and games?
- A. The card has the full AGA chip set with a full Amiga Video output port which will be Genlock compatible, allowing the creation of a hybrid Analogue / Digital Video system to be created with the Scala program running fast titles over the top. This will allow Tape based Video editors to incorporate digital footage from the host PC and Analogue video to be combined.
- Q. What about Video Toaster users?
- A. How many time have Video Toaster users asked, 'when will there be a PC Toaster?' Ok, less than 'when will there be a PAL toaster,' but still a lot of Video professionals have wanted to have the Holy grail of a Toaster on the PC or more so the Alpha. The Siamese v4 PCI Amiga card has a full but miniaturized Amiga Video slot on board. This, with a special adaptor and external box, will hold the Newtek Video Toaster card. Running RTG will enable the Switcher control panel to appear on the PC or Alpha display and the Toaster will have access to all of the drives and network of the Host machine. It will even be able to see the Digital video output from the PC/Alpha Digital video recording card while a PCI version of the Flyer is developed! (Are you listening Newtek?)
- Q. What about a CPU slot to take A1200 or A4000 Cpu cards?
- A. This, unfortunately, is almost impossible for a number of technical and physical size problems. Firstly, it would be incredibly complicated to integrate any existing Amiga card into the PCI Amiga system because of the

way they usually take over the system. From the physical point of view, there is no way that the PCI card bay could accept a plug-in card. There is just no room. Anyway, a new version would be available as an upgrade.

- Q. How will the graphics performance compare to the Cybergraphics system?
- A. This is hard to confirm until the product ships… however, with the PCI minimum bandwidth of 133mbytes/sec and Zorro3 at about 10% of this figure, the Siamese V4 RTG should be a LOT faster than existing Cybergraphics and probably the same, if not faster, than future PowerPC versions. Remember that the graphics are actually being pushed around by either an Alpha 533 processor or a Pentium. All of this is orchestrated  by the Bus Master Amiga PCI card; and the slave Pentium processor just does what it is told.
- Q. What about compatibility with CyberGL 3D?
- A. Siamese V4 RTG supports OpenGL fully and, after talks with Phase5, the Siamese v4 RTG will support the CyberGL 3D system calls and convert them where necessary to the OpenGL equivalents. The System will use the host PC to handle all of the number crunching while the Amiga processor can sit back and get on with the next job in hand. This is what we mean by MultiProcessing. We are basically falling back on the original ideas of the Amiga but using modern cheap components to achieve the great speed needed, and letting other people design the instruments in the new Amiga orchestra.
- Q. Why is the 66mhz 060 going to compete with the 200mhz PowerPC based A1200 and A4000 systems?
- A. This is a brief answer and a more detailed one is on this web site. Basically, on average, an operation on a RISC PowerPC chip will take more CPU cycles than the 68060 chip. This is not in dispute. Probably, on average, a two to one basis. Therefore, roughly speaking, the

68060 could, if it was converted to RISC based performance, be about 133mhz. Next, the fact that PowerPC must emulate the 68000 instructions will slow down execution of 68000 code that is not rewritten. ie. 95% of Amiga software and the entire AmigaOS. Finally, the PowerPC chip is sitting in, basically, a 5-year plus old design with very slow graphics and Chip communication and ram access speeds. Whereas the Siamese PCI 060 card is in a state-of-the-art PCI motherboard with potentially a 233mhz and upwards slave processor and fast PCI bus system for very little cost.

- Q. What about 16 bit sound performance and existing Amiga 8 bit sound?
- A. Because all PCs have high quality 16-bit sound, the Amiga will have access to this through an AHI driver, which we hope will be taken up as part of any future OS upgrade. The existing Amiga 8-bit Audio will run through the PCI Amiga card and be  routed through the mixer on the PC sound card. Should you have a better sound card in your PC like the Yamaha XG sound card, then the Amiga will have access to a Wave-based Synthesiser.
- Q. What do Gateway and Amiga Inc. think of this product? A. Ask them.
- Q. You talk about the Alpha porting project, how does this card help?
- A. The Porting project is something that is a long term aim of this company and one that we cannot do alone. A number of things must be in place before we go ahead with this porting process. Namely the Amiga OS must be firstly assembled into a form  that can be converted, which has not been done as yet. Then the entire OS C source code needs to made available to us. As to the actual question, the card will handle all non-ported code and allow it to run with full backward  compatibility, including the Amiga chip set calls. The Alpha based Amiga has the potential to take on any processor or even Multi-Processor system that may come along one day.
- Q. Will it be able to play Amiga games?
- A. Games, games and more games. Basically, if the game

## Quote of the Month

We have nothing against ideas. We're against people spreading them. …General Augusto Pinochet of Chile will run on an A1200 with 040/060 then it should work quite happily on the new card. Quake and Doom should fly on this system. Although the PC version would run at the same time if you wanted, by enabling two player mode on one machine via a direct TCP/IP link up! AGM

I f you are using your Amiga to connect to the Internet, you  are  probably  using Miami .  If  you  aren't,  you probably  ought  to  check  it  out.  It  can't  be  beat  for speed, features and ease of use. This month Miami has been upgraded to version 3.0a.  The  latest  version  adds  lots  of nice features including the ability to connect via a LAN. There are multiple files:

- MIAMI30A-GTL.LZX,
- MIAMI30A-020.LZX,
- MIAMI30A-MAIN.LZX,
- MIAMI30A-000.LZX, and
- MIAMI30A-MUI.LZX.

Need  to  kill  a  little  time?  If  you  enjoy  a  game  of Solitaire once in a while, I have just the ticket. Soliton is the best Solitaire game I have seen. It's MUI based, so it looks good. It has beautiful graphics and animated card turns so it plays well. You may already have this one in your collection, but this month we got an update to version 1.60b. It's

a beta version, but I've been using it without problems. The new version runs faster with smoother animation, and has several other improvements as well. Look for SOLITON160B.LZX.

There are two pictures this month that are well worth adding to your collection. PELICAN2.JPG is a beautiful picture  of  two  pelicans  in  flight.  PARROT10.JPG  is  a closeup  of  a  parrot  grooming  himself.  The  colors  are amazing.

Of course, we have the usual selection of datatypes:

- AKSVGDT43175.LZX for Superview pics
- AKPNGDT43175.LZX for PNG pics
- AKLJPGDT43175.LZX for lossless JPEG pics
- AKJFIFDT43175.LZX for JPEG pics

## February and March Meetings Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

February usually means cold weather which brings all sorts  of  problems to the area, but this year we got a big break.  I  actually  saw  some  trees  blossoming  out  on  the second day of the month! I wish I everything else could be this nice. News on the Amiga seems to be scarce, though there is plenty of news revolving around the Amiga. They keep  licensing  new  companies  to  the  Amiga.  They  announce new sales to keep things moving along. They just keep putting off any great news on what they are doing. Anticipation…

Our meeting for the month almost did not get to be. A small mix-up had us waiting for someone to decide our fate.  After a near miss we got underway. It was sort of a split meeting. We had a 1200 undergoing improvements at the back of the room, and a 4000 presenting the main show at  the  front.  David  Campbell  brought  his  4000  and  new scanner along to show that the Amiga can handle scanning just  fine.  Using  a  shareware  software  package  he  put  the scanner through its moves and it worked flawlessly. With the price of scanners falling rapidly, everyone seems to be trying their hand at digitizing. Some scanners have dropped below the $100 range, but if you want a good one, please look into the SCSI scanners. You will be glad you did.

The  other  part  of  our  meeting  revolved  around  a 1200. Fellow club member Okley Moss was having a hard time navigating the Internet, and asked me to take a look at it.  The  biggest  problem I  could  see  was  lack  of  memory, and  or  the  wrong  kind.  He  had  a  PCMCIA  memory expansion  card  plugged  in,  but  it  only  provides  16  bit memory so it is slow. After loading one page he was down to  23k  of  RAM  left.  Definitely  not  enough!  Later  while visiting  Commodore  Country,  I  came  across  a  memory expansion card for the 1200. It used one 72 pin SIMM and it had a math chip on it. It was just $40. I told Okley about the card and that I had an eight meg SIMM for $10. For $50 Okley improved his 1200, and now enjoys the Internet!

March 1998 seems to be out of step this year. Snow fell  for  the  first  time  this  winter. Though spring starts in March, it seems that winter suddenly woke up and realized it had nearly slept through its season. It gave us winter late, but it was the kind of winter I could live with more often. The biggest  news  I  saw  for  the  month  of  March  on  the

Amiga was the announcement that phase5 had upped the speed  of  the  CyberstormPPC  to  233MHz!  The  233MHz PowerPC shows performance equal to or greater than the 333MHz Pentium II now powering PCs! This little bit of news was enough to get me interested. I hope to have one in my hand very soon. More later after it happens. I have been without my computer for over two weeks as I type this. I sure miss it…

This  month's  meeting  had  us  redoing  a  previous meeting.  Last  year  we  attempted  to  give  a  printer  comparison,  but  failed  due  to  technical  problems.  This  year things went much better. We used Ned Kelly's 4000 with his  newly  installed  68060  accelerator,  just  acquired  from me, an Epson Color Stylus 800, an Epson Color Stylus 600, and a Hewlett Packard Deskjet 855. We also had two of the latest printer driver packages to compare. They were Studio II Professional and Turbo Print 6 . Our first test used the 800 and Studio II . Things went smoothly, but the printing was very slow. All sorts of reasons were pitched at the problem, as the printer slowly printed each small strip very slowly. Then it struck me! We had just installed the 68060 that day, and no adjustments had been made to the 4000. The caches in the 060 were off! Turning them on got a WOW as the printing sped up nicely. While it continued to print I made further adjustments that really got things going along fine.

We printed out some pictures on the three printers, using  the  two  packages.  Everyone  agreed  that  the  Epson was the winner, and each of the software packages had their advantages. Turbo Print is fast, but it was using most of the 060's  CPU  power  to  make  it  that  fast  -  nearly  98% sometimes. Studio II had an edge in print quality, but was slower, although it was using a third of the CPU's power. The HP had a disadvantage in the test. We were forced to use a lower resolution, due to HP not releasing its driver information for anything but Windows. I have seen the 800 series  HP  print  and  they  do  a  great  job,  but  the  Amiga cannot access the 600x300 resolution it offers. This means we were forced to compare its 300x300 resolution with the Epson's 1440x720. Which do you think will look better? Amiga  Inc.,  has  announced  that  Epson  will  work  with them to develop  drivers  for  the  Amiga,  giving  a  further reason to consider the Epson for Amiga users.

All in all, the meeting was a great success. You missed a truly enlightening meeting for the month of March!

For me the month has been one big WOW. Though I have  been  forced  to  live  without  my  computer  while waiting for a new CPU, it has been one big Amiga month. A couple of days  after  the  meeting  I  got  to take  my  first  airplane  ride… and  go  to  my  first  Amiga computer show in St.Louis the Gateway 98 Amiga show! That's another story…
