## Kickoff The Future With Amiga®

Amiga Inc.'s strategic direction and future plans include new software technology, system availability and Web site

L ondon, UK - May 15, 1998 - Amiga Inc., a pioneer  in  multimedia  development,  today announced  plans  to  provide  a  new  software architecture that will offer enhanced levels of performance  and  useability  for  the  Amiga  community. Amiga will develop and license software technology that  offers  leading  multimedia  solutions  for  the emerging digital convergence market.

'Amiga has the opportunity to move ahead of the industry  in  setting  standards  to  follow,'  said  Jeff Schindler,  general  manager  of  Amiga,  Inc.  'By working  closely  with  Amiga  developers  and  user groups, we will all have the opportunity to share in this exciting, emerging market.'

To build upon Amiga's legacy as a multimedia leader, the  company  announced  Amiga  OS  4.0  which  is slated to launch in November of '98. Amiga OS 4.0 will  have  a  new  user  interface  and  support  Amiga legacy software with an integrated emulator. Hardware  developers  are  already  working  on solutions  for  software  and  hardware  backward compatibility with the new Amiga architecture.

Amiga, Inc.  also  announced  plans  to  unveil  a  personal computer that is an industry standard architecture solution. The new system will provide a bridge to  the  next  generation  of  Amiga  technology.  The system  is  scheduled  for  availability  in  November with  a  suggested  retail  price  of  USD  $999.  These systems will be available through Amiga International.

Also available soon, Amiga Inc. will host www.amiga.com, the official web site for developer news, information, and relations. Amiga International's site, www.amiga.de, will continue to be  the  location  for  Amiga  distributors  and  legacy product sales and licensing.

## World of Amiga 1998

The Announcement - The Show - Opinion by Patrick Anderson (patrick@ourskool.demon.co.uk)

May 16-17, 1998 - This year's World of Amiga was very  eventful.  I  attended  the  announcement  on  Friday evening and then went to the show on Saturday. Last year, my show report fit into just a few paragraphs. This time I have  decided  to  break  it  into  several  sections:  The Announcement!, The Show, and My Opinion.

T he Announcement! (Friday Evening) The long wait is over! Amiga Inc finally made their big announcement Friday evening. As we waited for the  'show'  to  begin,  most  people  in  the  crowd  were buzzing with excitement. There were a lot of jokes about the  announcement  being  delayed  yet  again.  At  first,  it looked as if the room might be pretty empty for the announcement, but it was nearly full by the time things started.

-  Affordability!
-  High performance multimedia
-  Open architecture
-  Evolves - No buying a system only to be outdated in 6 months
-  FUN - An Amiga has to be fun!!!

rewarded.  He then introduced several members of the Amiga team. Jeff explained that there were at least 15 different business plans put  together  before  this  final  one  was  approved  by Gateway. It was approved about two weeks ago, and Jeff said he has hardly slept since. In fact, he was up until 2AM on Thursday night trying to work out some key decisions. Unfortunately,  a  big  part  of  the  future  rests  on  some  of these decisions. Amiga Inc. does not want to rush things, and therefore decided to cut 1/3 of their scheduled presentation.  Jeff  said  they  were  very  close  to  some  deals  and decisions,  but  did  not  want  to  jeopardize  anything  by speaking too early. Amiga Inc. hopes to have the other 1/3 of the presentation within the next 30 days.

Finally,  Petro  made  his way  to  the  podium.  He made a few introductory remarks  and  thanked the organizers of the World  of  Amiga. Then  he  introduced J e f f Schindler. Jeff started off by s a y i n g t h a t patience  would  be

After taking deep breath, Jeff started the presentation (which was done on a PC using PowerPoint - a couple of people yelled out 'Should have used Scala!'):

## Amiga in a Box

-  Patents - Amiga owns several key patents
-  Chipset - the custom chips gave the Amiga an early multimedia advantage

## Digital Convergene

-  Internet - connecting people and information
-  Digital media and entertainment - digital realism and expression of imagination
-  Electronic paradigm shift - digital appliances prolific

## Digital Convergence Market

-  Sub $500 computers
-  Set top boxes
-  Internet appliances
-  Portables
-  Game consoles
-  TV/PC
-  Tower computers

Who owns this market? NO ONE!!!

## Revolutionary Architecture

-  Multimedia processor 5 to 10x today's PC Screaming 3D / 400 million pixels per second 3 or 4 MPEG streams

-  High speed Internet
-  Sub $500 computer solution Lower cost for digital appliances
-  Breakaway OS technology
-  Convergence ware

## Carl Sassenrath on the New Amiga

Carl  really  was  amazed.  He  couldn't  believe  the performance that the new Amiga was going to have. He is excited that the Amiga will once again 'blow the socks off everything  else!'  Jeff  also  said  that  R.  J.  Mical  was  very excited, but the again, everything excites him.

## How do we get there?

-  Amiga Classic - OS3.1, AGA, 68K
-  Amiga Bridge - OS4.0, x86 (Developer system available November '98)
-  Digital Convergence - OS5.0, new architecture (Available end of '99)

The Bridge system could be available to the public if there is enough interest. It will have OS4.0 running on the x86,  with  Amiga  classic  support  through  Amiga  Forever and the Siamese V4.

## Building Blocks

-  Backward compatibility - emulation and Siamese
-  Cornerstone OS kernel may be replaced - expect a decision in the next 30 days
-  Revolutionary architecture in development
-  Amiga developers support as well as other developers
-  Developer kits will be available as soon as possible and the Bridge systems will be ready this year

## Wrap up

Jeff  then  introduced  Allan  Havemose,  Ph.D.,  who will head the software development for Amiga Inc. Then Jeff  explained  that  the  possible  new  core  for  Amiga  OS could be JavaOS, Linux, or an embedded system. Amiga Inc. has also decided that OS3.5 was not worth the effort. Most people have already updated their OS, and developing OS3.5 would only delay their plans. AmigaOS 5 will be dependent  upon  a  new  revolutionary  chip  that  they  are unable to discuss at  the  present  (but  it's  not  Intel!).  The decision to use the x86 architecture as the Amiga Bridge was due to several factors. First, the development tools for the 'magic' processor are available on x86, but would need porting  to  PowerPC.  Also,  they  will  be  able  to  take advantage  of  Gateway's  alliances  to  have  cheap  development  machines.  Amiga  OS  5  will  have  support  for  the Amiga Classic.

T he Show! Brian Donahue and I arrived at about 40 minutes prior to the show. People already started lining up to  get  in  and  by  the  time  the  doors  opened  a  couple  of hundred of people were waiting. Since we already bought our tickets, we were able to just walk in.

When we got in we stopped for a moment to decide where to go first. At that moment, the power went out. I guess all the exibitors must have turned on their systems at the same time. The outage only lasted about 3 minutes, but it was funny to watch everyone in the dark. As soon as the lights went out, people got there lighters out and were still trying to check out the bargains at the many stands.

And there were a lot of good deals to be had. It seems that most vendors learned their lesson from last year when many sold out of popular games and hardware. Of course, the  most  sought  after  items  were  Quake  and  Genetic Species. Both were impressive… very impressive. Brian had trouble  deciding  which  to  buy,  but  finally  settled  on Quake.

The Amiga booth was crowded with people trying to find out the big Amiga news. Darrick Lisle spent the whole day fielding questions and explaining Amiga's plans. Petro was doing what he does best: Talking to users and promoting the Amiga. He was signing anything that you asked him to sign. A lot of people bought the new Amiga Theme CD and had Petro sign that. Amiga was also giving out Amiga stickers, boing ball metal stickers, and mouse pads. They also hosted an Internet connection for an IRC chat, Haage &amp; Partner's demo of EasyWriter, Active's NetConnect, a Genetic Species demo, and more.

Another  popular  booth  was  Siamese's.  Steve  Jones was showing off Siamese and rallying Amiga users behind the Bridge solution. He is really optimistic about the future of the Siamese. He stated that his primary goal isn't current Amiga owners, but ex-Amiga users, Mac to PC transitioning people, and PC owners with VideoToaster needs. He wants to get people introduced to the Amiga by using the 'stealth' approach. Get them to buy the card to allow them to  run  Mac  software  or  the  Toaster.  Then,  in  6  months when he updates the software, let the Siamese say, 'Oh, by the  way,  I'm  an  Amiga…  Don't  you  just  love  me!'  The Siamese V4 looks impressive, will introduce many people to the Amiga, and will be the fastest Amiga ever. As Steve said, don't think of it as an Amiga stuck in a PC. Think of it as an Amiga with a 200Mhz co-processor with free video drivers for all the newest video cards. I.E. the PC is just a slave  to  the  Amiga  card!  I  was  impressed,  and  I  put  a deposit on one of the cards.

CU-Amiga and Amiga Format were there selling a ton of magazines. In CU's booth, they had Quake running. They also  hosted  White  Knight  and  Wolf  Dietrich  from phase5.  Wolf  was  demostrating  the  super  Cybervision board and a PowerUp board. There was a lot of interest in what phase5 had to say after the big announcement from

Amiga Inc. Lets just say they weren't too happy. Amiga Inc.  did  say  they  were  willing  to  talk  to  Phase5  if  they wanted to also make a Bridge system.

Epic  Marketing  tempted  me  with  Elastic  Dreams. This  relatively  low  cost  image  manipulation  program  is very PowerGoo on the Mac. It looks like a lot of fun, but I could think of a real reason to use it.

Another show highlight was the Amiga Theme Song. Annex performed a song and dance routine with the Amiga created  music  pumping  in  the  background.  Everbody seemed to like the German techno music. It may not be a

Top  40  hit,  but  how many other computers have  their  own  song? (P.S.  To  here  a  sample of the song, goto Annex's page!)

Holger Kruse was awarded the AAA award for his contribution to  the  Amiga scene. His Miami TCP/IP stack has enabled  thousands  of Amiga  users  to  easily

M y Opinion Hearing the BIG news from Amiga Inc. was very confusing.  I  went  through  a  lot  of  emotions thinking about: optimism, anger, sadness, glee, disappointment…  But  now,  I  have  had  time  to  think  everything through and I have decided this is the best thing for the Amiga.

I  was  hoping  that  Amiga  would  announce  a  new computer that would compete with the latest PowerMacs and  PeeCees.  But  instead,  they  have  gone  beyond  that. They are shooting for a new revolution. They must have

I was hoping that Amiga would announce a new computer that would compete with the latest PowerMacs and PeeCees. But instead, they have gone beyond that. They are shooting for a new revolution access  the  Internet.  It  looks  like  might  have  renewed competition from Genesis, the updated version of AmiTCP from Active.

AmigaSoc organized a series of conferences throughout the show. The only one that I attended was the one on Java. I was hoping to hear that Java would be available in a month or so. Jeroen Vermeulen, who is working on Merapi for Haage &amp; Partner, was there to explain what is taking so long. He said that he basically didn't want to do a quick port a JavaVM, but he wanted it to be able to take advantage of the Amiga's key features. One example is that most JavaVM are very memory greedy. He wanted to eliminate this from an Amiga JavaVM. He is not trying to make any proprietary changes to his Java implementation. It will be based  on  Sun's  standard.  When  someone  asked  about whether Microsoft's version of Java would influence him, he stated that it appears to him that Microsoft's version is illegal.  (He  also  said  'screw  Microsoft,'  bringing  a  loud round of applause. Jeroen is working very hard on Java and has  submitted  many  corrections  to  Sun  regarding  their JavaVM specifications  (and  most  were  accepted  by  Sun.) Java  is  still  a  while  away,  but  it  will  be  worth  the  wait. Overall, the crowd was disappointed, but very understanding. Jeroen seems to be doing a thorough job of implementing Amiga Java.

Other  than  that,  their  was  just  a  ton  of  people shopping and gawking. I could write more, but it was so overwhelming,  I  have  trouble  remembering  everything  I saw. I can't wait until Computer '98 in Cologne !

seen Apple's think different  ads!  Instead of  competing  in  the cut  throat  computer market they are going to go with an acrhitecture  that  out  perfoms them while at the same time  being  affordable and highly scalable.

Amiga OS 5 looks to be a revolution in computing.  A  super OS and a s u p e r

'mystery' chip. I'm glad they didn't try to target what is available now. I'm looking forward to the day when I can buy an Amiga phone, TV, computer, portable, etc. All of these will be available if Amiga is successful.

A lot of people are very disappointed that the interim solution  is  based  on  x86  systems.  Remember,  it  is  only temporary! X86 happens to be the platform that required development tools are on. It would just delay things to port them to PowerPC and then start work on Amiga OS 5. We are  in  hurry…  aren't  we?  And  with  the  Siamese  inside, you'll still have a screaming Amiga.

I look at it this way. Gateway could have said 'Screw you,' and just abandoned the Amiga and started working on  'NEW' OS for this  new  chip.  But  instead,  they  are trying to involve the Amiga community in this revolution. We have the opportunity to be a part of a paradigm shift. To do that, we may have to use an x86 for a year. In the end, it will be worth it.

Our only choices are:

a) Give up(and buy a PC or Mac?)

b) keep our old Amigas as they are and shutup about the lack of Java, H/W, ICQ, Real Audio, etc., or c) do our best to help Amiga Inc. reach their goals and be the first to reap the benefits of this revolution.

I'm choosing option C. It will be a fun ride, and I'm looking  forward  to  the  new  millenium  now  more  than ever!!!! AGM

## The Announcement

by David McKergan (Dave@dmckergan.force.co.uk) &amp; Mark Logan (Logan-M2@ulst.ac.uk)

T his was thrown together (very quickly) to try and make  some  details  of  WOA  98  available.  The following information is to be regarded as NONOFFICIAL ie; not a press release. All version numbers are to be regarded as 'working titles.'

This information was gleaned purely from exhibitors including Wolf Dietrich, Darreck Lisle and Joe Torre. (The 'Boing' shoes were the first thing I saw.)

Ok - important points first, followed by details…

There will be NO AmigaOS Version 3.5 release We will  instead  be  going  straight  to  AmigaOS  4.0. Darreck  stated  that  Amiga  Inc.  did  not  want  to  release something  that  would  be  regarded  as  a  minor  update  in comparison.  Instead,  something  wonderful  is  about  to happen. Ok - let's see your reaction to the next point.

AmigaOS 4.0 will be for INTEL platforms No joke - This is part of the overall plan to start development for the 'Wow' machine to be released later in 1999.  The  reason  for  the  temporary  jump  to  the  Intel platform?  The  jump will be made to enable the  gradual  development  of  software  for OS  Version  5.0.  In order t o r e t a i n compatibility with legacy software,  the OS  4.0  systems  will simply  be  using  the Index 'Inside Out' by Siamese  Systems.  So why  don't  we  just develop using our

AmigaOS Version 5.0 release AmigaOS Version 5.0 will be back on Amiga! (I didn't know how to phrase that; whatever a new Amiga will be!)

'The Chip': It's a processor Jim, but not as we know it! One of the strangest things was that they referred to 'the chip' as 'not being a processor.' Apparently, the chip can  emulate  other  processors  -  ie;  given  an  entirely different instruction set. (We were told it has x86 emulation - we're not sure about PPC, but it definitely doesn't have 68K emulation).

So what's this miracle chip? No-one would say. It was simply  referred  to  as  'the  chip.'  Everyone  was  under NDA. The new machine was also referred to as the 'Wow machine' - simply because of everyone's reaction. Fleecy Moss mentioned that he had just bought a Voodoo 2 based gfx card for his, and thought it was pretty good - until he saw  'the  chip'  in  action.  He  said  that  'at  times,  it  was difficult  to  tell  the  difference  between  the  real  and  computer generated action.' (My interpretation - DMcK) Somebody asked if they had exclusive rights to 'the

The prototype is capable of handling 400 MILLION textured / blended / fogged / whatevered pixels per second. Darreck mentioned that it can handle (decode) 4 simultaneous High Definition Television data streams coming in at once and it wouldn't even 'make a dent in the processor.'

Amiga's?  Answer:  Because  we'll  be  using  a  new  modern multimedia-based  OS  kernel  which  runs  on  an  Intel platform, which the Amiga platform doesn't have development tools for… Sound familiar?

Darreck  Lisle  couldn't  reveal  which  kernel  will  be used (and intended to be shown at WOA98) due to something 'not being signed properly,' however it is known that they  considered  Linux,  Java  and  BeOS.  Joe  Torre  also mentioned BeOS at least twice in relation to incremental development  of  the  kernel.  As  usual,  nothing  was  given away but I (personally) think it's BeOS. (They also had a quote from Jean-Louis Gassee on one of their press releases. Don't blame me if I'm wrong though!

as a keyboard controller.'

'... it made Carl Sassenrath drool'

Some  unofficial  specs:  The  prototype  is  capable  of handling  400  MILLION  textured  /  blended  /  fogged  / whatevered pixels per second. Darreck mentioned that it can  handle  (decode)  4  simultaneous  High  Definition Television data streams coming in at once and it wouldn't even 'make a dent in the processor.' Impressive.

…and  this  was  on  the  patched,  thrown  together version  of  the  chip.  Joe  mentioned  a  tenfold  increase  in power  after  optimization,  however  I  suspect  this  was exaggeration used for emphasis of the processing power.

Every time this new machine was mentioned, phrases such as 'Mind blowing' were very much in evidence. To chip'  -  they  don't, but Joe Torre said that one  of  the  advantages of  having  Gateway  as their  parent  company was  that  they  knew Intel's plans three years in advance! Another question was why this chip couldn't just be put onto a PCI card;  Joe  replied  with a comparison of 'Having  a  PentiumII

Does this answer your questions

PPC?" asked Wolf Detrich. It

(unofficially) quote Darreck Lisle… 'This new machine will be released at a price of $500. It'll blow everything away.' (And  yes,  that  was  dollars).  When  talking  to  Darreck, everyone got the impression that there was going to be a radical  step  forward  in  computing.  This  was  later  confirmed by Joe Torre at the Amiga Hardware seminar later in the day.

Their plans for the new Amiga are… ermmm… uhh WOW!

Oh yeah… there was an Amiga show too!

phase 5 gave a demonstration  of their  new CyberVisionPPC.  Don't know Cyberstorm specs but it was playing three mepgs and running Benoit concurrently and prefectly smoothly.  'Does this answer your questions about  multi-tasking  under  PPC?'  asked  Wolf  Detrich.  It did.

Ateo concepts were there with their Pixel64 and Ateo Bus  expansions.  Nice  low  cost  solutions  which  looked great.

Paul Nolan gave an extremely impressive demonstration of Photogenics NG. It was a pre-alpha version but the finished  product  is  due  to  be  released  in  the  coming months. Price: about 100.

Some Dutch guy working for Haage &amp; Partner (sorry, I didn't get your name) gave an overview of their 'Merapi' project  -  development  is  slow  so  it'll  be  sometime  yet before we see it. Haage &amp; Partner, give this guy a hand hire some more people!

Thanks to…

Amiga Incorporated - For paying for  the  hire of the seminar hall over the two  days,  entrance  was hence free.

Darreck  Lisle  -  For answering  the  same  ques- tions over and over and over and…

Annex - For putting on a great show - I love my new CD!

Petro - For signing loads of stuff and being an allround nice guy.

The guy giving  out  the  'Amiga'  and  'Powered  by Amiga' stickers. (Didn't get your name - sorry!)

Wolf Dietrich - For the CybervisionPPC demo, and for making WarpOS look slow.

Everyone else - For turning up and supporting the Amiga. AGM

## phase 5 and Haage &amp; Partner announce cooperative effort They promise continued support for the PowerPC integration

M ay 18, 1998: In a joint  anouncement  after  the recent World of Amiga show in London, and as a reaction  to  the  plans  revealed  by  Amiga  Inc., Haage &amp; Partner and phase 5 digital products have emphasized  their  full  and  continued  support  for  the  PowerPC integration.  With joint efforts,  both  vendors  will  further support the developers and the users of PowerPC technology, and will ensure a fast growing number of stunning and powerful applications. With many thousands of PowerUP boards beeing shipped so far, a number of installed systems which  is  rapidly  growing,  the  PowerUP  boards  already provide an attractive market for all developers. This fact is underscored  by  many  upcoming  PowerUP  releases  of major Amiga software packages, and the increasing support of software vendors which has been agreed on during the WoA even after the announcements of Amiga Inc.

Haage &amp; Partner and phase 5 digital products emphasized  that  the  competition  of  their  different  approaches towards PowerPC integration, as well as the public dispute about this, are a matter of the past. 'We will ensure that users of PowerUP system have a transparent integration of their PowerPC software, and will see a rich variety of most powerful  applications  to  be  released  soon'  say  representatives  of  both  companies.  Further  development  of PowerPC system software shall be done with close consul- tations between the companies; beside that, cooperations in the  development  of  powerful  PowerPC-based  system libraries and other OS extensions are being discussed.

In meetings of the managements of Haage &amp; Partner and phase 5 digital products with Amiga Inc. already during the WoA show in London, it has been agreed that a new proposal will be presented to Amiga Inc. which outlines an alternative  option  to  'Amiga  Bridge'  system  planned  by Amiga Inc.

This  alternative  is  a  new  PowerPC-based  system, which will feature the planned Amiga OS upgrade and can be out for sale in the retail channels by end of the year. Beyond incorporating standard industry components and interfaces,  such  a  system  can  provide  additional  options which allow for creative development and expansion in the spirit of the Amiga and can also run the current and next releases of AmigaOS.

Based on the PowerPC, this system will also provide continuity and innovation for all users and developers, and will  allow  the  Amiga  community  to  take  part  of  such stunning  developments  such  as  Motorola's  new  AltiVec technology,  an  extension  to  the  G4  PowerPC  processors which  will  provide  a  breathtaking  performance  already early next year. With approval and support of Amiga Inc., this  technology can introduce the long-awaited revival of

the Amiga platform already this year, quickly providing a growing market of powerful systems  which users can buy,  and  for which developers can develop  and  sell  software and add-ons.

Haage &amp; Partner and phase 5 digital products also encourage all Amiga developers  who  want  to participate today in an existing innovation, and who want to be a part of an Amiga market which provides growth, continuity and innovation from  now  on  and  during the next years, to speak out now  and  commit  themselves to support the PowerPC  as  the  heart  of the next generation of Amiga systems.

I have been using ARQ in my system for a number of years now to improve the look of the system requesters. It has worked well for me, but it's been a long time since the last  upgrade;  and  in  this  age  when  many  people  (if  not most)  run  their  Workbench  in  256  colors  or  greater,  it could use a little spicing up. Well, MRQ (MRQ.LZX) to the rescue. It patches your requesters like ARQ does, but it's MUI based and it supports the use of multiple colors. You can even supply your own artwork (in the form of brushes) that the program will use rather than the standard brushes that come with the package. Anyway, it looks great! Check it out.

I started this article with a repeat from April. I'll end the  same  way.  This  month  we  have  still  more  datatype updates:

## CyberStorm

## A review of phase5's Cyberstorm MKIII accelerator by Fabian Jimenez of the National Capital Amiga Users Group

W ell, I finally did it! I broke down and bought a Phase  5  CyberStorm  MKIII  accelerator  from National Amiga. I was darn lucky too. It was the last one Greg Scott had in stock! The CyberStorm MKIII features  the  Motorola  68060  CPU clocked at 50 MHz, 4 SIMM sockets, and an Ultra-Wide SCSI controller.

The CyberStorm MKIII came in an unmarked black box. Remembering the box I saw the CyberVision 64/3D in, this seems to be a common motif with Phase5. Inside was  the  card,  a  manual,  installation  software,  and  some spacers for Amiga 4000T installation. The manual was both in German and English, and had clearly pictured illustrations  on  how to install  the  card  as  well  as  terminate  the onboard  SCSI  controller.  Unlike  the  3640  040  card  the CyberStorm is replacing, the 060 CPU did not require any heat  sink  or  fan  cooling  device  to  be  mounted  to  it. Impressive!

The first thing you are told to do is install the modified AmigaOS libraries from the provided floppy. After this is done, you can then power down your machine and begin to take it apart. Having a 4000 desktop, I had to remove the front face plate as well as the floppy drive bay assembly to gain access to the CPU portion of the 4000's motherboard. Removing  the  3640  and  placing  the  CyberStorm  is  was fairly easy, after checking one jumper on the motherboard. I  placed two 16 meg SIMMs into the first bank of SIMM sockets. The CyberStorm MKIII does require you to buy memory chips in pairs.

Pretty confident that everything had gone well up to now, I reassembled my 4000 and turned it on. The machine turned on and booted fairly quickly. Opening and closing windows on the Workbench were noticeably faster, as well as running common applications. I tested everything from Multiview, Final Writer, Ibrowse, Ppaint and ImageMaster. It  was  amazing  to  see  how  responsive  the  machine  was. Most  noticeable  was  the  increased  responsiveness  from CPU intensive games like Doom, Descent, and the Quake Demo. Even my ShapeShifter worked without a hitch and seemed as speedy as a low end PowerMac.

Running unscientific speed tests, my 040 4000 jumped from  25  MIPS  (Meaningless  Information  Provided  by Salespeople) to a whopping 125 MIPS under the 060 CPU. Also the transfer rate on my 4000's IDE controller went from 1.7 megs/second to 2.7 megs/second after installing the card. I was able to run Miami TCP, Ibrowse, AmIRC, and  play  an  MPEG-audio  file  at  high  quality  with  no significant drain on my 4000's multitasking.

My only complaint about the CyberStorm MKIII was the  decision  by  Phase5  to  install  an  Ultra-Wide  SCSI controller.  It  may  be  a  little  bit  of  overkill  to  have  40

megs/second transfer rate for my Amiga. I know this was done  since  the  MKIII  is  based  on  their  PPC  PowerUP design where such a controller would be more logical, but have you priced Ultra-Wide SCSI drives and cables? Maybe one day I will save up the $90 I will need to buy the cable, terminators, and adapters to use my older SCSI devices. I don't know when I will be able to afford those Ultra-Wide hard drives! The cheapest one I found was a 4 gig drive for $450.

In the end, if you can upgrade your Amiga to an 060 CPU I would highly recommend you get the CyberStorm MKIII from Phase 5. I have heard of problems people have had with other 060 accelerators, especially the ones made by Apollo. The 060 gives your Amiga the power it needs to run  some  fairly  CPU-intensive  applications.  Even  if  you don't  render  files  in  Lightwave,  web  browsing  is  100% better with this CPU. AGM

## The April &amp; May Amiga by the Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens Amiga By-The-Loop Meetings Johnny C. Kitchens

April usually means a time of transition for a number of  things.  The  weather  usually  makes  a  change  toward warmer temperatures. This year due to El Nino we seemed to stay about the same. The same can be said for the Amiga. Lots of talk, but not much action from Gateway. By the time you read this, the announcement that points to the future for the Amiga will have already been made. It has already begun to shake everything up that has to do with the  Amiga.  Early  reports  sounded  terrible,  but  more reliable reports begin to sound lots better! A complete redo of the Amiga! More later, I am sure. The April meeting kicked off with the announcement that  we  had  2  2000's  for  sale  in  the  club.  These  are donations to the club and the money will be put to good use. We had an announcement that appeared in the paper that Gateway was moving headquarters to California. This was followed with talk of Gateway releasing 3.5 OS in the third quarter. The big announcement of May killed that. We next had a discussion of the differences of 3.0 and 3.1. All I can say is get 3.1. Our glorious leader Ned Kelly told us  that  he  had  acquired  a  CD-R  and  MasterISO  2.0,  and would attempt to demo that for us next month, May. We next  covered  the  Siamese  system  and  its  various  configurations. Talk on MetCom followed, and will we have one this year. We will decide in May! A final question on the sizes of GVP memory modules came up. Hopefully we cleared that up. Our main presentation was a video presentation made by Mark Stodola of the recent Gateway '98 Amiga show held in St. Louis, which I was lucky enough to attend. Even though I was there, seeing the video certainly brought back memories of the excitement. May certainly  was  worth  looking  forward  to.  The rumor that Gateway would make a big announcement and show off what they were planning was truly exciting. First good news since ESCOM showed off their failed attempt at a  new  Amiga.  Gateway  did  make  a  big  announcement, which  brought  about  mixed  feelings  everywhere.  3.5  is dead, a developers machine in November referred to as the November machine, a 4.0 OS that will only work on the November machine, and a new Amiga with 5.0 OS in 1999.

The new Amiga, referred to as Amiga II, will feature as of yet unnamed super CPU that will speed up the Amiga to speeds beyond any Pentium. I have to say, this is the kind of news the Amiga community has been waiting for since 1994. Like the news or hate it, we need a direction, and hopefully we have got it. If Gateway pulls this off, we will have one heck of a machine to get our hands on, just like in 1985. Our  meeting  of  May  started  with  talk  of  the  big announcement, and as you can see we got one. We next announced our plans for MetCom as they stand for now. We will have a show similar to the one last year, with a club from Austin attending this time. Make your plans and be ready to come. Our first question of the night concerned the  setup  of  the  keys  for  Miami.  While  they  may  seem complicated,  their  setup  really  is  quite  simple.  Hope  we cleared it up for him. Another member brought along his system, and needed help getting it set up so that it could boot from the hard drive. We fixed that easily enough. We had a question on getting 3.1 ROMs for the 500. As I have said before, get 3.1! Finally a question on MIDI and SCSI for  the  Amiga  was  brought  up.  No  they  are  not  dirty words. Finally, Ned Kelly, as promised last month, brought along  his  4000  with  CD-R  and  MasterISO  and  went through  the  steps  of  showing  how  easily  an  Amiga  can burn  a  CD-ROM.  It  is  amazing  that  any  computer  can easily create a CD today. Doing so gives you great access to a large number of computers, as CD-ROMs have become a necessity due to most software coming in that format. With 650 MB of storage, truly huge software programs can be put into a very convenient package, or a large amount of

data can be archived. The next step… DVD.

## Joke of the Month

The son telephoned his mother and asked, 'What did you think of the bird I sent you?'

~

Mom: 'Well, It had a kind of gamey taste.'

~

Son: 'You cooked it??!! Oh no. That was a rare South American parrot. It spoke 5 languages!'

~

Mom: 'Then it should have said something.'
