## Fleamarket Extravaganza The Report

One of the main goals of this year's Extravaganza was to bring user groups in the region together. We were successful!  Members  from  the  Central  Texas  Amiga Computing Society (CTAS), the Tulsa Amiga Group (TAG), and the X-otic Computer Systems of San Antonio (XCSSA) were present. Amiga enthusiasts from Houston, College Station and other Texas and Oklahoma locales were also in attendance.

There were many things to see and do at this year's show. While it was unfortunate that we were unable to hold any regular scheduled classes, we did have a presentation of ARexx. Donald Kassebaum from CTAS gave the demo on ARexx. Donald has done some programming on commercial  software  packages.  In  fact,  someone  pointed  out  a program in the flea market called Toaster Vision which was 'written by…Donald Kassebaum…'. I would like to thank  Donald  for  giving  his  time  to  present  a  well received class on such short notice.

Some of our members brought their computers to display some  of  the  newest  Amiga  hardware  and  software available.  Johnny  Kitchens  showed  off  his  A3000 powered by a 233 MHz Cyberstorm Power PC card and a Delfina  sound  card.  He  displayed  some  of  the  most current PPC software, including a beta version of Doom which  had  to  be  seen  to  be  believed!  Our  future President,  Wayne  Brodnax,  had  his  newly  transplanted 1200 motherboard installed in a huge tower case. Wayne had the cavernous tower case opened up and was kind enough to explain his new set up to all interested. Our current President and Librarian, Ned Kelly, had his A4000 up and running answering questions on his Delfina Lite sound card and his CD-R drive and Master ISO software. David Owens had his A3000 up and running with some games and answering anyone's questions. I had my Warp 040/40 powered A3000 running Quake, Amiga Forever and several other programs for all to see.

This year we had two dealers at the show. On-Video was unable to attend the show, but they did have  many items in  the  Flea  Market.  Once  again  Commodore  Country attended  the  show,  showing  their  strong  continued support for the Amiga. Tsunami Graphics and the Tulsa Amiga Group shared a set of tables, while selling hardware  and  software.  Both  groups  appeared  to  have  a steady flow of customers.

Door  prizes  were  graciously  supplied  by  Commodore Country, club members and there was even a generous donation by a non-member. In fact there were so many door prizes that at the last drawing everyone went away with at least one door prize!

I  would  like  to  thank  everyone  else  that  helped  at  the Extravaganza, many whom helped in more than one area (if I miss any one I am sorry). Okley Moss and Bill Raecke ran  the  registration  table  and  gave  out  those  lucky winning  tickets.  Ned  Kelly  handled  the  club's  Amiga software library. John Malmstrom helped throughout the day  with  everything.  Alexander  and  Catherine  Stodola, my children, sold drinks and snacks for the club. Most of all  I  would  personally like to thank my wonderful wife Genie for putting up with me and helping out the entire day.

And finally, remember, the Extravaganza is YOUR show. I welcome your comments or suggestions. Please feel free to contact me about this year's or next year's show.
