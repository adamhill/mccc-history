## Flea Market Extravaganza

In March I attended the Gateway '98 Amiga Show in St. Louis. I met Steve Folberg, the president of the Central Texas Amiga Computing Society, CTACS, of Austin. We discussed the possibility of holding an Amiga show for the benefit of all Texas Amiga users. Since the MCCC has held  an  annual  show  for  the  past  twelve  years,  it  was decided  that  our  club  would  have  the  Flea  Market Extravaganza and invite other Texas Amiga user groups to attend the show. This would hopefully be a starting point for future shows.

The Facts Date : Saturday October 10 Time : 12:00 PM until 4:00 PM Place: The Brookside Convention Center Cost : Free

Directions &amp; Parking The Brookside Convention Center is located at 1244 Brookside Drive in Hurst. To get to the Convention Center  get  to  Highway  183/121 and  take  the  Precinct  Line  Road exit  and  drive  south  on  Precinct Line Road. After approximately 0.3 miles  turn  left  (east),  on  Bedford Euless  Road.  Drive  0.4  miles  to Brookside  Drive.  The  Convention Center is on the southeast corner.

Classes This  year  we  hope  to  be  having classes,  but  we  need  your  help. Your  input  is  necessary  to  determine whether or not we will have any  classes  or  demonstrations  at the show.  Please contact our Educational  Chair,  David  Owens, or  myself  and  let  us  know  what

Dallas

Flea Market The flea market will be run the same as last year's. The flea market will be open to members for a fee of 5% on items sold. A fee of 10% will be charged to non-members on items sold. Spread the word to all your non-member Amiga friends, or former Amiga users. Flea market forms should be available at the July chapter meetings. Items will  be  collected  during  chapter  meetings  beginning  in August. If you can not attend a meeting, contact a designated collector. A list of collectors will be presented in the August newsletter.

Other Attractions Local dealers will be invited to attend the show. Since this is  a  Texas  show  we  will  invite  other  Texas  dealers  to attend. We will be having door prize drawings throughout the day. You need to be present to win. We are working on  obtaining  a  guest  speaker  for  the  event.  The  entire software  library  for  the  Amiga  will  be  available  to

type of classes you would attend. Also, if there are any volunteers out there that would like to teach a class, let us know.

members.  The  annual  special  on memberships will be offered: thirteen  months  for  the  price  of twelve. (This offer is good even if your  membership  is  unexpired). We  also  hope  to  have  a  few computers  set  up  so  you  can  ask the  club's  resident  gurus  for  help and advice.

Mark  your  calendar  for  Saturday, October  10,  and  dust  off  your unused  hardware  and  software. Spread  the  word,  save  up  your money  and  prepare  for  a  good time.  The  count  down  for  The MCCC  Flea  Market  Extravaganza '98 has begun!

P.S.  -  Your  help  is  necessary  to make the show a success. Please, if you  can  help,  let  me  know.  You can  call  me  at  metro  (972)  299-

6824,  or  leave  email  at  either  the  club  BBS  or  at mstodola@airmail.net.

## The Net Connection

This space used to be reserved to bring you my picks for the month of the best new files that were uploaded to the BBS. From now on, you can expect to see more on the AGM Web site (www.startext.com/np/agm/) than you see in  this  newsletter.  So,  rather  than  waste  space  here outlining the important files of the month, I'll outline the files  and  articles  that  have  been  made  available  at  the Web site. For you chapter secretaries, that means you can provide information each month instead of every other month. And I encourage everyone to submit articles. I'd like to see a lot of original information out there, not just a bunch of re-prints. Anything you'd like to submit can be sent  to  me  personally  at  wraecke@flash.net  or  to  the official club e-mail address at agm@startext.net.
