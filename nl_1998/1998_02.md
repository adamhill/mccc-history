## Removable Media

## A Look At History and What's There Now By Johnny C. Kitchens

R emovable media seems to have been a part of the computer since  the  very  beginning  of  computers. There just seems to be a need to transfer data, save it separately, or backup needed data in some way. Since the beginning,  all  sorts  of  removable  media  have  come  and gone. Punch cards were the early form to fill this need. It lacked an important feature in that it was not rewritable. Punch cards would have been a failure in the home market as  well  and  the  reader  is  big  and  noisy!  The  first  usable removable media has to be the tape drive. With the tape drive, we finally got a drive that is portable, rewritable, and economical.  Since  most  of  these  were  based  on  cheap cassette drives, and the cassette was already an established audio  medium,  cost  of  the  tape  drives  were  lower  than other  alternatives.  Tape  drives  have  slowly  evolved  into high  capacity  backup  devices,  moving  out  of  the  mainstream because of what they lacked… speed. While backing up a computer can be a 'start it and forget it' type of operation, random file access is another thing  altogether.  The  first  successful  removable  media, would have to be the 5.25 inch floppy. There were several size  variations,  but  the  5.25  inch  floppy  made  the  grade. This  format  has  dictated  the  future  of  removable  media ever since it came out. While it became the defacto standard and went through one upgrade after another, it was what it lacked that pointed the way for future formats. The disk and its housing are flexible and this did little to protect the media  from  damage  from  bending.  Protection  from contamination is minimal. Capacity peaked at 1.2MB and it still was not small enough to put in your pocket. The fact that the drives and disk are still offered today is proof that they were a success. What  followed  were  several  attempts  to  overcome these deficiencies. A miniature version of the 5.25 showed up, but failed to get rid of the flexible housing. A 3.5 and 3 inch hard shell floppy media showed up. These addressed just about everything 5.25 lacked. The hard-shell addressed the media flexing. A sliding cover addressed the dust and dirt  problem.  The  smaller  size  made  it  drop  right  into  a pocket. Improved density meant greater capacity and write protection was just a switch away! The 3.5 inch won this war. Their capacity has steadily increased with HD (High Density)  being  the  popular  peak.  A  2.88MB  ED  version was introduced a few years ago, but it did not catch on. A 10MB floptical version appeared that was compatible with existing  formats  (not  Amiga)  but  failed  to  catch  on  and faded away. While the HD 3.5 inch floppy has become a standard in the PC and Macintosh with its 1.44MB capacity, a lack of drives has kept it from being a standard, with its 1.76MB capacity, on the Amiga. A real shame. Since the development of the 3.5 inch floppy, other forms of removable media have come and gone. The first big winner in the market: SyQuest's 44MB and later 88MB drives. These offered huge capacity, compared to any floppy at  the  time,  and  speed  nearing  those  of  hard  drives.  One feature held them back, cost! I remember wanting one after seeing it in operation, but even used it was too expensive. SyQuest  steadily  increased  capacity,  but  the  price  never seemed to come down. Nevertheless, it continued to be a success and, as we will see, an inspiration. While the floppies and SyQuest were busily getting things sorted out, another format came seemingly out of nowhere. The CD-ROM seemed like the perfect format to the industry, but less so to the public. The same argument that held the Laser Disc and the audio CD back was being used to argue against the CD-ROM. You cannot make your own! The audio CD survived due to superior audio performance. The one thing CD-ROM had going for it, capacity, would be its savior. Programs were getting bigger, and the cost  of  putting  them  on  floppies  was  detrimental  to  user pocket books... plus the time of swapping all of those disks. The CD-ROM's capacity of 650MB and the development of faster  drives  worked together to insure the acceptance of

the format. Speed actually became a bigger complaint than

being able to write one. They seemed to be slower than floppies  in  the  early  days.  Then  the  speed  wars  started… each  manufacturer  claiming  faster  and  faster  drives. Designating speed increases with rating of how fast they were versus the original speed, the 2X being twice as fast as the original. Today they are up to 32X. Most of these are only their rated speed during a small portion of the time. Most seem to be only equivalent to 8X. I tested one 24X that ran the rated speed for a short time, then dropped to around 8.9X for a very long time. Finally it dropped to around 4X. The average for the whole run turned out to be 8.2X.

A  variation  of  CD-ROM killed  another  complaint.  CD-R gives your average user the ability to  create  their  own  CDs!  The advantage  of  that  becomes  even more  apparent  with  the  huge acceptance of the CD-ROM. After creating  a  CD,  you  can  put  it  in just  about  every  computer  being sold  today.  A  drawback  -  once

The most recent surge in removable media popularity and developments comes on the heels of the IOmega Zip drive. The Zip drive offered reasonable amounts of storage at a low price, and it looked like the next thing in storage. Its popularity spurred manufacturers to include the drive in their  computers.  Still  other  companies  licensed  the  technologies  to  make  their  own  version.  Competition  was bound  to  come  out  after  this  kind  of  success.  IOmega followed  the  100MB  Zip  with  a  1GB  Jaz  drive.  IOmega seemed to be in control of the removable market. SyQuest sent  forth  two  challengers  to  the  Zip.  Neither  of  these seemed to make a dent in the IOmega market. IOmega's

To increase disk capacity even further, a new format, DVD has made an appearance. It starts out at 4.7GB with promises of increased capacity these  disks  are  written,  that's  it…  you  cannot  change  it. Worse  yet,  make  a  mistake  and  you  wasted  time  and material.  The  drives  and  media  have  dropped  in  price nicely, increasing their popularity. A new development CDRW allows you to write to the disk as needed, as well as make changes, and correct errors. To increase disk capacity even further, a new format, DVD has made an appearance. It starts out at 4.7GB with promises of increased capacity, DVD-R, and DVD-RW are coming soon.

While all of this development was going on, another type  of  removable  seemed  to  be  making  its  way  out  of sight. Magneto Optical drives were on their way to making inroads  on  tape  backup  market.  Huge  capacity  with random  access  were  in  their  favor,  but  high  price  made them  out  of  reach  for  most.  They  were  also  slow.  The media for Magneto Optical boasted several advantages: long shelf life, and it could not be erased by a magnetic field! A breakthrough came about with the introduction of the 3.5 inch format. The disks are the size of two 3.5 inch floppies stacked. An initial capacity of 128MB packed a lot of data in a small space. The drives were a bit pricey, but the media seemed reasonable in comparison. The price of the drives and media have dropped steadily, while increasing capacity. The 3.5 format can be had in 128, 230, 540, and 610MB with the price of disk ranging from $4 to $50. Nothing else comes close in media price.

I  am sure that several companies must have noticed the need of users for a manageable, large capacity, and cost effective  means  of  storing  files,  hard  drive  backup,  and transferring  large  files  between  systems.  Taking  notice  of SyQuest's  dominance  of  the  removable  media  and  the inconvenience of tape backup, the right hardware could be a big success.

seemed  to  have  everything  right initially,  but  they  seem  to  falter on a follow through. The price of drives and media have yet to drop since introduction, and the Zip is still  100MB  despite  rumors  of  a 200MB version.

A drive called LS-120 has begun to enter the Zip drive domain. This drive is compatible with previous

3.5 inch floppies while offering 120MB on a special disk. Continuing  with  that  idea  comes  a  new  version  called HiFD.  It  works  like  the  LS-120,  but  offers  240MB  and speed similar to hard drives. Sony is behind this drive and many see it as the future of the floppy. Several companies have already announced support for the drive. This means little 'til we see the results.

Competition for the Jaz drive has come by way of SyQuest.  The  SyJet  is  SyQuest's  first  success  in  several failed  attempts  to  foil  IOmega…  offering  a  full  1.5GB capacity for less cost than the Jaz's 1GB. This has spurred SyQuest to introduce  the  SparQ  drive.  This  1  GB  drive costs  the  same  as  the  Zip  and  the  disks  cost  less.  They followed that with the announcement of a 4.7GB capacity drive…  the  same  capacity  as  the  DVD.  IOmega  has  not been totally idle. They have improved the Zip drive some and they now have a 2GB version of the Jaz. The Jaz, SyJet, CD, and DVD lack one thing. They cannot be carried in a shirt pocket, and it is recommended that they be carried in their containers to protect them as they are a bit fragile. The  Zip  disks  also  have  trouble  fitting  in  pockets. Backward  compatibility  is  another  problem  some  see  as plaguing removable media. Availability of the disk should be  the  main  worry!  Being  able  to  share  disks  is  another consideration. What do your friends have?

If you have a mountain of floppies that is increasing on a regular basis, and you need regular access to them, a removable  media  drive  could  save  you  lots  of  time  and money in the long run. Media with 100MB capacity could hold the equivalent of 70 HD floppies. Use compression and you could pack over 100 on it. Look at what 1GB of capacity could offer! You just have to decide on an internal or external version of your choice. Enjoy!!! AGM

## The Hombre

An Interview with Dr. Edward L. Helper Conducted by Vidar Langberget

m

V idar:  Could you tell us something about yourself, your education and your employment history, etc.? Dr. Hepler: I have a BS, MS, and PhD, all in Electrical  Engineering  and  all  from  Drexel  University  in Philadelphia, PA. I joined Bell Lab's after school and spent about 7 years in their Naperville, Ill. (Indian Hill) Facility. That facility was used to design all of the electronic switching systems for AT&amp;T (before it was split up) and the fault tolerant computers which drove them. I was involved in the design of the 3B20, 3B5 and 3B2 computers. A couple of them became commercial products of AT&amp;T after the split. I was also involved with the specification and design of part of the BellMAC-32, an early 32-bit microprocessor developed at Bell Labs.

From  Bell  Labs,  I  moved  on  to  General  Electric where I spent about 5 years. This was in their SpaceCraft Digital  Processor  department.  GE  made  communications satellites and we did processors of various types for them.

I next moved to Commodore where I worked on the AAA architecture and was responsible for the Andrea chip. Andrea was the Agnes/Alice equivalent for AAA. Andrea was  far  more  sophisticated  than  Agnes/Alice.  It  had  a microcoded  processor  (very  RISC  like)  built  in  to  do coordinate  arithmetic,  etc.  Much  of  the  line  draw  arith- metic, clipping, etc., was done in hardware on Andrea… The last couple of years, I reported to the VP of Engineering and was responsible for the architecture of next generation Amigas. In  that  role,  I  performed  various  studies including one which would have produced a single  chip  Amiga (Motorola MC680x0 core, plus AA logic), and early versions of Hombre which  contained  a  SIMD  processor  for graphics,  etc.  The  last  study  became  the Hombre and design was started.

I  now  have  my  own  company,  VLSI Concepts,  which  does  Architecture  (System and VLSI), design, and CAD work.

Vidar:  What  is  the  Hombre,  and  what was your involvement with it?

a CD interface, a peripheral interface, a bus interface and controllers for display and system memories. The second chip was the video data path and contained line buffers, a colour lookup table, etc.

The  chip  set  was  designed  so  that  with  minimal external chips (ROM, DRAM) a complete low-end system could be built. This low end system would be adequate for a game console like CD-32 (CD-64) or a set top box. With the addition of an ASIC (which connected to the peripheral interface),  a  low-end  computer  (like  the  A1200)  was produced.

When an external processor was added, the Hombre chip set became a peripheral processor and off-loaded the main processor so it could be more useful doing OS and user  tasks.  The  chip  set  could  also  be  configured  to  be 'slaves' on a peripheral card and therefore could become a graphics plug-in for any platform.

Internally, it had 64-bit datapaths. Externally, it could be configured to use 32-bit memory (in low cost (and lower performance)) configurations, or 64-bit memory in higher performance configurations. Both used the same chip, but bonded into different packages.

Vidar: What 3D features did it have?

Dr.  Hepler:  It  supported  Gourand  shading  and texture mapping in hardware. It could shade or map trapezoids… Pixel sizes ranged from 4bit to 24-bits.

It did most of the rendering steps in hardware and  supported  non-linear  shading  and  mapping…  One  of  the  software  engineers  did  a simulation of the texture mapping algorithm which  wrapped  an  angel-fish  picture  around the inside and outside of a rotating cylinder. It was pretty impressive and did the perspective mapping quite nicely.

Vidar: What kind of sound system did it have? Dr. Hepler: I planned on taking some of the sound circuitry  from  AAA to produce basic audio. But I planned on changing the output

![Image](1998_02_artifacts/image_000002_7f9003e9de46ad5c8900bd543ae843d98cef4990ec03bb5e5976f986d6ed61b6.png)

Dr. Hepler: Hombre was to be the next generation Amiga. I  did  the  architecture,  did  a  set  of  C-level  cyclecorrect models to perform performance simulations, then did  M  models  (a  Mentor  Graphics  proprietary  hardware description language) to synthesize the control logic. Other M models described the data paths and I had a couple of engineers starting to do transistor level design of them.

Hombre was to be a complete system in two chips. The first  chip  was  the  CPU  chip  and  contained  a  RISC integer core, a blitter, a 3D colour rendering engine, audio, format to that of digital CD (BCLK, LRCLK, DATA) to use commercially available amplifiers. There were two CD channels  in  and  a  method  of  combining  the  audio.  This allowed external audio chips (DSP style) to be placed on the peripheral  interface  and  be  merged  with  the  Hombre generated  audio.  It  also  allowed  audio  from  MPEG decoders to be merged with Hombre generated audio.

Vidar:  Would  the  Hombre  be  PAL/NTSC  compatible?

Dr. Hepler: Yes. We were also monitoring the movement of HDTV and were planning on making it as compat-

ible as possible. Of course, in hindsight, we would have had to make some changes as the HDTV standards still seem to be moving.

Vidar: Would features like the copper, scrolling and sprite support be included?

Dr. Hepler: Yes and no. A copper like structure was there. Scrolling was supported. I talked to enough people to realize that many game developers were unhappy with the sprite hardware. Most said that 8 sprites were not enough. Most also  said  that  the  collision  detection  hardware  was inadequate. No matter how many sprites I would have put in  hardware,  someone  would  have  wanted  at  least  one more.  So  I  put  in  no  sprite  hardware,  but  put  in  some blitter modes which made generating scenes with software sprites  very  easy.  There  was  really  only  one  hardware sprite, for a cursor.

Vidar:  What  resolutions  would  the  Hombre  offer? For games?

Dr. Hepler: It would go up to 1280 x 1024. Perhaps more interesting was that it supported 4 playfields (at lower resolutions)… And each playfield could be a different style of display. For example, one playfield could be HAM (for a very nice background) while others could use the colour lookup tables.

Vidar: How long do you think it would take to finish it?

Dr.  Hepler:  The  development  schedule  at  the  time was 18 months long for both hardware and software. We were  part-way  through  it  when  things  fell  apart.  The schedule was planned such that Hombre equipped gamesmachines  (CD-64)  would  have  been  available  for  the Christmas '95 season.

Vidar:  How  do  you  think  the  Hombre  would compare to the current consoles and 3D cards for the PC, not to mention AAA?

Dr. Hepler: I believe that it would have been competitive  with  any  of  the  game  consoles  currently  available. Some of the PC 3D graphics chips have probably pulled ahead, but they are targeting a different market. Other than the lack of compatibility with ECS and AA, it was superior to  AAA.  (We  had  decided  to  scrap  AAA  in  favour  of Hombre.)

Vidar: Many people are sceptical about custom chip sets,  because they say off-the-shelf stuff is faster, easier to upgrade and cheaper. What are your views on this issue?

Dr.  Hepler:  It  depends  a  lot  on  what  the  overall strategy is. You have to remember that all chips are custom chips,  whether  designed  by  'a  big  company'  or  a  little company. I think that a lot of the scepticism is due to a lack of  knowledge  of  how  chips  are  designed.  With  the  new synthesizers, etc., it is not nearly as difficult as it was even 5 years  ago.  Since  I  make  my  living  doing  these  kinds  of designs, I'm all for them.

Vidar: Is it possible to upgrade the Hombre, without designing a completely new chip?

Dr. Hepler: I had a specific set of products in mind for the Hombre. I would have to discuss product strategy before answering this sort of question.

Vidar: It seems like the rest of the computer world are moving towards programmable VLIW chips etc. What do you think about these, and would it be possible to integrate a chip like this into the Hombre to boost performance?

Dr. Hepler: Hombre had an integer PA-RISC core on board to act as the system processor in the low-end mode or as a peripheral processor in the high-end mode. I added a few instructions to it to help in graphics and 3D processing, much like the MMX instructions that Intel has added to the Pentium.

The VLIW work (like that of the MultiFlow) that I am aware of is still well off into the future at the chip level. I think that it would be premature to try to put something like that into Hombre. It probably would not fit into the cost window.

Vidar: What was the target price for the Hombre?

Dr. Hepler: I was targetting $45 (USD) for the two chips (total). This would have been our cost to produce.

Vidar: Would the PCI bus' bandwidth be a problem if it was put on a PCI card?

Dr. Hepler: No. The reason for this is that Hombre had its own processor and its own memory. The only thing passing through the PCI interface would have been commands or source data. All graphics fetches would have been from local memory. Most rendering would have also been from local memory.

Vidar:  If  Gateway  2000  asked  you  to  finish  the Hombre  and  provided  enough  resources,  would  you  be interested?

Dr.  Hepler:  I  have  tried  to  contact  them,  but  have been  unsuccessful  in  getting  to  talk  with  anyone.  I  now have my own company and have done some multi-media design  work  that  they  may  be  interested  in  licensing.  I would also be interested in doing some contract work in system or VLSI architecture.

Vidar: Thank you very much for taking the time to answer these questions!

## Non-Commercial Software Titles I Cannot Live Without By Johnny C. Kitchens

T he titles I am about to list here have made a useful or noticeable change or improvement to my system. Some of these are free - some need a small fee paid to get full benefit. If you have yet to try one or all, give them a shot. Then you can see why I like them.

1.  MCP - Master Control Program offers so many things  in  one  package,  it  is  hard  not  to  find  something useful in it. I remember when I first got my Amiga, I began getting  little  programs  that  offered  improvements  to various  ways  the  Amiga  worked.  Over  the  years  I  had collected quite a few of those. When MCP came along it replaced many of those. As it grew, it replaced more and more, 'til  it  has  just  about  replaced  all  of  them.  Do  not make the mistake of installing this and turning everything on. Try the different features out. Some may not work for you.  I  was  attracted  to  it  when  I  saw  it  moving  full windows around on the screen.
2.  MagicMenu  -  This  gives  the  Amiga  the  best looking menus you can see anywhere! It adds functionality to  the  menus. Best of all, you can adjust it to your own desire.
3.  Power  Snap  -  When  I  first  saw  Power  Snap,  I thought 'That is nice, but is it needed?' I was told once you use it, you cannot live without it. I installed it, but I did not use it. Then I tried it. Today I doubt if there is a single time that my computer is on that I do not use it. I have turned several people over to it, and they say the same thing. What it does is allow you to take text from one place and put it easily somewhere else. Get it, try it, and you will use it.
4.  SwazInfo - When I first saw this, I still was not sure what it did for me. It was easy to install and easy to uninstall… I figured I would try it. When I did an information  on  an  icon,  I  got  a  whole  new  interface.  All  the protection  bits  are  there,  I  can  set  icon  type,  stack  size, view the alternate icon, set the comment, and much more.
5.  MUI  -  Magic  User  Interface  came  to  me  by accident. I looked it over and misread what I thought it was supposed to do. Excited, I sent in my money to get a full working version. When I discovered it could not do what I wanted, I put it away and forgot about it. Then I got a piece of  software  that  needed  it.  Practically  every  time  I  turn around  there  is  something  new  requiring  it.  MUI  has simplified creating interfaces for programmers and they are using it. Class Act is very similar in what it does to MUI, so I  am including it here as well. A small war over which is better has erupted, but having both is almost a necessity.
6. Tools Daemon - This one gives you full use of the menubar, from the middle to the far right. Without it, that section of the menubar is just wasted space. You can add what you want to the menubar. That says it all.
7. MFR - Magic File Requester gives you the most powerful  and  complete  file  requester  you  can  have.  The only thing negative about it is that it has not been updated in a long time. Still, it is a part of my system and I use it.
8. File Archivers - Any file you download today is compressed  with  an  archiver.  Amiga  files  come  in  two forms  today,  Lha  and  LZX.  Lha  dominates  the  internet, while LZX has become our club's official format. Another one to consider is Zip. The PC world has settled on Zip and having it will give you access to those files.
9. MWB - Magic Workbench is a way to give your Workbench a whole new look. Through the careful use of colors MWB helps achieve a more pleasing and 3D looking GUI. It really looks good!
10. Miami - Miami is a new addition to my system. It  changes  the  way  the  Amiga  gets  on  the  Internet  from extremely hard to sheer simplicity.
11.  Stonecracker - Over the years there have been several  file  compressors  for  the  Amiga.  They  were  very important because we used floppies to run our systems, and needed to get the most out of the disk. Hard drives may have eliminated that need for some users, but I saw that compressing the files was still useful… loads faster and saves wear and tear on the drive. PowerPacker and Imploder are two other file compressors that I have used. Stonecracker makes smaller files than either and they decompress faster.
12.  ReOrg  -  This  is  the  ultimate  disk  optimizer. Prior to ReOrg, optimizers were a little dangerous to use. They took forever, and worse they could crash during use. This made backing up a necessity before use. So far ReOrg has never crashed, and it is fast! I use it regularly to keep my disk working at a peak of performance.
13.  KingCON  -  This  is  the  ultimate  upgrade  for your Shell. This does so many things to your Shell, you will probably forget most of them. Those that you remember will make it a worthwhile addition. I recently saw that it was the most requested upgrade to be included in a new Workbench from Amiga International. If you use the Shell, get it.
14.  Play16  -  Play16  is  the  sound  player  for  everything! It supports AHI, which is quickly becoming the new Amiga sound standard.
15. ARQ - This little program finishes the requester that pops up to tell you what is going on. It adds a little animation  that  gives  the  requester  that  extra  bit  of  fun. Even better, it adds sound to the requester. You can attach any sound you want to any requester. What can I say, the Amiga can do it.

## Welcome

Welcome To The User Group Network A Message From Darreck Lisle, Amiga, Inc.

A miga, Inc. is pleased to have a direct link to the people that have keep the Amiga alive all of these years. Thanks to people like you the Amiga is still an out-standing system.

machine and how they were using it. Look out for these glimpses into the Amiga.

Thank  you  again  for  your  patronage  and  I  look forward to seeing you at the upcoming shows.

My definition of Amiga:

1. A vision or idea
2.  A  group  of  dedicated  users  that  have  bonded together to keep their ideas and creativity alive.
3. A group of people that have refused to settle for the mainstream, rebelling against the status quo. Normality is not a right - it is a choice.

This is what has kept us alive through these dark times.  Now  that  the  User  Group  Network  has surfaced and enrollment is growing daily, the Amiga community  has  become  that  much  stronger.  The future does look bright and morale is high.

I  am  in  the  process  of  working  with  Wayne Hunt  and  the  UGN  Team  to  create  an  avenue  for Developers,  Distributors,  and  Retailers  to  reach  as many Amiga Users as possible. Just because someone does not have an Internet connection, or subscribe to Amiga Magazines does not mean that they should be left in the dark.

Amiga,  Inc.  supports  the  magazines  and  we thank each and every one of them. Subscriptions levels are  low  these  days  and  a  lot  of  good  information  is being missed monthly.

Support the Amiga by supporting the folks that have stuck with us for so long:

- Amiga Developers
- Amiga Distributors
- Amiga Magazines
- Amiga Dealers

With the help of people like you, Amiga, Inc. has been busy supporting events, and promoting the Amiga.

Showcase  Cinemas  held  an  Amiga  Display  for the opening of the new James Bond movie, Tomorrow Never Dies .

The movie Titanic used the Amiga extensively in production.

I receive many reports of Amiga's being used in all  sorts  of  areas  daily.  A  deal  has  been  worked  out with the Magazine Editors. Due to my lack of time, I cannot follow-up all of these leads. I will pass all leads to them and they can follow up and report on them. I have  always  wondered  who  was  using  our  beloved

## Quake

## The Official Announcement From clickBOOM

O n  January 5, 1998 PXL computers [http://www.pxlcomputers.com/] and clickBOOM [http://www.clickboom.com/] revolutionize the Amiga games market yet one more time -Quake Amiga  is  announced.  The  Original  Quake  was written for PC by id software.

'Quake is the biggest, baddest bloodiest and most atmos- pheric 3D action game ever conceived'

- PC Gamer
- 'The most important PC game ever'
- PC Zone

'Quake looks like no other game and perfectly displays id's trademark fusion of nightmarish art and advanced technology'

- Wired

'The  new,  radically  different  graphics  engine  delivers mesmerizing 3D effects'

- Time

Quake contains the most advanced 3D engine in the world. Moreover, players can connect to any one of several hundred Internet servers from around the world and join fast and furious battles against other users. Not only does Quake give the unbelievable amount of gameplay with its built-in options, it also features the most flexible core ever seen  in  a  video  game.  This  allows  Quake  users  to  create Quake 'add-ons' (also known as 'packs'). Quake add-ons can range from simple new levels and weapons to Quake movies and demos, to 'total conversions' that change the way Quake is being played.

Total conversions allow Quake players to take control of  James  Bond  in  the  MGM's  official  Tomorrow  Never Dies;  embark on a dangerous snake expedition in Sony's Anaconda; drive popular race cars in QuakeRally; control fighter bombers, tanks, helicopters, hovercrafts and other military vehicles in AirQuake; and much, much more.

All of the above options and more are now available on the Amiga. Quake is the first game to allow Amiga users to  join  the  Internet  gaming  community.  Connect  to  any Quake site and play against any combination of Amiga, PC or  Mac  users!  Plus,  Quake  Amiga  will  use  ANY  Quake add-on, from freeware to commercial ones! And for those who like one-on-one deathmatches, connect to any Amiga, PC  or  Mac  (modem,  cable  or  network)  and  gib!  No sacrifices - your copy of Quake is identical in options and expandability to PC or Mac.

Naturally,  in  order  to  make  it  more  Amiga-like, Quake also contains full locale support, Amiga-style menus, ARexx, the option to play it in a window on any public screen, and much more. The complete list and explanation of each option is impressive, and can be accessed from the clickBOOM web site (http://clickboom.com).

Various tournaments, competitions, and clans will be organized  in  the  near  future  for  Amiga  Quakers  by clickBOOM and various Amiga magazines. ANY Amiga player will be able to join as long as he is a REGISTERED user  of  Quake.  A  registered  user  is  a  person  who  buys Amiga Quake, fills out the registration card, and mails it back to clickBOOM.

At  the  moment,  Quake  has  entered  its  final  beta testing stage. After it is fully tested by clickBOOM it will be sent to Id software for their approval, and then to CD duplication  and  packaging.  If  all  goes  according  to  plan, Quake should be ready on Feb. 1.

Minimum Amiga required  to  play  Quake  is  68020 with FPU, 8Mb of RAM, CD-ROM and 30Mb hard drive.

Recommended configuration is 68060, 16Mb RAM, Internet connection.

## The Best of The BBS Uploads Selected by Bill Raecke

T he  Amiga  has  been  in  need  of  a  good  database program  for  some  time  now.  We  used  to  have SuperBase, but it hasn't been updated in over four years and, by today's standards, the interface is woefully inadequate.  SoftLogik  and  Softwood  both  offer  simple database programs, but neither of those supports relational database concepts, which leaves them out of the running as serious programs. Well, Fiasco (FIASCO.MAIN.LZX and FIASCO\_DOC\_ENG.LZX) may be the beginnings of an answer.  The  system  has  a  modern  MUI  interface  and supports relationships. The creation of a database involves not only the definition of the data that the database will hold, but a definition of the GUI as well. The interface is as flexible as you would expect a well-written MUI program to be. It also has an extensive ARexx interface which makes all  kinds  customized  updating  and  reporting  possible.  I don't claim to be an expert yet, but I was impressed enough to send in my shareware registration. At $25, it's a bargain.

![Image](1998_02_artifacts/image_000006_a666baa89444c37f9e87942a08de7bbab675d3d5e85faf9e76590d4e2fe17707.png)

with its Workbench look and feel and its ulimited directory windows. It's just not as simple to use as 4.x. (Don't shoot me, I'm just giving my personal opinion.) So, along comes RO  (RO\_V126.LZX)  by  Oliver  Rummeyer.  RO  is  a directory utility quite similar in capabilities to DOpus 4.x. It  has  just  the  two  directory  windows  (the  way  nature intended)  and  has  a  very  extensive  ARexx  interface.  Of course,  all  the  standard  functions  are  built  in.  As  with DOpus,  the  buttons  and  menus  are  configurable  by  the user. But what makes RO stand out is that it does all this a modern MUI based interface. It looks the way a program running  on  the  Amiga  in  1998  should  look.  The  demo version is fully functional, except that you can't save any modifications  to  the  standard  configuration  with  the preferences program. Registration is just $20. AGM

There is now a patch to upgrade AWeb to version 3.1. (AWEB31PCH.LZX) I have never considered AWeb to be the frontrunner in web browsers, but I may soon have to change  my  opinion.  This  release  makes  AWeb  the  first Amiga browser to support Javascript, something IBrowse has  been  promising  for  some  time  now  but  has  yet  to deliver. Note: This patch will only work on the registered version of AWeb. There is no demo version available at this time, although that will probable be corrected by the time you receive this newsletter.

Doom is now available for the Amiga. And it's free for the download. The authors of Doom have released the source code into the public domain and several people have taken on the job of compiling it for the Amiga. The one I'm  recommending  at  this  time  is  called  DoomAttack (DOOMATTACK.LZX). Georg Steger has rewritten some of  the  code  in  assembler.  That  makes  it  faster  than  the others.  It  is  so  fast  that  it  can  run  well  even  on  a  68030 based  Amiga.  Check  it  out.  Doom  is  more  fun  than  I expected it to be.

As  usual,  there  are  a  lot  of  datatype  updates  this month. Look for datatypes to handle: Mac Pictures (MACPICT2\_DTC40.0.LZX), JPEG pics (AKJFIF43135.LZX), lossless JPEG pics (AKLJPG43135.LZX), and PNG pics (AKPNG43135.LZX).

I've been using Directory Opus 4.x as my directory utility  for  years  now.  It  does  everything  I  need  it  to  do. And anything that it doesn't do for me, I can quickly make it do by using its ARexx port. But, like Superbase, its GUI has  fallen  behind  the  times.  Of  course  there  is  always DOpus 5.x, but I have found that to be a bit overblown

## Amiga by the Loop Johnny C. Kitchens Amiga By-The-Loop Meeting Johnny C. Kitchens

December had the usual for most people. Holidays, buying gifts, travel, and seeing family members. It did not bring us anything new, such as news on the Amiga. A few software  titles  were  announced,  and  the  PowerPC  accelerators from Phase5 began to generate some news, but not as much as I expected.

Our December meeting has, over the years, evolved into a Christmas party. People bring food and Amigas and we get to enjoy both. We got to see previews of Genetic Species and Uropa 2. These titles, from Vulcan, represent some of the most up-to-date game titles for the Amiga yet, though  they  are  inspired  by  previous  software.  Genetic Species  gives  the  Amiga  its  very  own  version  of  Doom. Though the demo is a bit hard to play, it sure looks good! Uropa 2 gives you a robot to go about and find things and kill the bad guys. Simple description, yes, but once again it sure looks good.

While about half of us are looking at the demo, the other  half  were  working  on  a  new  member's  machine, getting  it  up  and  running  correctly.  They  needed  the modem and scanner they brought along up and running. After a while we were all over there working on it. They were happy when it was finished, and the rest of us felt a sense  of  accomplishment.  Generally,  a  very  satisfying meeting!

I entered into the new year with more hope than ever that something would be said on the future of the Amiga. There are many signs of how well things are for the Amiga, and how well the users support the Amiga. A new webbrowser, called Opera, announced that it was supporting non-Windows  computers.  At  first,  no  mention  of  the Amiga was made. Someone talked them into including it. They asked for interested parties to visit their website and leave a message. The next day they made an announcement that  their  guest  book  was  overflowing  with  'Amiga Forever' messages!

AWeb-II 3.1 came out and announced it was the first with support for JavaScript. I took a look at AWeb-II 3.1 and compared it to IBrowse 1.12a, using a very complex website. I had noticed that IBrowse gave a very empty look to  the  upper  half  of  the  page.  I  figured  I  was  missing something, but not this much. AWeb showed lots of stuff was  missing.  To  say  that  it  was  impressive  would  be  an understatement. IBrowse has not done a thing since July, nor has there been any news on it. AWeb has taken the lead. Now if they would just offer a more standardized interface.

Doom showed up for the Amiga this month! When this game came out for the PC, several experts assured me that it could never be done on the Amiga. How many times have  I  heard  statements  like  that  used  in  reference  to computers. Impossible and never should be banned from computer conversations. Quake has now been announced for  the  Amiga,  from  the  people  who  brought  us  Myst… another PC supergame.

Our January meeting started off with an introduction to our new chapter president, Ned Kelly. Ned has carried many of our club titles over the years, and has handled each one with enthusiasm. We kicked off our meeting with a discussion about the new webbrowser I mentioned previously, Opera. This led to talk on Java, and all the work that is supposed to be taking place. Java was supposed to be out by the end of summer 97. Some talk on Workbench 3.5 came  up.  When,  was  the  main  question.  News  of  IBM about to show off a 1100MHz PowerPC generated some excitement.  Someone  asked  if  there  were  a  limit  to  the number  of  directories  you  could  have.  The  prevailing answer was no. Talk on removable media carried us along for a while. Zip, Jaz, SyJet, SparQ, LS-120, and few others were  all  discussed.  Another  long  discussion  of  webpage setup, kept us going for a while.

Probably our most exciting discussion was on Siamese and their new all-in-one unit. This puts the Amiga motherboard and a PC motherboard in one case and they work together as a unit. The Amiga gets to use the PC hardware for its own use. The new Boxer motherboard would make a good starting point. [Editor's Note: This turned out to be a case of advertising that gave an impression that simply wasn't true. What is currently being advertised as a 'Siamese PC' does NOT put both motherboards in the same box - the Amiga remains external - and the Amiga isn't included. To make things even worse, it's being advertised by a British company, and they won't ship to the U.S. Be on the lookout for a REAL Siamese system to be announced this month by an American manufacturer.  This  one  WILL  put  both  systems  -  PC  and Amiga - in the same box. They will share the same monitor, keyboard and mouse and, in fact, will share the same workspace (Workbench). You heard it here first!]

Our main presentation was to take a look at a modem problem  our  new  President  was  experiencing.  WAS  experiencing, as the problem never showed at the meeting. Bad phone lines? He will find out for sure now. At least he knows  the  modem  is  OK!  Next  month  we  will  have  a presentation  on  flatbed  scanners  and  setting  up  websites, with David Campbell giving the presentation.
