## BoXeR AMIGA MOTHERBOARD BoXeR Motherboard

The  BoXeR  motherboard  delivers  a  medium  cost home/semi-professional Multi-Media computing motherboard  based  on  the  Amiga  Chip  Set  and  Operating System. This will allow complete machines to be priced between the A1200 and A4000, providing low purchase price  and  expansion  options,  while  delivering  performance in excess of the A4000.

Blittersoft will be showing the latest development of the BoXeR  at  the  forthcoming  World  of  Amiga  show  in London. There will be a chance to meet the developer, Mick Tinker, at this event. The expected release date for the  BoXeR  motherboard  is  August  1998.  Customers, dealers and system builders can register their interest by completing our BoXeR Information Request Form.

The BoXeR will be sold in three ways : · As the heart of the new Blittersoft range of 'Black Box' Amiga systems · As a single motherboard solution to the customer, to build their own unique system

- Through OEM dealers who may customise the unit to their own particular markets
