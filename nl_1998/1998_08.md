## AmiWest '98 Report

13-Jul-98  02:00:01 I've  been back from AmiWest '98 for a few hours now.  It was hot! The show was held in the Ramada Inn in Sacremento. The Inn is a small hotel but cozy. AmiWest took up (at least) three rooms for the three day show.  The main room had about two dozen (guesstimate) boths and there were two seminar rooms in use almost constantly. In the main room, Holger Kruse (Miami) was there, as  was  Chris  Aldi  (Finale  Developement,  New  York, Quill, Voodoo, etc.), Kermit Woodall (ImageFX, Aladdin4D) as well as Paul Nolan (Photogenics\_NG) and a few others I can't remember (sorry). Various magazines (Amazing,  Informer)  and  services  (Amigazone-Harv Laser), and the user groups also had booths, as well as a few retail outlets (I got Genetic Species). Business seemed to be brisk. People were walking around with bags full of stuff and wearing new t-shirts as well. The seminars seemed to be well attended.  I sat in when Carl gave his second talk about REBOL, and also the demos/discussions with Chris Aldi and Paul Nolan (I really want  Photogenics\_NG!)  and  the  rooms  were packed. The mood was very positive and upbeat, in stark contrast  to  the  last  show  I  attended  in  '92  (WOA) Pasadena. Neither  Jeff  Shindler,  Joe  Torre,  Fleecy  Moss,  nor Alan Havemous could attend. We were told they were at very  important  meetings/negotiations  but  no  more  than that. Attending from Amiga Inc were Darrick Lisle, Events Co-ordinator  and  Bill  McEwen,  head  of  marketing  and software evangalist. The following, in no particular order (I've only had 8 hours sleep in the past three days) is the information I gathered while there:

· The rumor of an IBM buyout of Gateway is false · The rumor of BE buying out Amiga Inc is false

- The information in the Investment Business Weekly was badly misquoted and therefore is not correct.

Gateway is not for sale. Amiga Inc. is not for sale. (Carl added that REBOL isn't for sale either.) Speaking of

Dallas

REBOL, there should be a general version available early in  the  fall,  with  Amiga  one  of  the  first  platforms  supported. Re:  OS5.0 - The kernal to be used is the Amiga kernal. They will be using Exec. There will be direct Java support (JVM) as well as support for OpenGL. A developer program will be set up soon, projected date August (this year). Amiga Inc. wants ALL developers and developer wannabees to come and sign up on their site. There will be a special area (password protected) for developers to  get  and  exchange  information.  Anyone  who  is  even slightly  interested  is  encouraged  to  sign  up  (this  was emphasized). I don't have much on the MMC.  There were some rather  specific  specs  shown  but  I  couldn't  get  them written  down  fast  enough…  (sorry).  They  will  also  be posted on Amiga Inc's pages soon. We were told the chip was NOT being made by Intel, Cyrix (sp?) or AMD. When I get more specific information I shall, of course, post it. We were also told that Windows would NOT be on the  development  machine  (Amiga  Bridge  OS4.0).  'No money to Microsoft' is a direct quote. Bill McEwen said that  if  anyone  had  any  questions,  he'd  be  more  than happy  to  answer  them.  You  can  contact  him  at bm@amigainc.com. He said he would answer all polite mail. He also said he'd not answer any rude or nasty mail but that 'he would keep it.' Speaking of development. Olaf Bartel (sp?) has been doing extensive work in the Development CD and the RKMs,  they  have  been  bugfixed  and  upgraded  (now version 2.1). This should be available soon. Dave Haynie has also released a lot of information. It  can  be  found  on  http://www.thule.no/haynie/.    There will be more. Denny Atkins is coming back to the Amiga. There  might  be  a  bit  more,  but  I'm  getting  really tierd… If  I  remember  more,  or  get  more  clarification,  I shall  pass  it  on  to  you.  I  did  have  a  wonderful  time, despite the heat and some physical problems, and I feel more hopeful than ever about the future of the Amiga.

## Extravaganza Update

I  received  an  e-mail  from  a  member  on  an  idea  for  a class,  please  keep  on  sending  them  in.  A  raffle  for  an Amiga computer (4000?) is a possibility, we should know more next month. I have been in contact with other user groups and so far the Austin group, CTACS, thinks 6 or more of their  members will  attend  our  show.  The  Flea market forms are completed and will be available at the August  meetings.  Below  is  a  list  of  collectors  for  flea market items if you can't attend a meeting.
