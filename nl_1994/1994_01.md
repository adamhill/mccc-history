## METCOM 1993

it was fun it was educational it was economical it was colossal it was stupendous it was door prizes it was free!

## THE BIG THANK YOU NOTE!

(and apology for not getting into last months newsletter!) from Pete Goad

This particular article was destined for last months newsletter. Honestly!! However between my Amiga and the BBS Amiga despite the phone line...it apparently got dropped into the bit bucket! So apology over, here is the article... (PETE G.)

Arlington Convention Center was the place to be on November 6th. METCOM was the EVENT! This years METCOM is now over. If you came then you had fun, learned some things and maybe bought items from one of our four local dealers or the Flea-Market. If you were not one of the 350 people who attended the classes, watched the presentations, talked to other members, visited the club libraries and browsed through a myriad of new and used stuff then you missed out on another excellent show.

As usual I would like to thank the Arlington Convention Center staff for helping us present this years METCOM. They have helped us do this for the past several years and their professionalism in all aspects of METCOM is fantastic. Thank You Arlington Convention Center.

There are always many, many people to thank for an event like METCOM. The Dealers for their year round support but especially for their generosity during and before METCOM: Metropolitan Computers, Ansoft Data Systems, Dataphile Computers and Commodore Country. All four of our dealers had full tables at the beginning of the show — fortunately, by the end of the show none of these tables were as full as they had started out. Thank you to all our dealers for the participation and continued support of our club.

Remember, we the club members need to support our local dealers because our dealers depend on us too!

There were several presentations running throughout the day including uses of Amigas in different forms of media, from television to demonstrations. We had shows on the Toaster 4000 courtesy of Metropolitan, some brand new Imagine, Toaster videos and uses of Amigas for TV from Ansoft.

The classes, arranged by our very own Harold Williams, were well attended. I believe that the PageStream class was really HOT!!! We had a real problem with the heating system in Bill Racke's classroom! however Bill did a superb job of guiding the attendees though some of the intricacies of PageStream. Harold showed people how to care and feed their Hard Drives, David Owens gave people an idea of how they could use AmigaDOS/Workbench on their Amiga and Brett Hester introduced people to 2D and 3D work using several different software packages for the Amiga. Thank you to all our teachers and also to all the people who attended the classes making them a tremendous success.

Three times during the day a British voice could be heard above the melee of METCOM attendees. That voice would be requesting all those attendees to check their entry ticket stubs for the calling of Door Prizes. Johnny Kitchens is heaped with praise for rounding up excellent door prizes. Special thanks go to Metropolitan, Ansoft, Dataphile, Commodore Country, Psygnosis, Soft Logik, Gold Disk and INOVAtronies for the door prizes. Heaps of gratitude to all those who donated.

METCOM without FLEAS? No way!! One of the highlights of any METCOM is our Flea Market. This year was no exception. A HUGE and I mean HUGE mount of stuff was collected and organized by David Owens and his many assistants. As usual the 10:00am and 4:00pm rushes were frantic. You have never seen so much hardware and software being bought. For those of you who had items in the Flea Market, your money will be heading out to you as soon as John and David can get new · Page 3

Competition... If you read last month's newsletter and several prior to that, you already knew about the Competition. However, there was a disappointing number of entries. For those of you at METCOM you are already aware of the winners, but to officially have their names in print... Here they are...

## 1st Place

Michael Tilton for some remarkable work using various AMIGA packages to generate some phenomenal artwork, stamps and magnetic pictures.

## 2nd Place

Cameron Raecke for his original musical masterpiece entitled Electric Rain. Cameron used OctaMED to produce this work.

## 3rd Place

Jeff Fallon for his original score written using Deluxe Music Construction Set. Jeff's work was called BLUESI.

Thanks go out to all members who entered the competition and to all the judges who helped decide the outcome. Commiserations to all those who entered and didn't win. Don't let that put you off from entering next year!

Well, that pretty much wraps up this year's MIETCOM. I know that I enjoyed it and I reckon all those who attended had fun as well. Remember, it is FREE so if you couldn't make it this year then look forward to next.

Finally, a huge thank you to all the many folks that helped out. There really are too many to mention, but here goes (with apologies to those that I failed to mention). Judy and Joanna at the front registration table; Ned Kelly, John Malmstrom, Okley Moss and Gary Campbell for the club library and membership registration; David Owens, Gus Reiter, Mike Bond, Sheila Bond and the many helpers behind the Flea Market.

Most of all, thanks go to all the attendees of this years METCOM.

See you next year... Pete Goad.

I'm glad I went to the MetCom '93 show and you can count on me being there for the '94 show. The MCCC hosts and participating vendors were all very friendly. In the land of IBM, it sure was refreshing to see so much support for the Commodore line of computers!

## METCOM

the view from Abilene by Rick Russell from the newsletter of the Abilene AMIGA User Group aving attended my first MetCom show, I must was hosted by the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club (MCCC) at the Arlington Convention Center on Saturday, November 6th. In case you're curious, MetCom is derived from two words: Metroplex and Commodore. The MCCC has hosted MetCom for a few years now and each year just keeps getting better and better, according to some of the attendees I talked with. The MetCom '93 show was composed of several vendors selling their wares, a Computer Flea Market of used Commodore stuff, and classroom sessions on topics such as Hard Disk Drive Basics, PageStream Tips &amp; Tricks, and AmigaDOS for Beginners. There was plenty to see and do for the several hundred that I saw there and the crowd was still growing when I left! I never saw so many Commodore owners at one time in one place before!

Everything at the show supported a Commodore product of some type. Along with the Amiga 4000s, 2000s, 1200s, and used 500s, I saw a surprising number of C64s, C128s, and even an SX64 (Commodore's first and only portable computer!). The vendors covered the most area at the show and their prices were either at or below mail order prices! Check out the list of vendors present at the show. I didn't know that many existed in the Dallas/Fort Worth area! The Computer Flea Market had a few good deals, but some items were way overpriced. I guess you can't blame someone for trying to get back what he or she put into their system. I didn't attend any of the classes, so I can't really say too much about them. From the preparation that went into them, they looked to be well worth your time.

## WOCA Toronto

four reports from the recent Toronto show Reprinted from Amiga Report Online Magazine #1.37 — December 10, 1993

## Part One By Darren Eveland (develanduoguelph.ca)

Yes, I just got back from WOCA Toronto. Here is my quick and dirty summary:

The MPEG Module was QUITE impressive. They were playing Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Apparently this was hot off the press and had only been available for a week. They also had Top Gun, but they were told "not to show that" yet. Hmmm. No sign of the Bon Jovi video, but they did demo a music video called "killer". MPEG quality was equal to or better than current VHS technology. The freeze (pause) was awesome - crystal clear and no "noise". Oh ya, they had the European TV Commercial too - were showing that in MPEG and CDXL.

CD32 — Yes, they were for SALE. NTSC Version. Apparently C= had them flown in from their plant the night before, and the C= rep I talked to said they managed to squeeze one production run in for NTSC units. But that is it. The rest are PAL versions headed for Europe. Don't expect general availability in N. America until after Jan 1, 1994. Price in CDN dollars was $489.00, which translates to about $366.00 US. MPEG module will be available in Europe beginning Dec. 11, '93. No date was given for N. American availability. I expect the price to get lower by sunday (the end of the show).

GVP - GVP was demoing the EGS Spectrum (w/EGS paint), ImageFX for EGS (beta), TBC Plus, various accelerators, etc... A fairly large booth. I am not going to say much about the Spectrum since I have already bought one. But, they were selling for $599 CDN ($450 US) (2 meg ver.).

A-Max IV Colour - I talked to Simon Douglas about A-MAX IV-Colour, which was selling for $429 CDN ($322 US). They had been working on the software/hardware part of it since last January, and had been beta testing since August. Looked quite impressive, with lots of configuration options for memory, video, scsi, etc... Actual emulation looked nice, and was pretty fast. Expert Services had A-Max IV Colour running on a large monitor with the Picasso Video board hooked up. This WAS impressive. Very fast. Had 256, thousands, and millions

EMPLANT - Jim Drew was there along with a lady taking orders and another tech guy from UU. Emplant was looking nice. UU both was almost right across from Simon Douglas (programmer of A-MAX IV Colour) and his demo (rather uncomfortable!!!). Jim was saying how he has 11 patents pending on Emplant. Emplant was selling for about $360 CDN (basic model).

colour options. Bug fixes are free, and major upgrades may cost a small fee.

A4000T — Well, where was it? I didn't find it...but maybe I didn't look too hard.

What can I say? Emplant and A-Max IV Colour both do good jobs at emulating a Mac. You'll have to make your own decision about which is better.

Amiga CD32 external units — C= had hoped to show them at WOCA, but for some reason they were not there. I did learn that both will be external units. C= officials would not tell me how it will hook up to either machine. Only users with AGA machines will get to use these drives though. Look for them in Q1.94.

There was A LOT of stuff going on at the show, so this is just a highlight of what products I found interesting... I'm going back again on Saturday to return a HD A3000 floppy which does not work : 1, so maybe I'll glean some more info from C=. I'll try to sit in on the C= "future directions" seminar with Lou E head of engineering). Maybe he'll know some goodies about AAA.

PageStream 3.0 — All I can say is: Looked impressive. Price for PS 2.2 was 199 CDN (tax included, ($149 US)), which will get you a free upgrade to 3.0 when it is released Q1 94.

See ya!

## Part Two By Roy Park (roy.parkcanrem.com)

Hello everyone... (ya ya, it's Roy Park again) :)

Since I went to WOCA Toronto CBM keynote addressing session, I thought I'd let ya know some stuff that was said (note: the following is what I think I heard.. so if there's any mis-information, blame my ears, not me!)

First, WOCA in general:

The MPEG module for CD32 was NOT available at the show (I'll get into that later)

CD32 was for sale at $499 CDN

A very few number of vendors attended (IMO)

Lots of interesting stuff: Picasso II, Piccolo, Spectrum, Studio 16 3.0, LightRave, PageStream 3.0 demo, and lots of CD32 for the people to touch and experiencel!).

About 3 local Amiga dealers were present, busy selling CD32

ONE CD32 unit with MPEG module was playing "StarTrek VI: Undiscovered Country" at the show... many WOW's from the crowd.

There are over 120 registered software developers

Now, the news from CBM...:

for CD32.

The MPEG module (or FMV) is now in production! It will be available very soon (within a couple weeks time.. about 2 weeks I guess) and the NTSC CD32 owners can buy FMVs early from European market (if they wanted them that bad) since FMV recognizes NTSC/PAL correctly and output at a right freq.

Commodore has just licensed PhotoCD from Phillips. (not from Kodak) Lew says they can now say "PhotoCD compatible" on CD32, but not "Kodak PhotoCD compatible"... I'm not sure how this works legally.

Commodore is hiring back some of oid Software Engineers (!) and they'll be working on to complete RTG. *note: they could be NEW software engineers, he didn't exactly say 'hiring back'...it's my imagination. So ex-CBM engineers, don't quit your day job!

AAA stuff:

- 1) the chips are 95% ready (in other word, the chips they have works 95% of the functionality from what they planned originally)...and some MINOR bugs has to be found.
- 2) the 2 of the chips will go into 2nd pass soon, and the other 2 will go into 2nd pass in February. From what I hear, if everything goes well (meaning they get the chip they want from 2nd pass) the actual AAA machine wouldn't take too long to come out.
- 3) Commodore finally decided to use Intel's PCI for the system bus purposes.
- 4) DSP will be an integral part of AAA. CBM's expecting to be using AT&amp;T 3210 DSP for this. (with VTOC or something...which I don't know how to spell, nor know what it is).

"Beyond AAA" (from Lew's words)

Commodore has already assigned two engineers for systems beyond AAA chipset. He said it's CBM's intention to have some sort of 3D workstation by the end.

Currently the new projects are:

- 1) 30 million pixels per sec graphics rendering engine.

2) 3D rendering engine.

Well, that's about it! I tried to be most accurate as possible to what Lew Eggebrecht said, so don't be throwing those nasty hot flames at me! Lier!

## Part Three By J. Moore (1:229/15.0 on FidoNet)

These are my personal observations and thoughts and not really an attempt to be comprehensive. The size of the thing was about the same as last year, with some smaller booths for many vendors but larger booths for the stores. No shows included Opal, who probably don't want to hear any more questions about when the modules are appearing. Big shows included the Montreal Toaster distributors, whose demo guy gave the exact same presentation he's been giving for as long as I've seen them

(it's getting a little old guys — you're gonna make the Toaster look dull) and Scala, which was very nice. The Scala seminar/demo was one good show as well, and the biggest shock for me was seeing the guy run the whole thing from a 1200 with an '020 and 4 MB ram. And he ran it out through the RF port to a projector TV and it looked GREAT! Scala is the one program that looks better every time I've seen it; like real easy to use and effective. They were showing Scala MM300, which has more wipes, anti-aliasing for their fonts, and other little goodies like the clicking sound you get when you hit the buttons. They are also working on many goodies, among them an editing setup for prosumer vers with infrared sensors, Toaster controllers, etc. etc. etc. If you're doing presentations or even thinking of it, get it! (IBM did.) The price at the show: C$250 (US$190) for MM210 (approx. C$130 to upgrade to MIM300, available in a month or so).

The other big shock of the show was prices: bargains were to be had for a change. Americans were spotted leaving the show with 5 A1200s in their arms. A1200s were C$499 (US$378), CD32s were C$475 (US$360), Sunrize had Studio 16 for around C$1350 (about US$1000). The Scala price at C$250 was good, but a buddy and I got it for 2 for C$425 (C$212.50 each = US$161). Usually Canadians have gone to the States for deals, but now Americans were doing the cross-border shopping:

Saw a good feature on PhotoCD. OS 3.1 will have CD support as part of the OS (and maybe PhotoCD support as well - I didn't go see Lew Eggbrecht's talk wherein he gave out the offical word on C='s dealings with Kodak re PCD). Saw the CD32 stuff; sorry, I'm not into games enough to give a good review. They looked fine to me, and the MPEG module's playback looked okay: about like something you recorded on a mid range VHS deck in the 4-hour mode instead of SP. Emplant had a booth, and was selling boards at some sort of deal, but didn't bring any deal for the dealers, which annoyed them (annoying your dealers doesn't seem like the best marketing strategy to me); they didn't even have boards to sell. With Amax for sale at the show with a free upgrade path to the upcoming "same as Emplant"- type software, it seems like Emplant picked the wrong time to let their dealers down.

I'm sure other news will be posted - that's the stuff that struck me as most interesting. TTYL.

## Part Four By Sean Caszatt (1:2601/512 on FidoNet)

Well, I made the trip to Toronto this weekend for the World of Commodore Amiga show there and here's a little of what I saw:

CD32 — great system, horrible games. Sorry, but that's the way I feel. The CD32 "arcade" that was set up had James Pond 2, Oscar, Sleepwalker, Pinball Fantasies, a really cool flight simulator (no name), Arabian Knights,

and a side-to-side shooter that looks sort of like Project X If they release one more platform game, I'm going to scream.

A BMD rep (who was importing a lot of CD32 titles) told me that the sales of the CD32 were disappointing because of the lack of available software titles. Only about 8 games were available for actual sale. BMD's shipment of about 20 games were held up in customs and would probably not make it to the show on time. At no time did I see anyone carrying a CD32 around (after purchasing one). I still saw a lot of A1200's walking around with people though.

On the gaming side of things: Mortal Kombat was there, running on an A1200...and it was very impressive. Looked as good as my SNES version (and, yes, it has the blood.) It was fast and fluid too (very much UNLIKE Street Fighter II) No CD32 version though, not yet anyway. When it makes the transition, it will be just as good as the console versions are now. Jurassic Park was on sale there, but I didn't see any demos of the game anywhere. It was only available for the A1200/A4000.

Commodore's booth also had a number of CD32's running stuff, but it was a lot more promising to see the stuff there. They had Star Trek VI running on CD (a CD-I cd-video). A woman was freezing the motion, rewinding, fast-forwarding all with the CD32's controller. That was impressive. MICROCOSM was there and looked great. I've been hearing about it forever, and seeing it was really cool. Of course, the Toaster and SCALA were there showing the multimedia side of the Amiga. Studio 16 v3.0 was there. PageStream 3.0 was there. Emplant was there (the first time I've had a chance to see it...impressive!). AMax IV was directly across from Emplant, and looked slow…..but it works. The A4091 was there in DKB's booth. (They've picked it up and will be marketing it.) Piccolo, Picasso II, and the EGS Spectrum card were all there (in separate booths of course.)

My whole impression of the show was dampened by the CD32's poor showing. The console has the potential to kick ass, and is being given meager titles to run. MICROCOSM and the unnamed flight simulator (called Flight Demo by someone there) gave a glimpse of what the machine can do. They were the most impressive AGAtype titles I've ever seen. I hope those titles come fast and furious.

## Ten Years Ago

the history of the MCCC

ig changes were taking place. The club authorized Bine Vial Per Work, That mas the bring of and West Fort Worth. This was the beginning of the chapter setup the club now has. Before this the entire club met at one location in one huge meeting room with 200 or so in attendance. The new chapters were to hold their first meetings in February. The first order of business would be to elect officers, set a meeting time and place and decide on a name.

Club membership stood at 204.

The featured hint of the month in the newsletter was a procedure of print the directory of a disk:

1. Insert disk for desired directory.
3. Type - OPEN 4,4,2 [RETURNI
2. Type - LOAD "*", 9 [RETURN]
4. Type - CMD 4 [RETURN]
5. Type - LIST (RETURNI
6. Type - PRINT #4, CLOSE 4 [RETURN

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke ineRunner by Matthias Bock MineRunner is another LodeRunner clone. Yes, I know we've had them before. In fact, I wrote about Targis in these very pages back in August. This one is special because it is a close approximation of the original. It looks the same, sounds the same and plays almost the same (it's a little faster than the original). It contains 50 of the original levels.

For those who are still unfamiliar with LodeRunner, it is a "platform" game. You are set loose on a screen where your job is to collect all the small round objects you see. Along the way, you need to avoid the bad guys who can kill with their touch. Your only weapon is the ability to dig pits into which you or your opponents can fall. I could try to explain in more detail, but there's not much point. Just get it and try it for yourself. This one is well worth having. You'll find it on MCCC-A 620.

## MegaBall AGA by Ed Mackey

While we're on the subject of games, here's another one you really need to get. Most people are probably familiar with this one by now. MegaBall is a game based on the original BreakOut. The idea is that you have a block of bricks that need to be knocked out with a ball that bounces between the bricks and a paddle at the bottom of the screen that you control. Just keep the ball bouncing and you have it make. There are a lot of surprises along the way to keep things challenging. MegaBall is not new to the library, but this is a new version that provides full AGA support for those who have AGA capable computers. Of course it still works fine for the rest of us as well.

MegaBall is probably the best implementation of the BreakOut concept that I have seen. What makes it even better is that this version is FREE. By the way, there is a better version available if you send in your registration along with a $15 fee. It contains several hundred different screens and a screen editor. In the meantime, this one is terrific. It's on MCCC-A -623.

## Headline Fonts by Lion Kuntz

We haven't had a lot of new fonts lately, but there are a tew really nice ones this month. On MCCC-A\_624 you'll find a collection of four display fonts (American Gothic Bold, Coffee Can, Phoebus and SpringTime), and one Dingbat font (July Fourth). These are all very high quality. Check 'em out.

## Pictures

What would a month be without the addition of some new pictures to add to your collection? This month's selection is slim — just one picture. But it's an excellent example. Look for Carnation on MCCC-A\_624. It's digitized, it's pink, it's JPEG, and it's very high quality.

## ARexx Guide by Robin Evans

If you're an ARexx user, this one's for you. I program in ARexx quite often but it's a bit of a hassle grabbing for the manual and looking up those rarely-used commands. The manual's fine, but I don't really have a place to put it even when I've found it. A better solution would be to have all that reference material available online. And now that's exactly where it is. The ARexx

The opening screen of MegaBall

![Image](1994_01_artifacts/image_000004_4016a2dfd1b2471695e634f30db817c64237a46fd187b836a5d297bb06621fe5.png)

Guide is just what I needed. Robin Evans has taken the time to write a complete ARexx reference guide in AmigaGuide format. It's all nicely categorized and easy to use. Of course, some of our ARexx library extensions are not included - just the standard stuff - but it still makes working with the language easier than before. It's on MCCC-A\_621.

## Updates

Several upgrades this month — all on MCCC-A \_624. Not much to say about any of them except get 'em. There's a new SetPatch command from Commodore for AmigaDOS 2.1 to 3.1 owners. There's an upgrade to MagicMenu that now works properly with programs like TypeSmith and Art Expressions. And there's an upgrade to Static Ram (the SDO: recoverable RAM disk device).

## CP/M Speed

## make your CP/M C-128 run quicker by Phil Heberer

smael Cordeiro on the CBM-128 echo of Fidonet 1 secting up CoM on the C123 and about 3akng a speeding up CP/M on the C128 and about making a more efficient use of it. I think, I think, but I never begin to write it. Randy Winchester wrote an excellent article about the subject called "Supercharging CP/M" but I would like to go further. Some of the explanations in this message are taken from it and they will be identified by a

Speeding up is very easy and you only need CONF.COM on your boot disk and a line in your PROFILE.SUB. The line is:

CONF 40COL-OFP, BAUD=134, FEEL=0, VOL=0, PRT1=ASCI15

Here's what it does:

4OCOL=OFF - Normally C128 CP/M has both screens, 40 and 80 columns, enabled at the same time. If you are using the 80 column screen, what I hope you are, there's no need for the 40 column screen. Disabling it speeds up the whole processing because CP/M doesn't need to process the same information twice. That's what this command does.

BAUD=134 — "The interrupt driven R$232 routines are always enabled, and set for an unreasonably high 300 baud. The higher the baud rate, the more interrupts are needed to service the RS232 port, and the less time the processor has to do its work."(RW) Reducing the baud rate with this command gives more time to the processor to handle the really important jobs it has to do. Randy suggests 75 baud, but I felt that, at that speed, I was missing some keypresses when using ZDE. The same happens with 110 baud. That's why I choose 134 as the baud value. You can try 75 and 110 and see how they feel.

FEEL=0 — "The FEEL parameter adjusts the number of interrupts used by the keyboard driver. The value indicates the number of interrupts skipped. A value of 1 tells the driver to every other interrupt. At 75 baud, FEEL should be disabled by setting it to 0."(RW) This command is a companion to the BAUD one. The best setting for 134 baud and lower is 0.

VOL-0 - This command is for setting the volume of the annoying key clicks. Setting it to 0 turns the volume off. Besides, I've read somewhere that by doing this the system is speeded up a little bit more.

PRT1=ASCII5 — This command tells CP/M that you are using an ASCII printer with a Secondary Address of 5 (This sets most printer interfaces into Transparent mode).

These are the main things you can do for speeding up C128 CP/M. They make a big difference. You can have still more speed by installing ZPM3. With

CONF.COM you can change the screen and character colors, set the printer's device number, secondary address and type (ASCII or PETSCII), etc. If you have CONF.HLP on your disk also, each of the CONF commands can be called up by typing HELP at the prompt. ZPM3 is the core of CP/M rewritten in Z80 Assembler for more speed and efficiency. ZPM3.TXT says: "ZPM3 offers all the good things that CP/M 3.0 does, and then it offers more. Because ZPM3 is written in Z80 code rather than the 8080 code of CP/M 3.0, it can do everything that CP/M 3.0 does, but in much less space. With the extra space recovered, ZPM3 packs in a number of new facilities. Yet the whole package fits in exactly the same space as CP/M 3.0 so you can directly replace your old CP/M 3.0 BDOS with ZPM3 without a worry. ZPM3 is also fast. Faster, in fact, than CP/M 3.0. This is possible because the rich Z80 instruction set allows many algorithms to be implemented more efficiently. In addition, the extra space available in ZPM3 has been put to use to further optimize the code. Lots of small optimizations smooth the execution flow, so ZPM3 becomes the fastest operating system on most banked CP/M computers." To install it you have to replace the BNKBDOS3.SPR and RESBDOS3.SPR files in the C128 CP/M source code with the ones from ZPM3 and recompile the source code. Don't bother trying MAKEDOS.COM because it doesn't work with the C128 CP/M. (An installed version is available in the MCCC disk library.) With PROFILE.SUB you can do many things. Put DATE SET on it and you'll be asked for the date and time when booting. Another excellent thing in CP/M is the drive search path. If it's set, when you enter a filename in the command line, CP/M searches for the program in all drives in the search path. You can also set a temporary drive, which is used by some programs to store, of course, temporary files. Drive M is the best choice for a temporary drive. The program for doing all that is SETDEF, and CP/M allows you to specify four drives. The idea is to put the faster drives first. In my PROFILE.SUB

SETDEF M: *,B:A: [TEMPORARY=M:]

where M: = drive M (ramdisk) * = current drive B: = drive B (1581 in my setup) A: = drive A (1571 in my setup). If you have an REU, you should put it as the first drive. If not, put the current drive (*) as the first one. You can set the colors with CONF using the CHAR and BACK commands. You can also modify your keyboard configuration with KEYFIG. I put the name of programs I use very often in the F keys. I have just to press one of → Page 11

## Bubbles or Heat

Primera and Canon color printers compared downloaded from GEnie - author unknown his article compares two color printers for use with and the other is the Primera. The Canon BJC-800, big brother to the BJC-600, was reviewed in an article in AmigaWorld and compared with Epson and HewlettPackard printers and was a clear winner judging from the printouts that were shown. That winner is now compared with a hot contender named Primera and conclusions are based on extensive tests of the two printers side by side under similar, if not identical, conditions. I purchased both printers at exactly the same price and both with a 30 day money back guarantee. I'm sending back the Canon and keeping the Primera.

## Similarities

Both printers are sheet fed and can accommodate a stack of about 50 sheets of paper at the input side. Best prints are made on coated paper stock. Both printers are capable of producing transparencies. Both are roughly the same size and occupy about the same space on your desk top. Both are in the same price range - affordable. Both are capable of either color printing or gray scale printing and show no raster lines under either circumstance.

Both printers eject prints from the front of the machine. Both have strong points as well as weak points - no surprise. Both printers were judged mainly on the visual quality of the prints which they produced. Printing time and support were also strong influences on conclusions and recommendations.

## Differences

The Canon is a bubble jet printer whereas the Primera is thermal transfer printer. The Canon uses four cartridges of ink namely yellow, cyan, magenta, and black supplied the form of small cassettes which are then installed on the print head which moves horizontally across the print during operation. The Primera uses a wide ribbon (8" wide) which contains panels of ink or wax in each of the three colors or four colors depending on the ribbon currently installed. In three color printing, the yellow is transferred first to the paper which is then sucked back into the printer and the magenta is laid on top of the yellow. The paper is partially ejected to show you what is happening and then is sucked back in to put the final color (cyan) on top, at which point the color print is ejected.

Canon paper is loaded at the rear and is ejected from the front whereas in the Primera the paper is loaded in front and ejected in front. The Canon, as typical with ink jet and bubble jet printers, lays down its picture line by line putting all of the colors down in each line as it progresses. This means a difference in the communicating time between the computer and the printer since the Canon only requires one line of information at a time whereas the Primera requires information about the entire print before the cycle starts. The Canon begins to print shortly after the print signal is sent from the computer whereas the Primera sits and does nothing for anywhere from a few seconds to a minute while it digests all of the information. Even though the Canon starts sooner to print the image it somehow takes longer. Once the Primera has digested all of the information it needs, the printing cycle is only about 2 minutes regardless of the size of the file that is being worked on. This means that typical printing times for the Primera with large and complex color images is about four minutes, but about eight minutes for the Canon. It is clear that the Primera wins the speed race. Even on coated paper the Canon prints look dull and have a difficult, if not impossible, time reproducing a good black because the surface is essentially rough after the printing and does not absorb light as well as if it were glossy.

By contrast, the Primera lays down a waxy ink on the surface which even feels slick like the surface of a printed magazine and the blacks, even with only three colors, are deep and rich and provide a much snappier looking print than comes from the Canon. This is not a fault in design but rather a difference in the two techniques which cannot be overcome by wishful thinking or change in paper or any other sort of magic.

The Primera wins again.

The Canon claims 360 dots/inch whereas the Primera claims 208 dpi. which is equal to eight lines per millimeter. The human eye, at arms length viewing distance is barely able to resolve ten line per millimeter if the eyes are young and 20/20. Consequently, no difference in the resolution in the two machines seems to appear in the prints. For an objective test of this feature I prepared a bar chart of different spacial frequencies (pixels per inch) on the screen of the Amiga. I printed this chart on both machines. On both, the finer lines at arms length began to look gray, having lost their contrast due to merging. Under a ten power glass you can see that there is some dithering that mixes the black and white together so that they appear gray. Consequently a resolution claim is not meaningful for a dithered color print, as all of them are. That seems to explain why the difference in claimed resolution does not show up in a real picture.

The same target was printed on both machines in the black &amp; white mode whereupon the contrast was regained along with loss of the gray look. Under a 10X magnifier, both printers produced sharp, high contrast lines with ragged edges due only to the grain of the paper. On film, the results would have been better yet.

Both printers can make film transparencies, suitable for overhead projection. However, the Primera can make films suitable for heat transfer to T-shirts and other materials such as porcelain, heat resistant plastics and other heat tolerant surfaces.

## Support

The Primera arrived and the package included a driver on an Amiga disk with an install program which worked without a hitch and put the Primera driver into the preferences list along with the other printers already there.

There are three things to load in the Primera namely paper, ribbon and software. No problem with any of these so I was up and running in a short time after I got through the styrofoam packing.

The Canon came with an envelope containing a driver for the IBM and one for the MAC, neither of which is the Amiga. I talked to the supplier who said that as far as they knew it was compatible with an Epson LQ2550 which they didn't have and didn't know where to get one. I called the Canon HOTLINE, they gave me the same song and dance and even though they also make the BJC-800, they had no drivers for the Amiga. They also have a bulletin board with drivers which you can download but again it's for the IBM and the MAC - nothing for the Amiga.

I spoke to a man who knows the SYSOP of the BBS at Canon and suggested that they start an Amiga section because there are a million of them out there and without some kind of a driver they will never sell anything to their users. He said he would relay the message because it sounded like a good idea. We'll see. Meanwhile I searched amongst several Bulletin Boards having read an article somewhere that there is a man in Germany who has a Canon Factory which specializes making printer drivers for the Canon. Down deep in Fred Fish Disk 738 I saw a driver for the BJC-800 listed on GEnie and hopefully guessed it might work in the BJC-600, so I downloaded the file and spent considerable time trying to figure how to unpack the file. The files ended in pkd and the Canon factory people kindly included a little program called "unpack." It is now in my c: directory where I can use it via Directory Opus. Having done that I found that there are drivers in there for about eight or ten different Canon bubble jet printers as well as ink jet printers. A real gold mine if you can find it but don't expect any help from Canon.

After I installed the driver in the preferences printer list, tests were made with the Canon. Results indicated that I had found a useful, maybe not optimum, driver since the two machines responded differently to different kinds of Amiga software packages.

I operated both printers from three different software packages, namely ADPro, Deluxe Paint-AGA and Brillance. Prints from DPaint and Brillance were dark on both printers and neither program has any sort of provisions for changing the brightness or contrast or color balance. On the other hand, ADPro has all of this capability and worked well with the Primera in lightening up the prints to where I could see details in the shadows as well as in the highlights and could adjust contrast and gamma to get a full range color print. However, I tried to drive the Canon from ADPro, but the time was so extensive that I usually aborted prints after 20 minutes halfway through the print. So that it looks like 40 minutes would be a typical printing time if I had the patience. That happens to be a nice feature about the Canon — namely that you can abort the printing at some point, whereas with the Primera you've got to go with the

Primera offers a four color ribbon priced only slightly higher than the three color ribbon but it makes fewer prints. They also offer a gray scale ribbon which makes considerably more prints than either of the color ribbons. This is easy to understand since a fixed length of role will accommodate only a fixed number of panels. The following chart shows the number of prints that can be made from a ribbon: three color, four color and monochrome. It also shows something about the prices of the ribbons as sold by Fargo Electronics.

| The number of prints is: 400 Monochrome......   | $40/roll = 10 cents/print   |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 115 3-color..                                   | $45/roll = 40 cents/print   |
| 80 4-color                                      | $45/roll = 56 cents/print   |

The price per print for the Canon is likewise calculated, as follows: Using a total of $33.50 from Tenex as the price for all four ink cartridges and their stated number of prints per set of cartridges as about 135, gives a price of 25 cents/print. The ink cartridges can be purchased separately so if you do a lot of black and white printing the black cartridges is going to go first and its replacement does not require you to replace the yellow, magenta or cyan.

## Controls

The Primera has two buttons on the front and two LED indicators. One is for power and the other is for online. Blinking of the online button at different rates indicates different kinds of trouble if there is any...and there seldom was when I made my tests. The Canon control panel on the other hand has about eight buttons. One is power, one is online, another is form feed. In the center there is one button that allows you to choose one of four conditions indicated by four LEDs. There are two more buttons on the right which allow you to tell the printer whether you're using thick stock or envelopes as compared to normal print paper.

It's pretty obvious to me that the Primera was designed strictly to produce good color graphics and even though there is a resident font, judging from the self test, which could be used for printing documents, seems like expensive overkill. I personally see no need for such a thing in a color image printer.

The Canon on the other hand, has a whole bevy of fonts and a lot of control buttons and dip switches, etc. which make me believe that they intended for it to be the only printer on your desk and, therefore, to be used for

word processing, spreadsheets and all other manner of text printing in addition to printing color graphics. I found it to be quite good at all of the other things but the color graphics are not up to snuff when compared with the Primera as previously opined. The Primera comes complete with a manual of 53 pages of which 10 are devoted to warnings about FCC regulations, specifications and other necessary things. The remaining manual is short and to the point and in big print telling you how to get moving and also how to get out of trouble when you encounter it.

The Canon manual is about a half inch thick and has about 150 pages all of which are necessary to tell IBM people and others about escape codes, font choice, form feed, tab spacing, and other info. that has nothing to do with making a good picture. The Canon manual is all in the English language whereas the Primera manual contains about ten pages of FCC warnings in eight different languages, seems like a good opportunity to learn another language if you feel so disposed.

## Tests

I tested both printers using about four different images — one of which was the ad for the Brillance paint program as seen on the back of many magazines along with an announcement "Now Shipping." I chose that because it's familiar to many of the people who own Amiga's. Another image was the OpalVision logo which contains many subtle shades and tonal gradations, etc. and is a very god test for printers which are designed to produce artful, pretty prints. Getting more technical, the reference palette included with Deluxe Paint was used, showing six basic colors at five different levels of saturation. The fourth and technical image was the resolution target which I described earlier.

Just looking at the prints side by side lined up on the floor showed that Primera to be the winner in every case because of the better saturation in the blacks and generally better appearance because of the shiny surface. I put a couple of the prints - same image from different printers — side by side on a copy machine and found that the Primera was again the big winner as seen by the color copier. Also, photographs of the prints side by side on the floor showed the same differences that were visually obvious.

Tests with the resolution target were essentially equal from both printers, as reported above.

## Conclusions

Based solely on the difference in visual print quality, the Primera is an outstanding printer compared to anything I have seen on the market other than $5,000 machines or a printing press. The Canon may have appeal to those who are looking for a jack of all trades printer in one box, but there are faster, cheaper and better ways of printing documents of equal quality.

I prefer two printers which I now have.

One is the Primera...the other is an Olivetti B&amp;W ink jet which moves very fast and sports 360 DPI. Besides documents, it prints very good grey scale images looking very much like a laser printer but at only a fraction of the price. A switch box gets me from Primera to Olivetti without leaving the computer since both are sheet fed.

Worth noting, the Primera uses a friction drive to run the paper in and out between laying down the sequence of colors. There are some registration marks in the self-test image, and even under 10X no color fringing can be seen. A remarkable acheivement for a friction drive.

The Canon would not have a regitration problem since all colors are running along on the same carriage with the four bubble jets concentrated at a point on the paper. As expected, no color fringing was seen when printing fine black lines in the resolution target.

## Recommendations

In view of the above it seems hardly necessary to say very much here and so I won't.

them and the program is called. I also reconfigured the numeric keypad, emulating the IBM keypad in nonnumeric mode (PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, DELETE, etc.), using the Wordstar commands which, are used by many CP/M programs.

Another good thing is automatically loading to drive M the programs you use often. I have there DD, NSWP, ZDE, SCAN, etc. You should put the programs to be loaded in the user area 1 of your boot disk (usually Al) and put this line in your PROFILE.SUB:

PIP M:[GO]=A:* *[G1]

PIP will copy all the files in drive Al to drive MO. Use the Kaypro IV disk format for your 1571 disks. It has a faster access than the C128 CP/M disk format and stores 390k instead of 363k. Read the HELP file with the HELP command. It gives lots of information about C128 CP/M If you want to extract the HELP commands to a text file rather than going through the on line help utility, copy HELP.HLP to a freshly formatted CP/M disk. (PIP E:=A:HELP. HLP for those of you with only one disk drive.) Once the file is copied, at the A&gt; prompt (or whichever drive you are using: B&gt;, M&gt; etc.) type HELP [EXTRACTI. This will modify the HELP.HLP file, so make sure this is a COPY and NOT the original! To read the file, just use the TYPE command (TYPE HELP.HLP) or you can send the file to the printer with LST:HELP.HLP. If you don't want to bother with this, the extracted file is also available on the MCCC CP/M library disks.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Goad

The December meeting went as planned, which is more than I can say for the newsletter, that was rather lacking the loop's club meeting report and also my METCOM report, but I digress. So here is to the more normal reporting as usual. The demonstration this month was of the Retina 24 bit video board from Macro Systems. A very thorough demo of all its ins and outs was given by Eddie Monjay, but more on this later.

was the lack of an NTSC output, and running a regular Amiga animation was a huge pain since the board had to convert to its own animation format.

The meeting started at 7:30 pm. with a slew of announcements. The most important of these announcements was the voting in of the new chapter officers. Next year's president will be Ben Clingerman with his right hand man/vicepresident Wayne Brodnax.

There then followed a question and answer session this ranged from CDROM questions to public domain conversion programs that allow users to translate picture formats across platforms.

Now onto the presentation... Eddie Monjay started his presentation with a video showing some of the rendered animations that he has done. As usual with the visual presentations the author cannot do justice to the fantastic detail and effort that goes into these animations. WOW! you should have been there. Eddie then proceeded to give a rundown of the various features of the Retina 24 board including cost for the two versions. A 2meg and a 4meg version are available. The board itself has the capability to emulate the Workbench if the application makes all the correct calls and hence stavs within Commodore's software guidelines. It will even turn a regular A2000 and A3000 into an AGA type machine. There are several negative aspects that Eddie had with the board: first

Eddie then proceeded to demonstrate the board using some PHOTOCD pictures that were shown at a resolution of 800x600x24 bits. Phenomenal quality. After several more pictures, slideshow and animations, Eddie introduced us to the totally undocumented paint program that comes with the board. The paint program itself is apparently full featured, but has zero documentation and therefore a reasonably steep learning curve. Macro Systems will apparently rectify this problem as soon as the manual is written!

Thanks, Eddie for the excellent demonstration of an amazing piece of equipment for the AMIGA.

This month was an unusual month for the Loop chapter, since we actually had some door prizes... David Owens brought these in and they were won by the following LUCKY people... Doug Gaudin won Beginners' Guide to the Amiga, John Malmstrom won Pinball Dreams, Fred Ramsey won Compute's Basic and Frank Stith won TV Sports Football. Congrats to all our winners and thanks to our now Ex-president for the prizes.

Well, that's it for this month. We hope to see you at our next meeting of the Amiga By-The-Loop.

## Amiga Central Johnny Kitchens

It's holiday time! At least it was. By the time you read this two holidays will have come and gone. The two biggest holidays of all. Now we can look forward to the doldrums of holiday time. Oh well, Memorial Day will get here eventually!

This month's meeting started with an election of chapter officers.

Our question and answer session took off as usual. It went so high that I thought we were never coming back. Confusion over Baud Bandit led the way. The name seems to be popping up on several related pieces of software. I'm still not sure we cleared it up. What is and how do you make a brush followed. I believe we had more success in clearing that up. What followed next I believe was the longest discussion of my memory. The question was on 2.1 fonts, in particular bit mapped fonts. By the time we finished that, everything that was font related had been discussed. If you had any questions on fonts, you should have been there - we probably covered it! A question of the future of Commodore and the Amiga came next. I'm not sure anyone has an answer to that. Next came the second longest discussion I can remember. CDROMs brought about discussions that, at times, actually had everyone talking. This was one involved group! Hard drive problems stirred up a group of solutions. In the past monitors and what to get have brought up a few discussions. News of a new monitor from NEC helped give some of us something to think about. NEC has introduced an all new 3PG. This multisync monitor syncs down to the required 15.5KHz needed for some Amiga users. There is a catch though. It's a 27" screen! This monitor has connectors for everything you could want to connect to a monitor and it even has a remote control. Sounds like the ultimate presentation monitor.

After a very close and exciting election, we installed Scott Lamb as President, Harold Williams as Vice President, Johnny Kitchens as Secretary, Bill Raecke as Treasurer, and Ned Kelly as Librarian. I wish a warm welcome to Scott Lamb as new member of our executive team. With this most important of club activities ended we proceeded with the usual.

Our main presentation, was

## CHAPTER NEWS

GVP's Phone Pak. Ned Kelly made the presentation. GVP ought to hire him! His presentation did more for explaining this product than all of the ads GVP has ever printed. I'm sure several people considered getting Phone Pak after seeing this demo. Phone Pak answered the phone, performed a type of caller ID, turned on lights, gave the time, performed voice mail functions, and seemed to provide capabilities only limited by your imagination. If you missed this meeting, sorry - you missed a lot!

For January we are scheduled to see Final Writer, a new version of Final Copy.

## Metro C-64/128 Brenda Sessums

Hello, Metro C-64/128 Users! Yep, that's the name, don't wear it out! That name may seem like a mouth full, but it really lets people know what our chapter is all about.

Sixteen funloving people were greeted at our December meeting with a myriad of Christmas music and merriment. Jo Lynn's 128 was running a "Christmas Album" (which included happy, dancing skeletons), and Phil Heberer's 128 was running

Christmasy, but Mike couldn't find his Christmas disk!)

The Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, TCOM for short, really did us a great service at the last meeting. As soon as you entered the door, there was a noticeable change from previous months. Not a hand-drawn sign, but a monitor giving information on where and what time our chapter was meeting - in full color! It was just like those information monitors at DFW airport, but of course had more important information on it!

As you probably already guessed, "Metro C-64/128" is the new chapter name voted in during the last meeting. The other name in the top two was "Itty Bitty 8 Bitters". "The Pink Panthers" didn't quite make it to the top two.

It is official... we all decided to buy a club subscription to C-64 Alive!, the disk magazine Phil has non-members $2 per issue. Not a bad deal.

Phil passed around a fabulous newsletter he created for Commodore Country. It was created with FontMaster 128 and the Fun Graphics Machine. It looked very professional, with clip art, slick headers, and nice text.

Is there a question you want answered, or a program you need help with for your computer? Maybe a class you would like to see given to make you harper than you already are? Impossible, you say. But no, those are just the things Phil or Jo Lynn want you to let them know for ideas on upcoming meetings. You have the question or need, and they will try to find the answer, or create a how-to session for it. And all at no additional charge! (As long as your MCCC dues are up to date, that is!) Those who took survey forms last month, please fill them out and bring

"SID/PIC V 2.5" (starting off with "The Twelve Days of Christmas"). Of course, Mike Sessums' Baby (SX-64) had the very Christmasy "Little Computer People". (OK, LCP isn't been telling everyone about. It is a little different format than Loadstar, but it's great! The disk will be available FREE (oooh, that's cheap!) to chapter members, but will cost

them to the next meeting, or give them to any of the chapter officers.

By the way, what are you doing with your computer? Especially your 64? Phil said since he works mostly in 128 mode (actually, his computer, not him), he doesn't see a lot of the C-64 programs. Since he is doing quite a bit of the demos, he concentrates mostly on the 128, but would also like to see what people do with the 64. Just give Phil a call, or let him know at the next meeting.

Phil demonstrated the "Northwest Training Kit," by the

## CHAPTER NEWS

Northwest Users Group. It graphically shows you how to use your computer and how it works inside. It is really handy for first time users, and pretty nifty for the rest of us, too. It is available for checkout by club members.

Barbara Posten showed us an RF modulator Radio Shack sold her for about $30. They told her that was what she needed to hook her C64 up to a TV! Since the C-64 has an RF modulator built-in, we took the part back to RS and got the $2 part

Rick Sealy brought his new 128D that he was having trouble with. Phil thought it might be a Jiffy Dos problem, but it turned out to be an internal problem. Commodore Country received a bunch of the 128Ds direct from Commodore, but they were all shipped without manuals! Things haven't changed much, have they?

to use your 1571 in 1541 mode.) The cable plugs directly into the PC's printer port. While you still can't run C-64 or 128 programs on the PC, you can transfer files between the Commodore drive and the PC. This could be helpful if you've got a text file on your PC, but you want to put it into a C-64/128 word processor. No retyping needed! Or if your modem is on your IBM PC and you download C-64/128 files, you can easily put them on a disk your little 8-bit computer can use! Mike said the cable could be built for well under $20.

Bill Marsden and Mike News from the North Dallas Commodore Club came by to demo a couple of their creations for our computers. Mike showed us "Zounds 2.01" , a public domain program that works with a board that plugs into the cartridge port. Zounds lets you digitize sounds directly into your computer with an RCA cable and a board he designed. Mike sells the Zounds kit for about $10, which includes parts and a special circuit board you put together. He donated several disks to our chapter which has digitized sounds like "I've fallen, and I can't get up," "Good Morning Viet Nam," and HAL saying "I'm completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly." If you like giving your SID chip a workout, you really need these disks! (You don't need the Zounds board to play the sounds, only to record new ones.)

Mike also demonstrated an X1541 cable that lets you connect your 1541 disk drive to an IBM PCcompatible. (You should also be able

If you missed the December meeting, you missed some great munchies, friendship, and excitement. John and Julia Sookma had some beautiful photos of their African Safari. They stayed in 5-Star tents while on Safari. They said it really wasn't what was expected. Out in the middle of no-where, individual tents were set up that resembled fine hotel rooms on the inside. They had running water, full baths and beautiful furniture. The campsites even had a swimming pool!

One of the highlights of the meeting became Mr. Smith, a little computer people, who lives in Mike and Brenda's SX-64. While other things were going on, club members

would wander over to write letters to Mr. Smith, pat him on the head, or call in some food for him and his dog. John Sookma had Mr. Smith get some firewood and start a fire in the fireplace. Smith had a great time at the meeting and showed off a lot. He played the piano elegantly (including a little Boogie Woogie) and put on a record to dance by. Boy, could he shake his bootie! John told him it was time for bed, so Smith put on his pajamas. Smith did two wonderful things that got everyone really excited. First, he put a pot on the stove and made a little snack in the kitchen. But then, he did the most unbelievable thing - he took a bath!!! Wow, oh boy, and oooooh! (No bare tooshies, though. After all, this is a family game!) He quickly popped into the tub from the water closet, sat happily bathing with the shower head on, and just as quickly popped back into the WC. Where else could you get such a thrill?

And just when you thought it couldn't get any better than this, we had door prizes (some provided by Commodore Country). Dale Worthy won a great game called Elite from a British company called Firebird. Bob Burt won Mirage Word Processor Professional. Mary Louise won MultiPlan, a well-known spreadsheet program. And Barbara Posten one an exciting 3.5" disk holder. (And since she has all those 3.5" disks NOT — we will try to get it exchanged for a more appropriate prize.)

Well, that's all for now. Join us in January for more fun!

A big gold star goes to Kay-Bee Toys at Rigmar Mall this month. They had several C-64 games on sale for about $6 each during December. They had Bubble Ghost (a game that is still very popular on Nintendo and Gameboy), Blue Angels (Naval flight simulator) and several sports games (basketball, tennis and football). Call the Kay-Bee Toy store in your area to see if they still have some left!
