## CBM Liquidates

Commodore is gone — how about Amiga? by Bill Raecke t's not news anymore, but if you've been out of touch for a while, Commodore International Ltd. and its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Ltd. have been placed into voluntary liquidation as of April 29. Translation: they're history. There's been a lot of discussion as to what this really means. After all, there are other Commodore companies in Europe and elsewhere not covered by the press releases. I'm no expert in kind of thing, but I'll be surprised if any of these other companies takes over development and marketing of our machines. Sales have been slumping of late, even in Great Britain and Germany - and CD-32 didn't provide the kind of spontaneous push the company was hoping for.

We all know what the problem is/was: Lack of advertising. According to the Associated Press: 'This is a company that briefly captured the attention of the American market and didn't go where the market was going,' said David Coursey, editor of the newsletter P.C. Letter in San Mateo, Calif. "They just never managed to change with the marketplace." Spoken with the calm assurance of someone who has never seen an Amiga, let alone operated one. It's true that the Amiga didn't follow where the market was going...that would have been too big a step backward for the machine we love. When the Amiga was released back in 1985 it surpassed every other computer on the market. Its 4096 colors were 4080 more than the competition. Its built-in sound surpassed anything else available. And its elegant, intuitive, fast, multi-tasking operating system wasn't even a dream for the competition. Today, nearly nine years later, the Amiga comes with what is now the standard for the industry — 16,384,000 colors - though without a true 24bit display. The competition caught up on graphic capabilities. And the Amiga sound system is no longer the competition caught up with us on sound as well. Does that make us second best? Not by a long shot. After all, we can still add a graphics card (as the competition does) to give us the display we want and we can add a sound card (as the competition does) if we need better sound performance than the standard.

But, you know what? None of our competitors can add a card that gives them the "elegant, intuitive, fast, multi-tasking operating system" we have been enjoying for years. It's true that our operating system is not the same one we started out with nine years ago, but speaking as one who has an A1000 sitting on the desk next to me right now and who uses a 386 Windows (Windoze) machine at work every day I can tell you that Windows can't come close to my 9-year old Amiga, much less a new one. Windows is slow, clumsy, and a memory and disk hog. It only multitasks in its dreams. Of course there's Windows NT and OS/2 if you've money to burn and if you don't mind the (lack of) speed. I'm not out to bash the other computers - I'm only trying to point out that the Amiga didn't die because it "never managed to change with the marketplace." Seems to me the marketplace has spent the last nine years trying to catch up, even if they didn't realize that's what they were doing. The Amiga died for one one reason and one reason only: the lack of advertising. CBM always seemed to believe that having the best computer on the market would be enough. People would naturally find out about it through osmosis. And every time one of their many presidents began to bring the Amiga out of the closet and into the light of day, our beloved Irving Gould would fire him. Mismanagement of classic proportions.

That said, where does that leave us? As a club, we'll be here as long as there is sufficient interest to keep things going. I, for one, will continue to use my Amiga until one of the competing machines fully catches up. When that happens, if I'm still into computing for a hobby, I'll be moving on. Based on what I've seen, that's at least several years off.

Of course, I'm assuming that the Amiga is really dead (in the sense that it won't be marketed or developed any more). That may not be true. It's difficult to believe

## Silicon Studio Tour

pretty slick if you can afford it by Legrande Blount

W 'ell, I did it. I saw the alternative to the Amiga in the world of Video. Silicon Graphics is probably one of the strongest growing companies in the US. That was point number one at the Silicon tour that I attended in Dallas on 10 May. For anyone considering one of these high-powered Indy or Indigo 2 work stations, you better have a healthy cash flow to justify it.

First let me address the architecture. These systems were originally designed around an R4000 RISC Processor clocking at 100 MHZ, using a 64 bit data path, and a specialized Graphics engine exclusively for rendering. (Sound vaguely familiar?) The graphics engine is unique because a low-end Indy will actually render as fast as the next up Indigo2. The high end model can actually render in real time. Recently the chip was upgraded to the R4400 and now clocks at 150 MHz. The underlying operating system is called Irix, which is SGT's "proprietary" version of Unix. The marketing types hemmed and hawed about whether standard Unix programs would work. An engineer finally conceded that other programs that are Unix BSD/ATT compliant and were compiled for the R4400 should work. How many of those exist? So any software you get for this machine had better say "Irix 5.2 and SGI Indy / Indigo" or it probably won't work properly.

The availability of over 55 companies committing to software support for the SGI platform did not go un heralded. Additionally, a broad range of hardware manufacturers are making products as well. The most telling question however was asked by yours truly. The previous low end SGI model was the "Personal Iris, introduced in 1988. I asked, "Using the Personal Iris as an example, could you elaborate on SI's commitment to continued hardware upgrade and software support?" The answer came after much throttling of the marketing guy and others. Since SGI has changed architecture they will not develop Irix 5.2 for previous models. Most of the software companies were requiring the latest version of the operating system to work. So even with the fact that technology is moving ahead faster each year, expect SGI to quit supporting these platforms 6 years after introduction.

Can it do 3D animation and rendering better than any other platform? Yes. Can it lay down a very stable signal to video? Probably. I never saw the scope. Is this the cutting edge, film or better quality, high speed, intuitive interface? Yes. Is it a bit expensive for a system that will be a boat anchor in 6 years? Full systems to do video clips (very good video clips) range from $35,000 to $45,000 (list). That includes everything for the computer, storage, and display. Assuming you had no other overhead than an office, desk and one of these stations, you'd have to be raking in $1000 a week to justify one of these assuming you have all the video equipment. Not a semi-pro level of cash flow. (Statistics available on request.)

SGI is a company succeeding in selling to upper end users at a premium. This attempt to bring their product to greater volume is admirable indeed and some companies will be able to afford these computer systems. For a small guy, which I am assuming this article is aimed at, to commit a large volume of cash, that hell amortize over the 6 year life span of the Indy, requires a trust of huge proportion. He'll be committing totally to a product that requires pricey hardware, pricey software, and the really neat stuff comes in progressive module #4. (Alias PowerAnimator V5 ... $15K (basic) ... $15K (Adv Anim) ... $15K (Adv Model) ... $? (PowerTracer) ... $? (PowerCaster)).

The Amiga XXXX and IBM/Mac PowerPC have the RISC architecture. The bus width isn't as great, the interface isn't as smooth but the price for a complete system with massive outside support and numerous third parties developing is much lower. Additionally, in 2 years the speed will be better, the software just as powerful, and the price will be at the point a Semi-Pro can justify. You'll also be able to use it for other activities and could sell it quickly if your dream becomes a nightmare. Here is a time when you'll actually read it. "Now is a time to wait, not buy."

## Amiga Reborn? continued from page 1

that a computer as advanced as this could just fade away. All we know at this point is that Commodore is in liquidation. There are rumors galore about an Asian company (Samsung is the current favorite) buying the rights to the Amiga. Rumor has it that they have every intention of marketing the full Amiga line. And there is a movement by developers to buy the rights. I hope that one of the options pans out. But I further hope that if the Amiga is marketed by a new company, they continue to develop it. A stagnant Amiga will be passed up in the marketplace within a few years doing little for any of us. Most of all I hope that, if the Amiga is marketed by a new company, they MARKET it. Spell that advertising.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke he disk count is up again this month (sorry Ned). Twenty-one MCCC disks full of neat stuff that I'm sure you can't live without. And with twenty-five new Fish disks as well, this month should keep you busy for a while.

## LacePointer by Nico Francois

This is one of those programs that does nothing useful whatsoever. Nothing useful, that is, unless you consider making your computer look better to be a useful function. All it does is interlace your pointer so that it's smaller and not nearly as blocky. It's still low-res interlaced, so it's not quite as clean as it might be, but it's a HUGE improvement. Even better, I've been using it for about a month now and have had no ill-effects at all other than an occasional squashedlooking pointer in programs that use their own pointer

gadget is that you can't see the full list of possibilities. You only see one at a time. After you have gone through the choices a couple of times, it's usually possible to stop at the correct choice. CycleToMenu improves that process. After installing the program, clicking on a cycle gadget will cause a menu to drop down from the gadget showing the full list of possibilities. Selection is now much simpler. This is version 2.0 of CycleToMenu which now includes a

![Image](1994_06_artifacts/image_000001_ba9fb423740a9d1c88746d31aa35c7a40274681d50767eaa5d102ddeba02dc71.png)

designs (such as Deluxe Paint and PageStream). LacePointer is on MCCC-A\_693.

## CycleToMenu by Frederico Giannici

Like LacePointer, CycleToMenu modifies your system. Unlike LacePointer, however, CycleToMenu does more than just make things look better. It modifies the cycle gadgets. A cycle gadget is one of those gadgets that has some text in it and a circular-shaped arrow to the left of the text. As you click on it, the text in the gadget changes to indicate your current selection from the list of possibilities available. The problem with that kind of a lot of customizing features so that your cycle gadgets can operate and look just the way you want them to. It's on MCCC-A\_703.

## Tracker Music

Pickin's are better than last month. There are fortyone tunes spread over nine disks. My picks for the month are Overture on MCCC-A\_695, Slow Motion on MCCC-A\_696, Blues and Lunatic on MCCC-A\_703, Detskal on MCCC-A\_705, and Sound-o-da-Lun on MCCC-A\_709.

## Deluxe Galaga by Edgar M. Vigdal

![Image](1994_06_artifacts/image_000002_0fa184e2b4914e2f50425d4c6047b943653f11e5f9152f5a89d942ce40338caf.png)

Keeping up with the latest version of Deluxe Galaga? If not, you certainly should be. This is one of the best games available. The version this month is 1.9. A couple of new weapons have been added as well as some smaller new functions. This is on MCCC-A 697. By the way, there is a version 2.0 floating around. If you run across it, get rid of it. It's a hacked-up modification of 1.9 and is not a real release.

So far as I can tell, there is nothing dangerous (no viruses) in the hack, but there are no advantages either. Better off using the real thing.

## Virus Checker by John Veldthuis

Speaking of viruses, here is the latest protection. Version 6.41 fixes a bug and adds a new command. It's on MCCC-A\_697 as well.

## PicIcon by Michael J. Sheppard

Like good looking icons? Like picture icons that look like miniature representations of the pictures they are attached to? Well Picicon is a way to make this job easy. Fire up the program and an app-icon appears on the Workbench. Double-click on the icon and the preference setting window opens up. It lets you specify how big to make the icons, how many colors to use, and how to map the colors. With a 4-color Workbench, you probably want color 0 to map to Workbench color 0, etc. But if you run more colors you probably want Piclcon to try to colormatch the picture's palette as best it can. Once set, the preferences can be saved as defaults. To use, you simply drop the icon of a picture on the app-icon. In a few seconds, the icon is replaced by one that looks like the picture. This isn't the best way of making icons like this (Art Department Professional does a better job), but it certainly is the easiest and cheapest. Piclcon can be found this month on MCCC-A\_700.

## LhA.dopus by Michiel Pelt

LhA.dopus isn't even a stand-alone program. It's an ARexx program designed to be used with Directory Opus. But it's one of those programs that I should have written myself. Click on an LhA archive, then activate the LhA.dopus script. The contents of the archive appear in the directory window along with some commands. Double-click on a file name, or click on several files and select ExtractSelected from the commands at the top of the window, and the selected files are extracted from the archive. What LhA.dopus provides is a better way to examine the contents of an archive and a MUCH better way to selectively extract files. It's on MCCC-A\_701.

## GuidePrefs by Bart Vanhaeren

When Commodore released AmigaGuide, it was a major advancement for our computers. We now have hypertext in a standard format at our fingertips. Along with the release was some information about setting environment variables to configure AmigaGuide to our individual liking. This works fine, but the Amiga is supposed to be more "intuitive" than that. All our system preferences are set through environment variables, but for other system settings we have

preferences programs to make things easier. When AmigaGuide was released, Commodore forgot to provide a preferences program. Well here it is, at long last. Commodore didn't release it, of course, but we'll take these tools where we can find them. Where you can find this one is on MCCC-A\_711.

## Magic Workbench Backgrounds by Torsten Hiddessen

Anyone using Magic Workbench colors? If so, you might be interested in this collection of 10 brushes designed to be used as Workbench backgrounds with that color scheme. They are beautifully done. I even modified a few of them to use with my own Workbench color scheme. Check out MCCC-A\_712.

## Insite Floptical Drive

a Usenet review by Allan G. Lawrie he Insite Floptical Drive I325VM is a 3.5 inch magnetic recording and laser tracking to store 21 MB on a floppy disk. It is a cheap alternative to optical drives.

## LIST PRICE

$825.00(NZ) is what I paid for a bare drive.

$1100.00(NZ) is the approximate price for a Floptical kit.

$42.75(NZ) per 21 meg disk is the best I have found.

All prices are in New Zealand dollars and include GST. Estimated prices in US dollars are half those shown above.

## SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

## HARDWARE

Amiga SCSI controller. Large to small power plug adaptor.

Optional: 3 1/2 mounting kit.

## SOFTWARE

Insite drive unlock utility. (Available on aminet)

Hard drive formating software.

Workbench 1.3 minimum. (1.3 and 2.1 tested)

## MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

Amiga 2000, 1MB Chip RAM, 2MB Fast RAM. ECS Agnus chip. OCS Denise chip. Commodore 2091 SCSI controller. Xetec FastTrack SCSI controller.

AmigaDOS 1.3 / 2.1

## INSTALLATION

The Floptical drive will install in any 3 1/2 inch bay, but its faceplate is standard PC size. Installation is the same as a hard drive with the following exceptions:

1. The drive is protected by a thin tin cover, so some care is necessary.
2. The power plug is smaller than standard, and an adaptor is required.
3. As it uses floppy disks, there has to be external access to the front panel.
4. Insert the "insite" command early in the startupsequence, but after "Binddrivers" and any other hard drive initialising software.

As I received a bare drive, the SCSI address jumpering was a hit-and-miss affair. I settled on address 4 after some experimentation.

## REVIEW

The first noticeable thing when booting with a Floptical is the time it takes for the drive to check a disk. It goes "clunk-clonk" and whirs a bit, reminiscent of a sick floppy drive. Both controllers take a bit of time to notice the drive when booting as it doesn't respond for about 1015 seconds. This may cause problems with other controllers.

Before you can do ANY writing to the drive, a utility is needed to send a "write sense enable" to the drive. Even low-level formatting cannot be done without this utility. There are two available on Aminet, the best being "insite" (filename: insite.lha). There is another called "scsi" , and they both do the job. The command should be inserted in your startup-sequence AFTER Binddrivers and any other controller enabling commands. (For example, "Touchall" for Xetec controllers.)

HDTools has no problem with the floptical AFTER the "insite" utility is run. Low-level formatting takes about 20 minutes, and AmigaDOS format is about the same, accompanied by a bit of clunking. In the end, the disk has 19 Meg of usable space.

The disk acts just like a hard drive, with the exception of the write protect tab. This is the same as a floppy (on the opposite corner of the disk) and can be used to protect the disk from ALL writing. Write protected flopticals can be booted from on a virus-infected system or if something is trashing partitions (e.g., possibly some of the bugs in certain UNIX versions).

Under AmigaDOS 1.3, the DiskChange command must be run several times when changing a disk. This isn't necessary for AmigaDOS 2.0 and higher because the computer polls the drive every 5 seconds: similar to the floppy interface, but without the annoying click. The disk icon disappears and reappears in an orderly fashion. If there is no disk in the drive when booting AmigaDOS 1.3, there will be a long delay until the controller times-out waiting for a response from the floptical drive. This is very obvious with the 2091 SCSI controller.

Disk changes sometimes require a reboot to take effect. If the new disk has exactly the same partitioning as the old one, then disks can be changed without rebooting. Of course, this is not a problem if all your disks have only one partition.

MessyDOS and CrossDOS can be used to read 1.44 MB PC disks. This requires a Mountlist entry and the appropriate software. It can be done. I have not been able to format PC disks using a floptical though.

## DOCUMENTATION

I received a bare drive with NO documentation. There are kits available with all of this, which takes the guess-work out of the address jumpering. It's a SCSI device, so it shouldn't NEED much documentation.

## LIKES

## LIKES AND DISLIKES

1. The ability to store a reasonable amount of data with random access is what makes this product for me. I have 40 Meg of archive files stored away and duplicated on 4 disks.
2. Workbench fits on ONE disk. In fact several versions fit on one disk.
3. Another aspect is disaster recovery. All my important partitions are stored on a disk which I can boot from if the hard drive is killed. The hard drive can be reformatted/partitioned (or replaced) and all the data transferred back.
4. This could also be handy for UNIX users who could have a cut down system on 1 disk. Rogue software can't blow away a write protected floptical disk!

## DISLIKES

1. Initially the noise made by the drive was not to my liking. I'm used to it now.
2. The price of the disks! Initially I was charged $80 (NZ) each. Since then I have found a source for 3M Floptical disks at the price mentioned in the LIST PRICE section, above.

## DESIRED IMPROVEMENTS

1. Better Amiga support.
2. BIGGER disks.
3. A standard for the jumpers included in SCSI specifications, as this would make ANY drive simple to install.

## BUGS

The drive requires a utility to enable writing. See above.

## VENDOR SUPPORT

Their technicians know a lot about the drives and are able to repair them. They will clean the drives too, as this can not be done buy the user.

For me this was MELCO Sales (Mitsubishi ELectric COmpany). They were very helpful and replaced the whole drive when I told them that it wouldn't write. Later on they replaced a disk after I had messed it up so bad that NO controller could make sense of it. (The disk later formatted OK on one of MELCO's PC's.)

## WARNING!!!

The drive will require less cleaning (and expense) if ONLY floptical disks are used.

DO NOT CLEAN THE DRIVE WITH A CLEANING DISK.

## WARRANTY

12 months. This will probably vary.

## CONCLUSIONS

Apart from the fact that nobody from Commodore / MELCO / Insite was able to give specific help for an Amiga setup, I really like this product. The drive has performed flawlessly since I have been using it. To date I have had NO faulty blocks on any disks, including those with games on them. Games disks have received a reasonable thrashing for over a year!

The physical write protection can be used in the case of viruses and experimental software to keep a reference disk free from interference. This reference disk can even booted from while still write-protected.

The Floptical beats a tape for access and convenience, but storage is now small in comparison to other media (CD-ROM, DAT tape, and large hard drives). eely distributable as long as it remains unmodified and is not used for profit making purposes.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga Central Johnny Kitchens

With the news of April 29, it wasn't hard to imagine what would be the dominating thought for this month's meeting. What is happening? Though rumors are flying like crazy, a few seem to be more authentic than others. Apparently we are forced to wait 'till June for the whole story to come out. That means that some may know that story before they read this story, so there is little reason to go over it here.

This month's meeting opened with a question that was related to the big story of April 29. Will the club change its name? Will we? It's not necessary yet, and it will be awhile befare our club members cease to use computers with the Commodore name. Our librarian announced that we had finally received our Fred Fish CD, called the Gold Fish. This should make things a little easier for him. We then proceeded to cover some of the talk on Commodore's situation. Until the real story comes out, it's just rumors folks. Will we see 3.1? Apparently some will, according to Expert Services, if you have the Picasso II. News of upgrades came next. Final Writer moves up to 2.1. TypeSmith has a patch out. Then there is that age old question about PageStream 3.0. Just keep saying 4 to 6 weeks, folks, and you'll have the latest word The ever-decreasing hard drive prices were discussed. That is good news for every computer enthusiast. A discussion on blue lasers being used to increase CD-ROM capacity was given a very thorough discussion. Seems the better light frequency improves density.

software, and its availability was asked next. I don't think we had a good answer for that one. A mention of Metropolitan's "Amiga Day" for June 11 was given. If you like the Amiga and want to see what is new, take some time and give them a visit. They always have some bargains during these special days as well. Someone mentioned that he had cured a Power Data problem that was brought up at a previous meeting. Good for him! I had promised to keep you up to date on the Fastlane a friend of mine bought from the club librarian. It's getting better. They sent him a new ROM which would take care of all but one problem, and said that would be fixed in the next ROM due out soon. They've been really helpful with him, and I must say he is really pleased with the card. More later as I get it.

Scoit Lamb gave a rousing speech reminding us that our Amiga is still a very viable system, and should be for quite some time! A question on Microware "OSK"

If you have some free time June 16, come on out. By then we should know answers to the big story of April 29! The meeting will feature a talk by David Johnson and Ken Purcell. They will be demonstrating Interactive Training using the Amiga. The primary tool they are using for creating these multimedia training programs is INOVAtronics' Can.Do.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

The biggest item of news discussed at this meeting of the "Metroplex Samsung / HP / Phillips / Sony / Whatever Computer Club" was, of course, the Fall of Commodore. As this has probably been thoroughly documented elsewhere, I'll only say we are all concerned and regret its passing. Did you know C= started out as a typewriter repair shop (I'm told)? And look what they did to lead the way in sound and graphics and all the rest. Perhaps one of the above will come to the rescue and not let the Amiga die in obsolescence and obscurity.

Tidbytes: CompUSA is supposedly selling Unix Amiga machines at closeout prices. Egor reported that he almost paid for the PageStream 3 upgrade... until he found out what he was "buying" was a spot on the waiting list. It's still out there in "codeland" somewhere, it seems. There was some discussion again on encryption programs, including a "PGP" program by Phil Zimmerman that even our own government can't break, which apparently has them worried! (It's OK to keep secrets as long as Uncle Sam can peek whenever he feels the need...) Hey, check out the classes M?CC is offering at the Richardson Civic Center on Workbench and Telecomm! Our best brains are offering you a chance to benefit from their experience. Find more info elsewhere here.

Speaking of Best Brains and shared experience, the venerable Bill Raecke (Webster sez that means dignified and worthy of reverence, not necessarily OLD, Bill!) offered the evening's presentation on assorted 2.0 Workbench Utility Programs. First mentioned was "Nickprefs", which gives you access to assorted speciality preferences. A

Our main presentation tonight was Calagari, and we had the pleasure of seeing Jerry Smith at the controls. Calagari is one of the Amiga's 3D rendering programs that helps make the Amiga so special. Graphics have always been a strong point for the Amiga and anything that takes advantage of it can really wow the onlookers. This demo was no exception. I want to thank Jerry Smith for dragging his equipment out to our meeting and showing off its power as well as his control over it. Too bad we couldn't convince him to donate that 4000 as a door prize. Speaking of door prizes, Scott Lamb and Harold Williams managed to gather up 6 door prizes. Heck, there were enough that even I won one!

## CHAPTER NEWS

floppy function lets you turn off the pesky click, along with "a whole bunch of stuff you shouldn't mess with." "BusyPointer" lets you design an animated pointer (variable number of frames) or select one of many supplied. Your design can be set as default or stored. "WBpicture" lets you pick a new background for Workbench.

the top bar options wherever your mouse happens to be.

Next on the menu was the "QMouse" utility, which handles a variable-timeout mouseblanker and several who's-on-top window handling features. Requesters appear on the front screen; whatever window's on top is automatically made active; a set number of clicks on a background window will force it to front, no matter how far under it may be, etc. According to Bill, this gets rid of several nagging irritations and makes things work "the way the system should'have been designed."

"ToolManager" lets you add items to the Workbench Tool Menu that you consider handy "tools." An icon that causes a "tool" to be run can be "dropped" onto ToolManager and a menu entry may be created that will call in this object. The program also allows "hot keys" to be created to call in a Cll, etc.

Another goodie was "PicIcon", which can make colored icons out of picture files. Art Department does it better, sez Bill, but this one's cheaper! I was impressed by its ability to try to adapt the image as closely as possible using the existing color palette rather than its original colors, if desired.

"Tools Daemon" goes further, offering additional menus as well as submenus. Each menu item adds a small amount to memory usage. I can think of a lot of things I frequently get to via click-click, [wait], click-click, [wait], click-click that I would love to get to via clickpull-GO! Another menu-related critter was "Magic Menu" which "prettifies" your menus and can give you a quick-access pop-up menu of

We heard about "YASS" (Yet Another Screen Shuffler) which gives you a list of currently active screens or windows to select from, and "Window Shuffle" which lets you page through active windows easily. The "ARQ" application makes your requesters look nice, with centered, animated images replacing the standard fare. The ol' "confirm delete" requester shows you a little Earth that slowly disappears... with THAT grim reminder, you'll think twice before saying "OK"! And the "Guru" message has a little Amiga that morphs into a skull-andcrossbones. Teehee!

Bill brought disks for copying all these nifty things, which are all Public Domain/Shareware software. Most are also available in our library. Check it out!

Yes, we had doorprizes! Due to the unstable situation in the Amiga market, our dealers may be unable to match their past generosity in the near future, but our own President came through with treats! Danny Barnett offered "Future Classics" from LiveStudios, 5 games in one, (won by William Dockendorf), and "Deep Space" by Psygnosis (won by Don Sobiek). Thanks, Danny! Our V.P. Steve reported he was "in negotiation" for one of two possible presenters for June, but the July main attraction is confirmed. Wait 'n' see! See you there!

## Metro C-64/128 Brenda Sessums

Buenos dias, Metro C-64/128 Users! Fifteen lucky people participated in our May meeting, including Roger Kromer, a new member. . We now have over 30 members in the chapter! By the way, last month's attendance was 21 instead of 19. Sorry about the misprint!

Our May meeting opened with brisk discussions of the Commodore bankruptcy. Some hearsay claims that there is a Japanese Company buying Commodore International (US), France, and Spain. One member jokingly asked, "when Commodore goes bankrupt, do all of your disks automatically go blank?" As you've probably heard by now (and if not, we just mentioned it), Commodore International has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. What does that mean for us 8-bitters? Absolutely nothing! We haven't had corporate support for many years, and yet the 64s and 128s are still going strong all over the world. In fact, Commodore Germany and Commodore U.K. reportedly are still going strong, in spite of Commodore s U.S. problems. Of course, they have the advertising power and marketing know-how to keep the machines out in the consumer's eye (unlike Commodore U.S.)!

NEW SOFTWARE, NEW SOFTWARE, NEW SOFTWARE!!! That's right, you can add another company to the list of those who are making new software for the Commodore 64! Titus Software Corporation in California has several new titles which will be sold through Commodore Country in Burleson. That's right - from the good ol' U.S.A., for a change. Software currently on order are "Crazy Cars" "Crazy Cars 3", "Blues Brothers" "Swap", "F40 Pursuit Simulator" "Titan", "Fire and Forget", and "Wild Streets". Many of these titles are already in at Commodore Country. Titus ships their C-64 and Amiga software to England, and Commodore Country has been ordering their new software from England. Well, Titus found out about this from their British contacts and faxed Commodore Country a list of their current titles. The C-64 and 128s just keep going, and going, and going...

## CHAPTER NEWS

And speaking of C-64 support, Commodore Format reports that there are 24 new releases scheduled for release in 1994. Two companies in Britain that are doing just that are Psytronik and Parallel Logic. Psytronik will soon release "Archetype", , "Cops 3", "The Last Amazon". ", and "PsykoZone". Other C64 titles in development are "Last Amazon 2" ", "Trojahn", "Flight of the Albatross" , "Cops Fight Back" "Insectophobia" (is that like "Arachnaphobia"?), and "Cosmic Combat". . Also in development are "Everwar", "Fighting Cops" and"Project Argus" . Parallel Logic has developed a window-driven utility package for the C-64 called "Util 1541". The next issue of "Commodore Format" will have a review of this software. They are also planning, six games for release in

Alive!" disk magazine? It's packed with great C-64 goodies again this month. A printout of a cartoon female feline from this issue says, "I went out with a NAVY ship's CAT last night. He was an OFFICER too. Said he was COMMODORE COMPUTER. That's a funny last name. I HOPE he was telling me the TRUTH!" Don't forget to get your copy of "C-64 Alive!" since it is free with your MCCC club membership.

Do you have a special program you've been working on for the C-64? Well, Commodore Format reports that Ultra Software, a U.K. mail order firm, is looking for new software to market from people just like you! Their motto is "Support the 8-Bits". You can also get a full software list by writing to Ultra, Fulling Mill, Broughton, Banbury, Oxon, OX15 6AP. Their phone is (0295) 730060.

To find out more about these new developments, get free software for your C-64, receive reviews on new and existing programs, and even more, pick up your copy of "Commodore Format" from Commodore Country in Burleson. Remember, to keep support for your Commodore, keep supporting the Commodore dealers and software houses! That support comes locally from Software Etc. in Allen at (214) 736-3107, and Commodore Country in Burleson at (817) 295-7658. Also, Commodore Country gives club discounts.

Say members, have you received your copy of the new "C-64

If you have been thinking about connecting to the rest of the world with a modem and your computer, you will find many BBS numbers in "Texas Computing". BBS numbers are listed in the back of the tabloid-sized magazine. Look for "F" in the codes by the BBS names to get "FidoNet" access. This will let you send and receive mail through several interest groups. Formerly "Computer Currents" "Texas Computing" is free at newstands, some bookstores, and many C-64/128 User's group meetings. Phil has BBS numbers and is available for modem help.

Epson. Phil demonstrated "EasyLoader" , a quick menu loading program on the 128 ramlink. This is a shareware program which you can get from Phil. Phil demonstrated a modem program called "NovaTerm". Jo Lynn quickly demonstrated several programs on Disk #562. One was "High Rollers", a dice game for the 128. Jo Lynn demonstrated "Rush Hour" on disk #553. It is like "Frogger" , but you move a person across several lanes of traffic and try to pick up bags of cash, without becoming grease spots on the pavement. A very strange game called "Octopus" was on the same disk. Also, there is the old stand-by "Battleship" by J. Butterfield. This one is excellent and resembles the original board game. "Puzzle Maze" looks like "Packman", but you get busted by the cops when breaking out of jail!

John Burt recommended "Gary's Labels V3" on disk #250 (that's what the book said, but is it 146?). John said that you can put "PrintShop" graphics on address labels you make. (See Print Shop Art disks 274, 277, 279 and others). However, this will not work on the 1525 printer. It has output for Epson emulation like for Epsons, Stars, and other printers that can emulate an

Mary Louise Hagemeyer needs the March issue of the newsletter to complete her collection. If you let your membership lapse, you don't get your newsletters and are cut off from society (No, no, I meant you are cut off from valuable information you might really need. Well, at least you might miss some good gossip!).

Jo Lynn began forming a list of people who want to carpool or convoy to 1st Saturday in Dallas.

This month's door prizes were provided by Mary Louise from her winnings of last month from Commodore Country. Here are the lucky winners: Hershel Hoover got "Gorf", Clyde Masey won "Geos 64" and Leonard Bowser got a payoff with "Home Accountant"

Next month, Jack Tarvin plans on giving a presentation on "Print Shop" " the fun and easy card, banner and sign maker. Brenda Sessums may give a presentation on one of the games that came free with "Commodore Format" magazine. There's probably more in store, so don't miss the next one!
