## A Tale of Two Adapters

it is a far, far, better thing... by Ned Kelly n January of 1993 I upgraded from an Amiga 2000 to 11,o or the at are on tea, Bar the one thing. power of the A4000 are wonderful, but the one thing the A4000 had always lacked was a good SCSl interface. The Nexus adapter that I had on my A2000 would not work on the A4000, and my ears perked up whenever the subject of adapters for the A4000 came up. One problem I faced was that having one of the first A4000s also meant that I had one with a Buster 9 chip which was soldered onto the mother board. The A4091 which Commodore was working on was of interest but did not seem workable due to its requirement of a Buster 11 chip and the fact that motherboard replacements seemed impossible to get.

I had heard some good things about an adapter out of Germany which would work with either the Buster 9 or 11 chip. So in October of 1993 I acquired a Fastlane Z3 SCSI-2 adapter, a Segate model ST11200N SCSI-2 hard disk, and a Wangtek model 6130-HS SCSI-2 digital audio tape backup system. With all of this I now had the perfect system. I eagerly took it all home and went to work installing it.

The first thing that surprised me when I unpacked the Fastlane is that the board was completely full. There was no room on it for mounting a hard disk as there was on every other adapter I had ever seen. The reason for this is about two thirds of the board is occupied by 16 slots for SIMM memory modules. The board will accomidate either 4 or 16 megabyte SIMMs for a total memory size of either 64 or 256 megabytes.

After installing the Fastlane Z3 and my Segate hard disk I was anxious to get up and running with an extra gigabyte of disk space. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case. The software that came with the Fastlane Z3 recognized that the adapter was there and that the Seagate was connected to it, but that's as far is it went. Whenever I attempted to configure the drive, I would get a message saying that this was not allowed on an empty device. The Fastlane Z3 is supported by the Advanced Systems &amp; Software International Group located in Dallas. I talked with them about this and learned that the adapter thought that 1 had a removable device like a SyQuest with no media inserted and that's why it was saying that it was empty. I also learned that I was not the only one having problems like this with very large hard disks, and they assured me that they were working on it.

I had a second SCSI-2 device on hand in the form of my Wangtek. I decided to give it a try. I had been assured that this device had been tested with the Fastlane Z3 and worked fine. After connecting it and powering on my system the adapter was present and it recognized that there was a Wangtek connected to it, but I could not get the Wangtek to function.

The problems appeared to be in the Z3.scsi. device driver which was in a socketed chip on the board. A few weeks later I acquired a new device driver in software. So I pulled the chip off the board, loaded the driver into my DEVS: drawer, and tried again. The results were the same. A few weeks later I received a new driver, but this time it was an actual chip. So I installed it on the board, removed the software driver from my DEVS: drawer, and tried again. The results were the same. A few weeks later they decided that possibly I had a defective board. So we swapped boards, I installed the new one, and tried again. The results were again the same.

By this time I was very frustrated and I happened to see the Commodore/DKB A4091 adapter on the shelves and inquired about it. I would still need the new Buster 11 chip which I did not have, but I was told that new motherboards did trickle in from time to time. So I put my name on the waiting list for a motherboard replacement and waited. About three weeks later I got a call saying that the motherboards were in and to bring in my A4000. I took the A4000 in and picked up a A4091 the same day. The machine was ready for me to pick up the

next day.

When I got back home with the computer 1 began installation of the A4091. When I first powered up the computer, I kept getting a software failure when my userstartup script attempted to run the "Sound" program to play the HAL sound sample. I commented that out of the script and forged ahead. This adapter is like others I have seen, having room on it for mounting a hard disk. Both it and the Fastlane Z3 have a very nice feature that allows you to daisy chain the hard disk busy light from the motherboard to the adapter and finally to the light. This allows the busy light to blink at you when it is busy processing data from either the internal IDE adapter or the SCSI-2 expansion adapter. The A4091 uses Commodore's HDToolBox software for configuration purposes and with it I was able to partition my Seagate just fine. I formatted the partitions and began filling them up. 1

connected my

Wangtek tape backup

system and it too worked

fine.

I never tried the

Fastlane Z3

with my new motherboard

and Buster

11 chip.

With the flawless per-

formance of the A4091 1

saw no need to pursue it.

The Fastlane

Z3 may work just fine now

or there may still be bugs

in the device driver. I no

longer care.

In ad- dition to the

"Sound" pro- gram, I sub-

sequently found two

other pro- grams which

caused soft- ware fail-

ures. One is the PD text

viewer called

"FullView"

and the other is my Fortran compiler from Absoft. With the help of Harold Williams, the problem with all three of these programs was determined to be the well known copyback cache problem, and after disabling it my system has performed flawlessly. The thing that I do not understand though is why the copyback problem just arose. I had been running my 4000 for over a year without ever thinking about it. The only reasonable thing I can think of is that the copyback cache never worked or was never enabled with my original A4000/motherboard setup.

The statistics shown in the accompanying table give an idea of the speed of this setup. They were gathered with DiskSpeed version 4.2.

Because the Fastlane Z3 has never worked on my system, I would not recommend it. I am very pleased with the Commodore/DKB 4091 and would recommend it to anyone wanting a SCSI-2 adapter for their Amiga 4000.%

## Printing on a C64/128

24 vs 9 pin printers by Phil Heberer n a message from Rod Gasson on the Fidonet in parallel on his laser printer, I decided to try a couple of tests of my own.

I have a 24 pin Panasonic KX-P2123 printer with an internal 46k buffer (14k with optional 32K addition), and I just recently got a Centronics version of the Star NX-1000, which I use with a Xetec Super Graphix Gold interface. The Gold interface has a 32k buffer if fonts are not used. Since I have a homebrew Geo-cable compatible parallel cable, I wanted to do some comparisons on print quality and speed with the various connections and printers.

Obviously, the 24 pin printer was faster, even in 9. pin emulation mode, but I think that is partly because of newer technology than anything. I've harped on a parallel cable because of speed with GEOS, and

it DOES increase speed there. By comparison, the NX-1000 with parallel cable is slightly faster than the 24 pin connected serially. However, there is not as much gain in speed with the 24-pin con. nected parallel as I thought originally. 1 attribute that to the fast serial/burst speed the Gold interfa c e i s capable of, and the combination of 32K buffer in the Gold and 46K in the printer. The buffers take the data as fast as it can come in on the serial buss so don't have the delay as the interface buffer may have by itself.

![Image](1994_04_artifacts/image_000003_ee82f5558d0da85654567ab0b560de1a72a141da49202f6aa12babb23792806e.png)

What really surprised me more than the speed was the print quality. I have Perfect Print LQ from CMD, and printed the demo document with various setting and connections. To the naked eye, the 240x216 dpi the NX-1000 can do looks nearly identical to the 360x360 dpi the Panasonic can do. Only with a magnifying glass could I really see much difference in the two.

Using the Perfect Print system to handle sending the data to the printer via parallel cable, the NX1000 was only about half as slow as the Panasonic.

The point to all of this is just this. If you're thinking of getting a 24 pin printer for your Commodore 8-bit computer for better graphics resolution, you might reconsider. While it's true that text NLQ mode runs faster and looks better, there isn't that much of an improvement in graphics (at least with the current printer drivers I've been able to find). If you like using some of the graphics programs published for the Commodore (like PrintShop or PrintMaster etc.), you're probably better off sticking with a good Epson emulation 9-pin printer. Nearly ALL Commodore C64/128 programs support the 9-pin Epson in some fashion. Finding one program, other than a word processor, that works well with the 24-pin printer — even in 9-pin emulation mode, is quite another matter. The highest quality printouts on the 9 pin are quite slow, with multiple passes per line, but if you're only going to do one master copy, then photo-copy any other copies you need, a 24-pin printer is hardly worth the extra expense. Besides, there are a number of real bargains on used 9-pin printers in local pawn shops, flea markets, local FOR-SALE echos, etc.

I just thought I'd pass on a little of my experiences in case any of you might be considering a printer upgrade. If you have an Epson emulating printer that is capable of 240x216 bit-mapped graphics, you may have all the printer you really need. Now, if you're wanting to upgrade to a laser printer, that's another matter! I guess as soon as I win the Texas Lottery, I'll have a laser printer capable of 600×600 dpi (or higher). &lt; grin»

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke wenty-two. That's how many new MCCC disks good stuff, too. Let's get right to it.

## ClipArt

Last month we added quite a bit of clipart to the library. This month we add even more. You'll find excellent it on MCCC-A\_657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672 and 673. Twelve of those disks are FULL of clipart. And, as was true last month, the quality of this collection is high. Well worth adding to your own collection. All of the clipart in this month's newsletter comes from these disks. And what you see here doesn't begin to scratch the surface.

## JPEG-Pies

There's one excellent image on MCCC-A 673. It's a picture of some wildflowers. Lots of color and an excellent image quality. Check it out.

## Scorched Tanks by Michael Welch

Scorched Tanks is a new, improved version of the old classic game in which two opponents shoot at each other with tanks. In the classic version, the trick is to adjust the force of the charge and the trajectory of your shot in order to wipe out your opponent before you get wiped out. Scorched Tanks takes that scenario a step further by adding multiple players, defensive shields, and a variety of weapons. You can have up to four players - and each can be either human or computer controlled. Your weapons can be anything from a simple exploding shell - to laser beams — to missiles that travel underground to lava flows - to dirt bombs that bury your opponents. The trick is to have the correct weapon to use at the correct time...some work better than others in certain situations. And, of course, you are not allowed to have all weapons at your disposal. You have to purchase what you think you'll need...and your money supply is limited. Unfortunately, your computer opponents are not similarly hampered, but they compensate by being less than brilliant players.

I have frittered away more time that I'd care to admit playing this game. It's quite addicting. I generally play against two computer opponents just to keep things interesting. Check it out. It's on MCCC-A -663.

## Deluxe Galaga by Edgar M. Vigdal

![Image](1994_04_artifacts/image_000004_21b8ae6ecbeb454e9283d4e84d111336e9796b0795de885164a34a237fbf866c.png)

Back in the olden days...before I had a home PC... we're going back quite a ways here...I used to play the arcade version of Galaga. Since then, I have looked in vain for a good home-computer version of the game 'cause it remains one of my favorites. There have been several attempts on the Amiga, but all to date have fallen short for one reason or another. My wait is finally over. Deluxe Galaga is the game I have been waiting for! Actually, if memory serves correctly, Deluxe Galaga is not really a clone - it's an IMPROVEMENT! The general game look and feel is there. The graphics are as good or better than the original, the attacking characters look and act the same, and there is the same ability to capture attacking creatures and use them as spare weapons. But there are added features as well. There is a game difficulty selection option...and an added meteor shower to negotiate...and a warp malfunction that from time to time leaves you facing some rather formidable foes.. and the ability to buy extra weapons between rounds if you have collected enough coins. All in all, it's one of the best games I have run across on the Amiga. Not bad for something you can pick up free out of the library. Actually, the game isn't free, it's shareware. To register, you need to send $10 to Edgar Vigdal in Norway. That's a bargain. I hope he sees lots of $10 fees coming his way. He deserves it. You'll find this one on MCCCA \_673.

## Tracker Music

No month would be complete without the obligatory addition of some more tracker music to our collection. This month is no exception, although the selection is much more limited than in most months. Chalk it up to the plethora of clipart. Still, you'll find selections on MCCC-A 674 and on MCCC--A \_675. I have just a single pick for the month. Check out Slow

## The Amiga Blues

you don't get no respect? author unknown o you say you own the 'Rodney Dangerfield of PC's' " And you say the Executives who are running the company are doing their best imatation of the Three Stooges. And they really do have names like Larry, Moe and Curly Joe. You think every great game ever invented runs on H.A.L.eh... I.B.M And the people and companies who were supporting YOUR PC have vaporized, dissapeared, dried up and blown away. And your wife still ain't come home from the movies yet.

Is that what's got you down boobie?

Well I'd say from where you're sitting you're probably right, but everything's relative, chum. From where I'm sittin' it don't look like that at all. Maybe a change of perspctive will help. Certainly one more Mac vs Amiga won't. What a dumb idea...let's take two really super PC's and bash them together continuously. For what good reason?

When I sit down in front of my Amiga I strap on my seatbelt 'cause I know I'm taking the fastest ride in the business. I've got an old A500 sitting in the cornner that's a more sophisticated computer than any PC sold today straight out of the box. "A yeah, right, but what has it done for me lately" you say. I say the only thing sophisti- cated about IBM and compatibles is the support. All the magazines, all the third party developement, all the compatible machines sitting on everyone's work desk, all the networking. Makes for a very sophisticated environment. But does it make for a sophisticated Machine? You figure it out.

If you live in Britian you can laugh in the face of any other PC owner. Why? Because in Britian, Amiga has the numbers to back up the gloating.

In Germany: too, Amiga owners walk down the street with pride. This is

## Thought For The Month

A quote attributed to one of America's founders, John Adams, in the play 1776: "I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace, two men are called a law firm, and three or more become a congress.

the same PC that people in America wringing thier hands over. Well, I've got some news for you -- right now today, in the cities and towns of America there are more Amigas being sold than ever before.

It's a fact — you can look it up.

Those kinds of things are important. They're important to know, because the life of your PC is important.

But I could say what comes tomorrow is Pie in the Sky. What about the PC sitting on your desk right now? There are not enough ideas in your head to tire out this machine. There are more than enough software packages sittimg on the shelves today to keep you entertained for the rest of your life. "Yeah, but what about the next big thing" you say. I say the next big thing's already here...it's called a "personal computer," and if yours is an Amiga then you're a very lucky guy (gal, droid, hamster).

If you want to argue with me, you're welcome to, but I won't argue with you. I haven't got time. I've got some star gazing to do, some landscapes to render, some music to blast, some animations to think up, some images to distort, some other universes to visit, and some... ‹insert. thing to do here›.

With Spring only a few days away, nature begins the process of renewal. With that same thought, maybe a process of renewal can begin for Commodore. Possibly CD32 is that spring!

Every meeting has one good question that seems to bring about a very long and educational round of talk and this meeting is no exception. Someone asked about the needs of the Amiga to run a CD-ROM on it. This brought about discussions on specs, types of drive, and other related thoughts. A question on the end of the Motorola 680x0 line was asked as well as the whereabouts of the 68060. Not sure if that has an answer. Talk of the change in Commodore's president was the subject of our next discussion. Who will it be next? Trust me, it took a lot longer than that paragraph makes it look!

Scott Lamb kicked off this month's meeting by telling us that we would have two presentations to see: CD32 and some software from the library. Also, thanks were sent to Gary Campbell who was taking over for a vacationing Ned. Getting things rolling on our usual "Question and Answer and Rumors and News" session came the news of an update to Final Writer. Some bug fixes and new features, but most important — an UNDO has been added! Scott Lamb read an open letter from Amigaman, one of the larger mailorder dealers that advertise in the major publications. His message was to shoot down all the doom and gloom news. Sounded good to all who were there. Fred Fish announces new collection roundup with the names Fresh Fish, Frozen Fish, and Gold Fish.

over it. It's a game machine, computer, movie machine, set top cable box and educator. CD32 features the internal parts of the 1200 coupled to a dual speed CDROM drive. All this just to give Commodore a foothold on the booming game market. First we were shown some games. Some new titles and a few old to demonstrate compatibilities with CDTV software. There was nothing to rave about, but the exciting stuff has yet to arrive. There are many titles already shown and even more promised. If anyone takes full advantage of this thing, some knockout games should be the result. Even more incredible was the movie. We watched part of Star Trek VI. This took advantage of the MPEG module installed in this particular unit. The movies are stored on a disc the size of a standard CD. It is compressed into a digital format that allows up to 74 minutes of a movie on each disc. I'm not sure of the success of the movies in this format, as they are just a little sharper than the VHS tape, but with better sound. LaserDiscs are better in picture quality and sound quality. The MPEG cartridge does open new avenues for game programming though. Philips CD-I player now offers games with movie-like scenes integrated into the game. CD32 should be even more capable, right? All of us can hope that Commodore succeeds with this, as it appears that Commodore has pinned the future of the company on this magic box.

Our first presentation was the all new CD32. This thing has the title "Jack of all Trades" written all

Next up was Harold Williams and his 2000. Harold decided to show off some of those pieces of software that are in the library that deserve everyone's time to take a look at. Once you use them, you'll wonder how you got along without them. They are really that good! First up was Tools Daemon. No, I didn't spell it wrong. This nice piece of software allows you to add more to the menus. Anything you use on a regular basis can be added to the

Finally, something I've neglected to mention this year, the return of door prizes. Our new President has made it a point to have door prizes every month. If you weren't there then you missed your chance. Come on out next month. It won't hurt!

menu bar of Workbench. You gotta try it! Next we were shown AssignX This thing allows assigns to be made on the fly. If you ever run something and a requester pops up asking for a disk, it can be a bit confusing. Using AssignX gives you a multiple choice window that allows you to quickly tell the system where to look for what it needs. It's really a great idea! Next up was QMouse. This thing does so many operations it's hard to imagine all of that packed into such a small program. Not every one needs everything it does but there are a few that are worth the effort. Blanking the pointer after so many seconds or when you touch a key are of prime importance. There are so many others that I can recommend getting a copy just to read the list. Then you will more than likely find something you've been looking for. Finally, we were shown KingCON. This thing replaces the CON: and RAW: devices with even more advanced ones with features that should have been there all along. Looking at a Shell improved by KingCON should be enough to convince anyone it's worth having. A drag bar on the right side has been added! You can go through everything you've typed easily with the mouse. Can't remember a command? This thing will help you out the best it can. There are menus dedicated to the Shell and icons can be dropped onto the Shell to do what ever is necessary with it. Commodore should take a closer look at this and use it! This thing is a Shell users dream! You should have seen this Ned!

Genny White

The prodigal secretary returns! ...and so did all the other officers, giving us a full slate of support personnel for the March meeting. Our "Pres" Danny came in snazzy bow tie and suspenders to add a little class (?) to the proceedings. There were about twenty folks present, mostly us regulars but a few very welcome new faces. Our excellent V.P. Steve recorded all the news items for me, as I was running late, but declined to write the whole chapter article again. Didn't he do a great job the last two months? I really enjoyed his articles, and I appreciate his help a lot! Here's the latest: The Very First Issue of a new magazine was brought and passed around: Amiga Game Zone. Inside were reviews of ten CD32 titles in a special CD32 section, info on all sorts of other games, upcoming attractions and conversion possibilities, etc. There was a flyer available about subscriptions, or you can call 1-80032AMIGA. Sounds like fun! Then we got a look at a new book: Garage Virtual Reality by Linda Jacobson. She's collected all kinds of tips and info on simple and relatively low-cost Virtual Reality setups for PCs, Macs, and Amigas. Ask Danny Barnett for more info. (He's also our expert on interfacing a Nintendo Power Glove to the Amiga - heckuva mouse! and reports it will work on an A500 or A2000, but not on the AGA or A3000 systems). On the local front, Tom Brooks' BBS "AI" now has a 1.8 gigabyte drive online for your BBSing pleasure, and he has added Mac and C64/128 upload/download message bases for them what have those. The numbers again: 272-9476 or 276-7697. Aurora Chancy had word about a C64 to be given to a needy cause. Know a needy cause that wants one? Those anxious for the PageStream 3 release should hold their breath until April... coming soon. In the rumour department, the Commodore Shareholder Movement held a meeting March 2nd, and it is hoped that Irving Gould will respond to the concerns expressed there. Tidbyte: a product called Amigalink uses floppy ports to network 20 Amigas up to 300 feet, at 450KB/second. Neat! Dealer news: Software Etcetera in Allen (Hwy 5 &amp; Bethany) was mentioned as an Amiga stuff source, and my Plano neighbor Dataphile is dropping the Amiga stuff and offering their entertainment soitware at 35% off. Sorry to see them go!

For our demo of the evening, Ben Clingerman (president of the Amiga-by-the-Loop Chapter) sent his CD32 to visit, complete with the MPEG module. Thus enabled, it can read standard music CDs, CD-plusgraphics disks, CDI format CDs (for Phillips' interactive CD machine), and CDTV disks. We got to view a short demo segment of a flight simulator, and saw the CDTV Lemmings game in play. Pinball Fantasies was a hit, and I'm told it plays better on the CD32 gamepad than the keyboard version for the A500, and has 256 colors enhancing the graphics. The MPEG format capability (that's Motion Picture Expert Group — a way to put movies on CD) was illustrated with a copy of Star Trek VI - which took care of the rest of the meeting time, as us trekkies sat glued to the monitor. I noticed an occasional annoying jerk in the video (no, I don't mean Kirk, I mean the picture quality!) but the sound sounded fine to me and the image was quite clear. Very interesting!

Danny had to interrupt Star Trek (arrrg!) for the door prize drawing... we had a few nifty and unusual items. Bob Chancy took home a package from Metropolitan containing a Leisure Suit Larry 5 Hint Book, a printer stand, a CD32 poster, and a neat little triangular 3- color "floptical" marking pen. Eddie Cor won another Metropolitan goody package, with a Jack Nicklaus Golf course disk, and another printer stand, poster, and marker. Steve Nichols got another marker and poster, and a copy of Obliterator by Psygnosis, donated by Don Sobieck. An anonymous donor provided a "Tech II Joystick" to add to a poster and marker won by Tom Johnson. Fun, Facts, and Freebies! See you in April...

## Metro C-64/128 Brenda Sessums

Yassou, Metro C-64/128 Users! Boy, did we have a great March meeting. Our membership continues to grow with 21 people filling the hall last month. John Burt kept everyone entertained with demos, while Phil Heberer got a lot of disk activity making copies of C64 Alive! for members. Brenda Sessums kept pretty busy using Baby (an SX-64) for copying PD from the library for members. And Jo Lynn got to make a lot of copies for one of our new members, too!

We had several new memberships, as well as a few renewals from our die-hards. And speaking of dieHard magazine, (were we?) Phil said this one is a must for subscription because it really supports the 128 and 64. Commodore Country has it if you don't already have a subscription (and why don't you?). A new magazine called Commodore World is going to be available for $29.95 per year, and that's 40% off the cover for this magazine. One advantage to having an MCCO membership is the C64 Alive! disk magazine which comes out every two months. It is free with your paid club membership. This month's magazine is already here, and it comes in three disks. This issue includes programs for the Plus 4, 128, and 64. You've got to have it!

## CHAPTER NEWS

Phil has catalogued the Metro 64 public domain library. We have 8000-9000 programs for the 64, and about 600 for 128.

comprehension. Boy, Evelyn Wood has nothing on him!

Including the MCCC BBS, there are four BBSes in our area that support the 64 and 128. System Control at (817) 268-1812, and Metroplex Mailbox at (817) 268-1422 are the best alternatives. Compunet at (817) 467-6125 is a new BBS that has started carrying files for 8bitters. Phil should know - he uploaded every one of the 8-bit files to it! Phil says, get on the Fidonet! This is available on Metroplex Mailbox and a few other local BBSes. You can be electronic pen pals with people from Australia, Germany and Canada, to name a few.

Phil showed disk labels the Fun Graphics Machine can do. Of course, it is a full-featured graphics program, not just a label maker, but the labels it can make are outstanding. Phil said club members get the FGM tutorial FREE! It's not even available to non-members. Of course, you still have to buy the FGM program disk from Commodore Country. By the way, CC also has several graphics disks to go with the FGM, the newest of which came in the week of the meeting!

Now for John Burt's demos! From Disk 814 came Function Machine for people who like numbers. It is a real brain teaser. You put a number in the top of the machine, and the animated machine crunches up the number and a new number slides out of the chute at the bottom. You get three guesses to what number should come out (based on the formula it decides on, but doesn't tell you!). We were all confused with the formula that came out "square the number and subtract 11!" On the same disk was Speed Reader. This one tells your reading speed and comprehension. One catchy phrase was "The Pig Missed the Barn." John Burt got this one with 347 words per minute at 100%

Disk 825 had Battleship. This is just like playing the board strategy game, but you play against the computer. It displays both your board and where you shoot salvos on your opponent's board. The Name Game was also on Disk 825. No, this isn't the rhyming "Banana Nana Fo Fama" name game. This one works like Hangman or Wheel of Fortune where it displays a certain number of blank spaces and you guess the word. In our example it was a phrase in which we had 15 seconds to guess each letter. The result was a winner with "Distant Pastures Appear Greener". The computer picks the word or phrase at random, so when you start the game again later, it probably won't be the same. Qix was just like the game on other popular gaming systems. Using a joystick, you try to fill in the screen area a block at a time and avoid the fire cracker fizzes and the gyroscoping lines - they will destroy you! At first, everything is slow and pretty easy, then it gets faster and harder to stay alive.

POOL2 was on Disk 830. The rules work like regular pool, except that you can select "T" to take a shot back (cheater!!!). Place a white dot on any marker along the side of the green and the cue ball will bank off that spot. John said you can't put any English on the ball, but it looks like a lot of fun.

Disk 839 had Question and Answers. By some of the questions, you could tell that this one was obviously written in Canada. It had historical, geographical and sports questions. We did 0% correct and the computer said "My comment is I'd say you know nothing." Well, excuuuse me! It was fun and enlightening, though. Mindbusters was sort of a single-sided Rubic's Cube puzzle match game. It's a lot of fun with various levels of difficulty. World Conquest was similar to Risk.

Your computer opponent gets to start the war (without even asking!). You pick the sectors where you want to deploy more troops or attack a neighboring territory.

The next demos John had were for the 128. Disk 716 sported Yahtzee for single player/computer or 2 to 7 competing players. Like the popular classic game, you "roll" five dice and try to get basically a poker hand. (Phil said there is a version of this available for the 64, too.) La Bella Lucie was like solitaire, but a little tougher, and had real catchy music. This one was played using the keyboard. You enter a command like "RAD" to tell the computer to "Remove Ace of Diamonds."

Disk 710 darted out of the gate with Clubhouse Turn by Darn Good Software (Nice name!) You start with $10,000 and pick your horse. Maybe you could test your luck here before you go out to Trinity Meadows? Thundering hooves hit the ground as you see horses moving across your screen. (Their legs don't actually move, but they slide across the screen.) John bet it all and lost it all. If we take him to Trinity, maybe he can just watch!

John put all these programs on one disk for the demo and had it available to copy at the meeting.

Rick Sealy found a new place that has goodies for our Commodore computers. Software Etc. in Allen (not to be confused with Software "What's a Commodore?" Etc. in Hurst!) has software and hardware on consignment, and Rick said that the prices are good. It is located at Bethany and Hwy. 5 (801 S. Greenville Ave.). If you don't want to make the drive (it's in the Plano area) call Rick to look for certain items for you. His number is (214) 736-3107.

In April, we'll try to have a demo of some British software for the C-64 that came with the magazines Commodore Country has started carrying. Of course, that won't be all, and we'll have a great time.
