## AmiCDROM v1.4

## a Usenet Review by Dylan McNamee

his is the first freely distributable CD-RON standard, the Rockridge extensions, and Macintosh HFS. It includes source in C. It works.

The program is available on the Aminet ftp sites in the file/pub/aminet/disk/cdrom/AmiCDROM-1.4.Iha. /It can be found on the MCCC BBS and in the MCCC library as well. ...ed/

## LIST PRICE

Free.

## SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

- Any Amiga with a SCSI host adapter supporting "SCSI Direct."

## HARDWARE

- A SCSI CD-ROM drive.

## SOFTWARE

Apparently works with AmigaDOS versions 1.3 through 2.1. (I tested it only on version 2.1.)

None.

## COPY PROTECTION

## MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

- Amiga 2500/30
- Commodore 2091 SCSI controller
- Apple CD300 CD-ROM drive (see a previous comp.sys.amiga.reviews review of this excellent drive)
- Kickstart 2.04, Workbench 2.1

## INSTALLATION

For AmigaDOS versions previous to 2.1, installation consists of slightly modifying a supplied Mountlist template, adding it to your DEVS:Mountlist file, and then copying the cdrom-handler file to your L: directory.

For DOS version 2.1 and above, installation consists of dragging the "CDO" icon into the DEVS:DosDrivers drawer, changing the icon's "info" to specify your CDROM's unit number, and copying cdrom-handler to Li. It would be nice to have an Installer script, for newer Amiga users; but even as is, installation is quite easy.

## REVIEW

Once installed, AmiCDROM makes a CD-ROM drive accessible by an Amiga. Operation is transparent and fast. Once you mount the CD device (e.g., "mount CDO:"), discs inserted into the CD-ROM drive show up on the Amiga Workbench, accessible just like an ordinary read only device. It works as advertised. I was able to read the following discs with AmiCDROM:

- Aminet CD-ROM (from Walnut Creek CD-ROM)
- Kodak's PhotoCD sampler (came with Apple CD300)
- Lost Treasures of Infocom 2 CD-ROM
- Lemmings CDTV
- Hypermedia's Fish Collection

- Various Mac HFS CD-ROMS
- Various MS-DOS &amp; Windows CD-ROMS (junk I had lying around)

## DOCUMENTATION

The archive comes with a "README" and a "doc" file. The doc file is slightly technical but very readable. A simple Amiga Guide help file would have been useful, but this is an excellent first effort.

## LIKES AND DISLIKES

I am amazed by this program. It has always seemed strange that all the CD-ROM filesystems for the Amiga were commercial, but the situation has persisted for years, effectively adding $40 to $90 (US) to any CD-ROM purchase. This program eliminates that extra cost for most CD-ROM users. Even more amazing is that it comes with source code, virtually ensuring a continuing stream of improvements and support.

Frank mentions in the documentation that Amiga protection bits are currently not supported, but will be added in a future version.

In addition, thę program does not support discs with the following features, simply because the author doesn't have access to discs with these attributes:

- Interleaved mode (ISO)
- Multi-disk volumes (ISO)
- Multi-volume disks (ISO)
- Logical blocks other than 2048 bytes (ISO)
- Deep directory relocation (Rock Ridge)

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

The only other CD-ROM filesystem I have used is CDROM-FS, from Canadian Prototype Replicas. CDROMFS supports one less filesystem (no HFS support) and the same set of CD-ROM drives. It has a bug which caused me to try AmiCDROM in the first place — using "Iha" to extract large archives directly from CD-ROM always hangs my Amiga. I haven't reported this bug to CPR, because l haven't been able to contact them. (1 wrote a letter over a year ago, trying to get an updated version of the software, and never received a reply. My current version of CDROM FS was updated by my dealer, after much hassle.)

Aside from CPR's CDROM-FS bug, the products are quite similar, except for the following cosmetic differences:

- CDROM-FS displays non-Amiga discs on Workbench with a fancy icon. AmiCDROM displays them with a generic disk icon.
- CDROM-FS comes with an Installer script and Amiga Guide documentation, and AmiCDROM does not.
- CDROM-FS comes with a program to control the playing of audio CD's. This program is much like Jukebox (available on the Aminet ftp sites) which I have found to be an excellent substitute. A bug in previous versiers of AmiCDROM prevented audio CD programs from working, but it has been fixed.

A previous version of AmiCDROM has been compared to other CD-ROM filesystems, and was found to be slower, due to lack of caching. The current version has added caching, but I haven't heard of any more recent benchmarks.

## BUGS

I found no bugs. (One net reader reports some Enforcer hits, but hasn't been able to attribute them to AmiCDROM for sure.)

## VENDOR SUPPORT

You get source code, and Frank's on the internet. Support just doesn't come better than that. In the past couple months, AmiCDROM has had three updates.

## CONCLUSIONS

I'm amazed by this program. Out of nowhere, this program reduces the cost of almost every Amiga CD-ROM drive by $40. Frank should be thanked and commended for his efforts (I guess that's what I'm doing here...).

## Thanks Frank!

I give it a hearty two thumbs up. On a scale of 1 to 5 shiny discs, I give AmiCDROM a solid 4.9. If it came with an Installer script and an AmigaGuide help file, this would raise my rating to 5.

## Modem Bargain

14.4K at an afordable price by Phil Heberer

A couple of days ago, I got an 800 number for an inexpensive 14.4k modem, and sent out the number on FidoNet. Well, I couldn't resist the price, and since I'm a glutton for punishment anyway with off-brand modems - 1 bought one.

MACWarehouse was very efficient getting the modem delivered as promised. I ordered it at 3 PM Monday, and received the package overnight at 10 AM the next day. The modem says Technology Concepts, Inc LineLink 144e on the front panel, but there is a sticker on the bottom that says it is made by Prometheus. The front panel also has the obligatory LEDs, marked AA CD OH 10 MR. It comes packed with a 9V AC 1 amp power supply, a cable for the MAC to connect the modem, a telephone line for connecting to the phone jack, and a 3.5" disk with MAC communications software.

The manual is fairly sparse, and directed at the Macintosh (obviously). Most of the AT commands are covered, but NONE of the "S" registers are even mentioned in the manual, other than that the modem accepts reading and writing the registers. Since the Hayes Technical Reference Manual is available for download on the Hayes Public BBS, that's not a problem (Hayes Support BBS, (404) 446-636. Go to File Area 3, sub-section 6 and download TRM288.TXT.) [Editor's Note: You can try the file called of Supra AT Commands on our BBS for a simpler alternative. It contains all the standard AT commands including the S-register settings.) After several hours of trying to get the modem initially configured, I

came up with the configuration you see in the accompanying block. It works.

Stored Profile 0 is how I presently have it working, and Stored Profile 1 is turns off error-correction and turns on XON/XOFF flow control. I'm open to suggestions from any of you comm gurus on optimizing this setup.

Using Desterm 2.0 on a C128D with SwiftLink, downloading to the 1750 REU with Xmodem IK, I've managed to achieve 1262 CPS on a QWK mail packet from a Maximus board. This is a fairly substantial improvement over the typical 840-860 CPS I generally got with my 9600 V32 modem. Since I have several people who have said they would give me the $60 I paid for the 9600 modem, the extra $42 is worth the extra speed. BTW, an ATI4 shows "SERIAL * V32BIS * V42BIS * VOICE 2.2 * TIES * CID * SRFAX *" . The modem advertises software add-ons for Fax and VoiceMail capabilities with the Macintosh. The modem is also rated at 14.4 for Fax Class II operation. All in all, I think this was an excellent value for the $102 bottom line figure delivered to your door. The modem is available from MACWarehouse in Lakewood, NJ, at 1-800-255-6227, model #0145.

I rather like running with the big dogs at a very reasonable price ‹grin». In the same catalog, 2400 baud modems were selling for the same price (or MORE!), just different manufacturers. For me personally, I'm intersted more in performance than in brand name. l

## How Do I Multi-Task?

let me count the ways author unknown ow do I Multi-task? Let me count the ways. . Windows way.

The Macintosh uses a system called a "needs time"

system. This means that each Mac program contains a module which tells the operating system that it is not doing anything at the moment and the Mac can then try to run another program. There is no hierarchy or assigned priority of

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000002_dcaf352905277318de7859ab6d0293082c9a5be7d58cbc0ceaf2d18343295450.png)

various programs: each has the same priority. That is also the reason why some programs actually crash the multi-tasking capability of the Mac - the module which tells the operating system that it can run another program in its "blank time" spots is not present in that program.

There are various reasons why some programmer leave that module out. Some programmers (usually PD or shareware) are simply unaware of that module and accidentally leave it out of the program. Then again, perhaps a programmer wants a smaller program and intentionally leaves it out. And of course, games usually take over the whole system and certainly don't want to share time with any-

thing else. Of course, all these reasons really take only the programmer's convenience into mind and leave the consumer (you) out of the picture totally. Not very nice on their part.

The Amiga uses the "preemptive" system for multi-tasking. Each program has a priority level assigned to it which allows it so much time from the operating system's attention at any one time. When the operating system's internal time table of program priorities tells it that program's time is up, the next priority program is run for its allotted time. This is done on an interrupt level. It puts the responsibility for run-time decisions on the operating system rather than trusting to the programmer to remember to add in the all-important module to selflessly give up its time to other programs.

Some unscrupulous programmers can still get around the system by assigning their program an unnaturally high priority. (In fact, there is the story of the short-lived program that assigned itself a higher priority than the operating system itself and locked up every time it was invoked!)

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000003_1deba0d1a821924dc438d567779fdc61f284ebb64986a4282743073ed9ef7eed.png)

Both systems can be quite effective when the

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000004_687ad51089311d66de71b3f5d82ab5bf04b68666ce257bbffcac555db8631131.png)

programmers stick to the rules, although the Amiga system does have the advantage of generally smaller land more efficient...ed.) program code, since it does not have to include the extra module in each program.

And where does the Windows system of multitasking fit in? Multi-tasking for Windows takes a bit more personal effort. First, click the mouse on the first application, count to 5, click on the second application, count to 5, and repeat \_ again and again!

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

G et ready, library fans. This month there are · TWENTY-THREE new disks available for your listening, viewing, gaming and general computing pleasure. These are, of course, in addition to any new disks which Mr. Fish may send in our direction. LOTS of good stuff.

## Personal Paint by Cloanto Italia sas

Personal Paint is a commercial package. And, yes, it is in our library — but only until May 31, 1994. This is a kind of a gift/teaser to the Amiga community. Until the end of May we are allowed to use this program (not the latest version) and convince ourselves that we simply can't live without it. I'm not going to go into a long review of the program. Like any paint program it is FULL of features and a complete review would take pages. What I can say is that it is definitely worth looking at. In addition to the normal paint options, Personal Paint includes some image processing capabilities - kind of a mini-ADPro. You'll find it on its own disk -- which will allow us to remove it from the library at the end of May easily. Get it before it's too late. And then purchase the latest version.

## MineRunner by Matthias Bock

Yes, I know...I've written about MineRunner already. It hit the library and my hard drive a couple of months ago. But now there is an upgrade. In this version the iris start to each level and the flipping "Game Over" animation have been added. Now it's closer than ever to the original C-64 classic. If you're hooked, be sure to get this upgrade. It's on MCCC-A \_ 636.

## Tracker Music

With twenty-three disks you can be sure there's lots of music. In all, there are twentyeight tunes on ten different disks. My favorites? I thought you'd never ask!

Blue o n Darkside Interceptia, and Time's on

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000005_f9f99946f2abc4fe34131d7c196dc6c6aa57059627b14622ebb54ffc93e5c05b.png)

Gentle Winds, NoName and Planetgroove on MCCC A \_651. Those of you who are collectors may notice a familiar name in the group - Crystal Rain. Yes, we have had that tune before...and it has always been one of my favorites. But this version has been re-scored. There are some minor differences in the arrangement but the big difference that some of the instruments have been replaced. This version is MUCH better, and that's saying a lot because it was always outstanding.

## Pictures

Of course if we're talking about music, we ought to talk about pictures as well. There aren't as many to choose from this month as in the music category, but there

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000006_5d61b2b0ad7e7dfcc6f889e02213fb424c6f4c27b92fd157c91da9eedc072f79.png)

There's Pastel MCCC-A\_ 637; O.the Moon, Stormbringer the Remedy on A 638; It's So MCCC-A\_639; 647; A\_ 648; Arkham Rain on MCCCand Enter Our Worid

Cool Hideaway Blues on BlowUp on MCCCAsylum and Crystal A \_649; Clairvoyance on MCCC-A\_ \_650;

are some that are definitely worth adding to your collection. On MCCC-A\_649 is a GIF picture of a space shuttle lift-off. Very dramatic. And on MCCC-A\_635 is a JPEG picture of a fast-running mountain stream.

## Virus Checker by John Veldthuis

This is the latest Virus Checker - version 6.34. If you're not checking for viruses you need to start. If you are, you're probably using Virus Checker already. In either case, be sure to get this version. Virus Checker looks for boot block viruses automatically when you insert a floppy. It will also look for link viruses on any disk you specify and it will scan your computer's memory for viruses. The latest is on MCCC-A 639.

## ParM, QMouse, SuperDuper and Tools Daemon

Speaking of upgrades, here are a few more. All are very worthwhile utilities that you should probably take a look at if you're not already using them. ParM, by Sylvain Rougier and Pierre Carrette, stands for Parametrable Menu. It allows you to add menus to your Workbench to do anything you like. Actually, there are other utilities that do the same thing better...Tools Daemon for instance. But ParM has a feature that is somewhat unique. It has the capability of opening a small titlebar window instead of attaching itself to Workbench. That means that it can run on ANY public screen that is currently the default for your system. You can now supply custom menus for any public screen. This is version 4.5 and it's on MCCCA -643.

simultaneously, copying from a disk image in RAM, in RAD: or on a hard drive (FFO:). And it's FAST. This release, 3.1, is on MCCC-A\_648.

Tools Daemon, by Nico Francois, is another utility to add menus to your Workbench. This one, unlike ParM, will only attach to the Workbench — but in all other respects it is a much better program. It allows you to add as many menus to your Workbench as space permits...and each of those menus can have as many items as you like.

Sub-menus are supported as well. And the whole program is controlled via an easy to understand Intuition interface. Programs that are started can be started as if from the Workbench (the icon is read for stack size, tool types, etc.) or as if from a shell (parameters can be passed). On my system I run Tool Manager and Tools Daemon on my Workbench, and ParM on custom public screens. Version 2.1a of Tools Daemon, the latest, can be found this month on MCCC-A\_648.

## Yass by Albert Schweizer

Yass stands for "Yet Another Screen Selector." To install it, simply put it in your WBStartup drawer. To activate it, press the shift and esc keys (the keys used are configurable, but these are the default). A small window will be activated on the current screen that will show the screens currently running in your system. Select the one you want and you are taken there at once. No more switching from screen to screen. It works on windows too if you like. There are other screen selectors out there but I have found this one to be both more reliable than the others (it opens on ANY screen in the system) and smaller. Check it out. It really comes in handy if you have a lot of screens going at once in your system. It's on MСCC-A\_641.

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000007_16c863bb35f4628298975223408c66a8b845caa10c30c7f94c073eda44d3a909.png)

QMouse, by Dan Babcock, is one of those gotta-haveit utilities that no system should be without. It supplies mouse blanking, screen blanking, mouse acceleration, pop cli, click to front, click to back, and a bunch of other stuff. Any of its options can be enabled or disabled depending on your desires. But Mouse's most impressive feature is the ability to make whatever screen is foremost the default system screen. This is the way the Amiga should run right out of the box. Stuff opens up where you are. Be sure to get this upgrade. It's version 2.90 and it's on MCCC-A\_643.

SuperDuper, by Sebastiano Vigna, is a powerful floppy disk copier. It supports copying to multiple drives

## Clipart

We haven't added any clipart to our collection in quite a while. Well, it's time to change that. This month there are three disks full of clipart that are well worth adding to your collection. MCCC-A\_654, MCCC-A\_ 655 and MCCC-A\_656 are chock full of black and white IfF clipart. All are animal pics. They range in style from lifelike drawings to cartoon figures. Be sure to check 'em out.

Just wanted to tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Jon Brecka. I started Computer Mart to offer the local users a choice when buying peripherals for their computers. I cover most products for Amigas, Macs, and PCs. Computer Mart is home owned and operated. This helps to keep the prices down. I am not trying to compete with the larger retail stores, but instead offer a lower cost option for the user that does not need all the support of a large store. I will however help you in any way I can with all your computer needs. Please call for pricing. If you get an answering machine, please leave a message and l will call you back as soon as possible.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop Pete Good

Where does the time go?

Almost March and Taxes are just around the corner. The February meeting of the Loop chapter was to have been a first viewing of Commodore's CD32 machine. Unfortunately things did not go quite as well as Ben (our President) had hoped. Suffice to say that the machine was stuck in a warehouse someplace other than the North Richland Hills Community Center! Ben brought the meeting to order and started the gathering with a forceful speech regarding the spreading of the AMIGA word. The main aim was to get people to write articles for our beloved Newsletter. He then mentioned the "Extremely questionable" 'NEW" machines that are supposedly being put together by an outside vendor (see last months newsletter). Personally I think this type of publicity hurts the Amiga rather than helps it. The question and answer session revolved around these dubious fixtures, along with other more realistic questions. The swap table that Ben proposed last month was in evidence at this meeting with several pieces of software available.

The presentation was a demo of DCTV given by Ben. This was an interesting demo for those who had not seen DCTV previously, with Ben showing several of the many ways that pictures can be manipulated with the software and hardware.

Many thanks to Ben for the presentation.

I have it on good authority that the March meeting of the loop will feature the CD32 platform, so I suggest you leave the second Tuesday free and come visit with us.

Well, that's it for this month. We hope to see you at our next meeting of the Amiga By-The-Loop in March.

## Amiga Central

Johnny Kitchens

This month's meeting started with a question. When should we start the meeting? Our usual time to try and start is 7:30pm. It usually starts later by the time things settle down. The question is, should it be sooner, earlier, or stay where it is. I've never had a problem with it myself, but if you want to help adjust it for the better, speak up at the next meeting. A new magazine for the Amiga was shown. It is Amiga Game Zone, the first American all game magazine for the Amiga. It lacks the flash of the European issues, but at least it's something. Some interesting news on the HewlettPackard and Commodore deal were discussed. This deal could generate some serious cash flow for CBM. Someone asked what the AAA chipset was. Let's just say it's the future of the Amiga, hopefully more. Where's the 68060? Does anyone know? Some talk on how well off Commodore is. They appear to be in pretty good shape compared to some time back. Let's hope it keeps going in the right direction. Commodore's decision to hold a secret stock holder's meeting appears to have cut the stockholder's movement to get rid of you-know-who short. Apparently NewTek has lost a few of its top

![Image](1994_03_artifacts/image_000011_238aba47deab32a347fe85c2e1be95782bf5994695cc418ca13fefdd3ea4ba58.png)

people. That's a little sad. A lower priced 4000 appears to be in the works — let's hope it gets here faster than the 4000T. Someone asked what a Zorro slot is. It's the path to expansion was one answer. Is the CD32 out in the U.S. yet? Apparently it is in a way, or sort of. A very long discussion on the problems of installing 2.1 with a Trifecta hard drive controller. Hopefully we cleared it up. We had a new attendee to our meeting. He was from South America. He uses the Amiga to digitize and analyze South American Indian music. There's a use for the Amiga! He was asking for old software to take back with him, since it's a bit tough to find in that area.

For our main presentation we had the honor of getting D. Simmons to demo the DAT tape backup system and PAR Board. I have to say this was one incredible demo. D.'s Amiga 2000 was bristling with horsepower and accessories. 34 megs of memory, 68040, Toaster, and enough goodies to keep us all excited. The DAT tape backup looks like sure-fire winner for huge storage problems. With 2 gigabytes of storage on each tape, you can store quite a lot of backups for some time to come. He showed AmiBach that he uses for backup purposes, and Tape Worm which allows the DAT drive to be used as another drive. Though slow compared to a hard drive, the amount of storage certainly gives it a plus. D. pointed out that the tapes could be bought for $9.00 apiece. The drives were in the $1300 to $1400 range, though refurbished drives can be had for less. If a huge amount of storage is something you need, then the DAT drive could be what you are looking for.

be had, and it can record to the hard drive in real time, live animations at a rate of 60 fields a second! This thing is fast and incredible! If you missed this you missed the Amiga in a moment of pure shining glory. D. showed animations that would make any Amiga owner proud. The sharks were awesome. He showed a video he made that was funny and entertaining. All of these were video perfect. Next he used a video camera to film everyone in the audience, in both regular time and time lapse photography. It certainly showed there is more than one way to shoot a video and certainly shows that DeskTop Video is here, is usable, is powerful, and the Amiga has it! Finally I'd like to send my thanks to D. Simmons for taking the time to do this presentation, plus packing up all that expensive equipment and bringing it to the meeting. I'm sure he felt better once he got it back to his home.

## Amiga North Dallas Steve Nichols

Hello Amiga fans! Welcome to another recant of the ever popular Amiga North Dallas meetings. This account captures the excitement and spontaneity of our January gathering and once again highlights our AWOL secretary. She just can't seem to adjust her life to our meetings.

The meeting was called to order at 7:39 P. M. by our everpopular-president-type-person, Danny Bartlett. He opened with a hearty welcome to any newcomers, and once again explained our new non interrogation format. Comments were then entertained from the floor: Babylon 5 was dis'ed for the visible spotlight beam in space vacuum, but otherwise lauded for its great FX; and Sunrize will give a demo of it's AD16 at

Metropolitan's Amiga Day on March 12. Next up was Rumours, which suffered a quick death from dirth.

A general discussion was started by Danny, as he noted he had problems using AmigaGuide in Directory Opus; Ned Kelly wondered if anyone knew of an easy to use utility for playing sounds from the Workbench; Egon Pasztor described his problems with his C Compiler; and I floated a description of my problems with a sporadic HD accessing problem after cold or warm boots.

Finally, it was time for the Main Event, the Big Kahuna; and Danny introduced the 1993 winner of the METCOM art contest: MICHAEL, JAMES TILTON. Using just an A2000, a 1084S, a NEC monitor, DCTV, Image FX, GigaMem, and PageStream; he loaded up a 1980 x 1320 image that he had composed just for our meeting, and incidentally for use as a business card. Anyway, Michael had opted out of the construction trade after 20 years, and now hawks clip art (obviously this was not an intended pun, as he does maintain a booth at the yearly Scarborough Faire) and original printed graphics. Folks, ya' gotta' see it to believe it. Turning an old cow (the A2000) into a racehorse is not a miracle, it's a reality. 24-bit graphics cards need not apply. If you haven't been exposed to GVP's ImageFX, get an inoculation before you do or you'll end up buying a copy just like I did. It helped that I already had DCTV, so the latest addition to my system exacted little retribution on my bank stash. Hey you other chapters, if Mike hasn't graced your meeting with a presentation, your loss. Michael finished his fine presentation at 9:00, and then fielded questions for the next half-hour until we packed him off for home.

This Month: Let's hope and pray I nail a presentation.

April: Ned Kelly &amp; PhonePak

May: Bill Raecke &amp; NickPrefs &amp; other assorted (a sordid?) WB programs

June: Getting ahead of myself here, aren't I?
