## METCOM 94

everything a computer hobbyist or professional could want by David Owens

W ell, the fate of Commodore may be in question right now, but the plans for METCOM 94 are definitely underway. For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, let me explain. METCOM is MCC's once a year, super blow-out show that has everything a computer hobbyist or professional could want. It's exciting, educational, and a great place to pick up bargains and best of all, it doesn't cost one red cent. That's right, it is FREE. METCOM will be held at the Arlington Convention Center again this year. I wasn't around when this club had its first METCOM, but Ill never miss another one.

METCOM will not change much this year from what it was last year. Our local dealers will be there with great deals on software and hardware for our machines. I have already contacted Metropolitan and Commodore Country and they both plan to attend. While I'm on the subject of dealers, I would like to take this minute to thank all of them for the support they have given this club over the years. Without them, many of the things we do would not be poseible — like putting on METCOM. When you go by their booths, give them a hearty thank you as you leave your money in their pockets;-).

Will there be classes again this year? But of course, I answer in my worst French accent. Harold Williams is the educational director again this year and will be coming up with subjects for the classes at METCOM. The new version of PageStream should be shipping as you hold this newsletter in your hot little hands. PageStream has always been the most popular class we have offered and I'm sure it will be one of the classes that day. If you have any other subjects that you would like to have covered, please give Harold a call and let him know what you would like to see. His number is on the inside back page of this newsletter.

And what of the flea market? It keeps getting bigger and better every year. This year should be no exception. We will begin collecting items for the flea market at the

September meetings. There will be a rep. at each chapter meeting with brand new forms. Read the forms carefully before you sign because there have been several changes. The flea market has, in my humble opinion, been one of the best reasons to attend METCOM. You never know what kind of hardware/software gems you will come across digging through all the items that are there. I always come away with my wallet empty because of those special items that you couldn't afford or just can't find any more. So come on out and see what special deals await you.

Just a few other things to mention. Do door prizes make your palms sweat and your heart race? Well, they do mine. This is another reason to support our dealers and They generously donate door prizes to METCOM year after year after year after... well, you get my drift. In the past we have had great games, donations by Metropolitan, Commodore Country, INOVAtronics, Soft-Logik Publishing, New Horizons and many others. I don't have a list of the door prizes this year, but we hope to continue this great tradition. We will also have our 13 for 12 offer. A 13 month club membership for the normal annual dues. You can't get a better deal that (because we can't offer it ;-)). There will be a club area at METCOM so you can extend your membership, encourage a friend with an Amiga or C-64/C-128 to join and help us continue doing the things we do each year for our members. The club libraries will be available for you to pick up any disk out of the thousand's of PD and Fred Fish disks we have for a

Well, I have just about run out of steam for this article. Plan to attend METCOM this year and... What's that you say? When is METCOM? Just about forgot. METCOM will be held on November 5, 1994 from 10:00 am 'til 5:00 pm. Make your plans to attend and bring a friend with you when you come. More in next month's newsletter. Hope to see you all.
