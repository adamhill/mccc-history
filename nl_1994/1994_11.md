## METCOM '94

here it comes... by David Owens

, y the time you read this article, METCOM should show each year and having a fantastic day of shopping, learning and maybe winning. Once again we have a full day of activities planned that you can participate in and enjoy.

price is after 4:00. So come one, come all to those rare treasures found only at the METCOM flea market. And bring plenty of cash.

Harold Williams, our educational coordinator, has put together a wide range of classes to satisfy the curiosity of the machines we love. He has put together three classes for us to enjoy. The hard drive basics class starts at 10:30 a.m. and will inform about backups, recoveries, installing, partitioning and other topics. If you have never delved into understanding your hard drive, this is the class for you. There will also be a PageStream 3.0 class and a CanDo 3.0 class from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Harold has told me some of the new features in CanDo and it sounds like INOVAtronics has really overdone it this time. If you're a CanDo fanatic like I am, you won't want to miss this class. And then there is the new version of PageStream. I've got my copy already and am working through the manual, but if you have questions, just come to the class. There will be plenty of experience there to answer all of your questions. If you are interested in any of these classes and haven't signed up yet, you can sign up at METCOM. There is a small fee to help defray the cost of some of the supplies. Many of the classes will also have a disk to give out with helpful programs or examples of what you see in the class.

The flea market is what I always enjoy digging into to find those precious gems of software that I have always wanted to try, but never had the cash to buy. Hardware, software and everything in-between. It is always one of the great draws of the show. Of course, if that item you have kept your eye on all day hasn't sold by 4:00 p.m. it may go down in price. We have our 4:00, last chance to get rid of that thing you don't want to have to find some place to put for another year sale. If the seller just doesn't want to take it back home, you can find out what that

Our local dealers will also be in attendance with great deals on the items they have to sale. I would like to personally thank all of our dealers who have helped make METCOM the success it has always been. Without their support, METCOM would not have always come off the way it has. They have been wonderful and have helped with more than just METCOM. They have given us special deals for our BBS, and donated door prizes for our chapter meetings and for METCOM. A special thanks for all of our dealers. Oh, by the way, I have a firm commitment from Commodore Country and Metropolitan has indicated they will also be there.

And last, but not least, are the door prizes. If we get half of the things we have been promised, we should have some great things to give away. There will be three times for drawings, at 12:00, 2:00 and 4:30. Some of the contributors include INOVAtronics, Soft-Logik, SoftWood, DKB, OXXI, and Paravision as of this time. Come by and see what all we have to give away as door prizes.

One more thing before I wrap this up. I was concerned about the parking at the Arlington Convention Center. There should be plenty of mud where all of the new parking will be (but won't be) by the time of the show. Well, I asked about the parking situation and I was told that there would be shuttles running from the parking lots around the BallPark stadium. It will be best to drive around to the front of the Convention Center and look for directions for parking. Then you can either take a short hike to the Convention Center or wait for the shuttle.

I'm out of steam (aren't you glad ;)) I hope to see you at METCOM - and bring a friend to see what is still the best home computer on the market today. See you soon.

fun. P.S. If you get this after METCOM, hope you had

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

1 acheront by Adam Dawes For anyone who has a rather large font directory in their system, here is a little utility you've been waiting for. If you have a number of fonts, you've probably noticed that the system takes some time to bring up a list of fonts. This is true the first time you access a font requester even if you are using a file requester that buffers the font list. Well, CacheFont eliminates that wait time. It does its magic by building a list of fonts in your font drawer. You simply run a little program called MakeFontList (part of the distribution) to build the list. Then you add Cachefont to your userstartup script. After that, your font list is close to instantaneous every time a font requester is brought up by any application. The only small catch is that you have to run MakeFontList manually every time you modify your font directory. It's a small price to pay. Cachefont works great. It's on MCCC-A 766. Try it.. you'll like it!

## MagicExpansion by Johannes Beigel Magic User Interface (MUI) by Stefan Stuntz

For those'of you using Magic Workbench and/or Magic User Interface (MUI), here's something you'll want to get. It's nothing more than a collection of pointers, icons, palettes, and window patterns — but we can't have too many of those can we? These are very well done and worth checking out. The collection is on MCCC-A 760. -Speaking of MUI, the latest version (2.2) can be found on MCCCA \_764.

## term 4.1 by Olaf Barthel

In last month's newsletter I wrote about term version 4.0. I said at that time that I considered term to be the most powerful terminal package available for the Amiga, but that I had mixed feelings about version 4.0 because of some display problems. As a matter of fact, I stayed with the older version myself due to those display problems and a few other problems I had when using nonstandard settings. My reservations have been washed away. Version 4.1 retains all the new features of 4.0 including the script learn feature and the improved phone book...and it fixes the display problems and all the other problems I had with 4.0. Now I can recommend it unconditionally. And yes, I have made the switch myself. term is still big. Because of its size, it is distributed in archived format on disks MCCC-A\_761 through 763.

## MultiFileSystem by Nicola Salmoria

Last month's newsletter featured an article by Johnny Kitchens in which he wrote about alternate disk formats and a program called MultiFileSystem to tie everything together and make those alternate formats easier to use. You may have been wondering where you could get the program. Well, wonder no more! MultiFileSystem can be found on MCCC-A \_763. That's all -I have to say about this one. Johnny covered it just fine last month.

## ShowObj by Andreas Heumann

Have you been wishing you had a way to view an Imagine object as easily as you can view a picture? Now you do! ShowObj can

be used just like a picture viewing utility. Just type the

command followed by the name of the Imagine

object you'd like to view and there it is. You

can zoom in or out on your object and

you can view it from any side.

It's fast, it's easy, and you don't

even need to own

Imagine to use it. I took a few

minutes and

taught Directory

## Emplant Deluxe

better and faster than a mac usenet review by Gene Ruebsamen he Emplant is a Zorro-Il board that allows emulation of various different computers via your Amiga. Currently, the only emulation that is written for the Emplant is the Macintosh, which emulates a full-colour Macintosh on your Amiga. The type of Mac emulated by the Emplant is dependent upon your CPU speed.

## COMPANY INFORMATION

Utilities Unlimited International

790 Lake Havasu Ave Suite #16

Lake Havasu City, AZ 86403 USA Telephone: (602) 680-9004 FAX: (602) 453-6407

## LIST PRICE

Unknown. I paid $399 (US) for the Deluxe board.

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

68020 CPU or greater Mac 256K ROMS (v1.1 v1.3) Minimum of 2 megs of FAST memory. Hard drive required.

## SOFTWARE

AmigaOS 2.04 or higher. A Macintosh System (boot) disk.

## COPY PROTECTION

None.

## MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

Amiga 3000/25, 8 MB Fast RAM, 2 MB Chip RAM. 1 internal 880k floppy drive. Maxtor 213 MB SCSI Hard Drive. Quantum 105 MB SCSI Hard Drive. AmigaDOS 2.1

KingCon 1.4 replacing the Amiga Shell.

## INSTALLATION

The Macintosh emulation software installs from an 880K floppy disk. Version 4.5 was the latest 'full' version on disk, therefore I had to install v4.5 then install the v4.6 patches on top of it. It was quite easy as both versions used the standard Commodore Installer.

## REVIEW

I will be reviewing only the Macintosh emulation software in this review. The IBM 486DX emulation is supposed to be near completion, but there has been no release date set, and no one I know has it as of yet.

The Emplant comes on a Zorro-II board that is easily placed inside any Zorro-II equipped Amiga (A2000/3000/4000). There are four different versions of the board: a basic one with no ports, one with two Mac serial ports, one with a SCSI port, and one with both serial ports and the SCSI port (this one is called the deluxe model). I have the deluxe model, so I will be be reviewing it.

The first thing you notice when you plug in the board is that there are two Macintosh serial ports, and one SCSI port on the backplate of the board (the side sticking out the back of your Amiga). These serial ports are capable (according to the manual... I have never tested them at any faster than 14.4k) of transfer speeds up to 230.4k baud normally, yet with the special Emplant hardware, the speed can be quadrupled (between two Emplant boards ONLY) to 921.6k baud for AppleTalk (the standard Macintosh networking) or 460.8k if connected to a DoubleTalk board. The serial ports are not the standard Amiga RS-232 style, they are the Mini-DIN type. The second thing you will notice is the large SCSI port. The SCSI interface uses the 53C80 SCSI chip. It is NOT SCSI-II. It is a standard SCSI-I controller.

Before you can use your hardware, you must have the 256k ROM from an Apple Macintosh computer, OR you can copy the ROMS off of a Macintosh that uses the 256k type. (Note: You MUST own the Macintosh that you copy the ROMS from, otherwise you could be in violation of copyright law.) A program included with the Emplant distribution software, called ROMINFO, will dump the ROMs when run on a Macintosh. In order to get this program to a Mac, you have to copy it to an IBM formatted disk via CrossDOS and then load it into a Mac that is able to read IBM disks, or you could use a modem. The ROMINFO program will dump the MAC ROMs to the same Diskette, and you can now use that ROM Image with your Emplant. If you opt for the first method (using the actual ROMs with the board) you must use a program called ROMDUMP to dump the ROMS onto your hard drive, then you must remove the actual ROMS from the board. From now on, your Emplant will use the ROM Image that is on your hard drive. Either way, you will end up with the same image.

Once you have the ROM image, you can start the Emplant and get things up and running. There are three versions of the software that come with the Emplant: a version for EC processors (680EC20, etc.), a version for Amigas with the actual kickstart ROM chips (A2000/4000 and some 3000), and another version for Amiga 3000's with the softkicked kickstart ROMs. When you first start the emulation software, you will be presented with a preferences screen, where a plethora of options are presented to you. You are able to select the amount of

memory that the emulation will use, the screenmode, 24 or 32-bit emulation (more on this later), mouse and keyboard emulation, sound, etc....

When the emulation first starts, your computer will beep (a la Macintosh), and should you have a Mac hard disk hooked to the SCSI port or a boot disk in the drive, the Macintosh will proceed to boot. Once you are on the Mac side, everything runs well.. pretty much like a Macintosh. The only major difference will be the ejection of the disks. A little symbol will appear at the top of the screen which means to eject the disk (much likethat of AMax IIt for those of you who owned it). Aside from this, everything runs exactly like a Macintosh. One note: Some software is not "32-bit clean" and will require you to select 24-bit mode in the preferences screen. 24 bit mode will limit the amount of memory that you have available for the emulation. I highly recommend you install Apple System 7.1 or greater, otherwise you will be forced to use the inefficient 24-bit mode. The graphics speed with my EGS Spectrum is about 50% faster than that of a standard Mac II when run in 256 color mode. However, in 24-bit mode the graphics speed is extremely slow (much like 16 color mode on the Workbench of an ECS Machine). On my Amiga 3000/25, Emplant emulates a Mac IIci, and on an A4000/40 it is supposed to emulate a Quadra 650(?).

Unless you have a high-density disk drive, do not expect to be able to read Macintosh disks in your Amiga disk drives (unless you happen to have an A-Max cartridge and a Mac Drive, or AMIA). Having a highdensity disk drive will allow you to read Macintosh High Density diskettes, but not the low density variety. To read the low-density (which are fairly rare) you will need either AMIA or an A-Max Cartridge &amp; Mac drive. (Note: if you have an A-Max cartridge &amp; Mac drive you will not be able to use then inside the Mac emulation, instead you have to use an included "converter" program to convert the disks to EMPLANT format so that they can be used in the emulation. AMIA is able to read Macintosh lowdensity disks inside the Mac emulation).

Another thing is the speed of the Emulation. I have to say that it is very impressive. I am only sorry that I cannot include a Speedometer report in this review (as my

Multitasking on the Emplant is very good. You can switch to and from the Macintosh and Amiga Workbench screens. Though if you only have four megs of Fast RAM you probably will want to disable Workbench to get the most memory out of Emplant. With my eight megs of Fast RAM, the most memory I am able to get out of the Emplant is about 5.7 megs of Macintosh memory. You are able to set the task priority of the Emplant software as high as 0. Any higher (according to J. Drew) and it would cause the emulation to actually run slower. According to Xoper, when there is little load on my Amiga side, the Macintosh Emulation can take up almost ALL of the available CPU time; however, when I am doing something processor intensive on the Amiga, the Macintosh side will lower its CPU usage to about 50% or possibly even lower. I have experienced some crashes while downloading on the Amiga side at high speed, and doing some other stuff on the Mac. Overall, the system seems slightly less stable when running the Emplant software, but it is not too bad.

Macintosh system got corrupted yesterday), but maybe in a later post. Well, about the speed of the Mac emulation. According to Speedometer, my 25-mhz 030 runs at the same speed as a 25mhz 030 Macintosh would run.... But the surprise comes with Floating Point operations. My floating point speed was anywhere from 5%-25% faster than an equivalent Macintosh!! This is very good for people into raytracing and rendering. I am told that the faster the CPU, the larger the floating point difference will be. So I wouldn't be surprised to see approximately about a 40% speed increase on floating point operations on an 040. Unless you are doing heaving multitasking on the Amiga side, you will find that your emulation will run faster than the equivalent Macintosh. The only thing that would slow you down would be graphics speed, but a good graphics card such as my EGS Spectrum would easily fix that problem.

The screen that the Emplant uses can be chosen by the user. Emplant supports multiple monitors like a real Macintosh if your graphics card supports it. Several graphics cards are supported, and by using a graphics card, you will not suffer from the slow ECS screens. On my EGS Spectrum, I am able to do 1024x768, 832x624, and 640x480. When using ECS or AGA you are able to select from the screen mode database. There is a QD mode that can be enabled for faster updates on 24 bit and ECS/AGA screens (not needed on 256 color screens as they are extremely fast already!) but it uses 128k more

The last issue I will cover is compatibility. I am sure many people are wondering how "compatible" is this emulation... Well, I have had only one problem so far. When installing OmniPage Pro v5.0, the Macintosh crashed, but I cannot be sure that it was the Emplant as I did not have the chance to reinstall it because it corrupted my Mac system, and now I am waiting for my highdensity drive so I can reinstall it. Here is a list of a 'few' programs that I run without any problems:

| MicroSoft Word 5.1a        | Z-Term 0.93            |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Now Utilities              | Norton Tools 2.0       |
| MacWrite Pro               | Cricket Graph III v1.5 |
| Spirit of Excalibur        | Sim City 2000          |
| MacSyndicate (slow on 030) | Civilization           |
| Adobe Photoshop 2.5.1      | Kai's Powertools       |
| Speedometer 3.0            | MPEG Play              |
| F-18 Flight Sim            | Deliverance            |
| DiskDoubler                |                        |

One thing to note.. Some Macintosh programs seem to run slower than their Amiga counterparts (even on Real Macs), so I take it either the custom chips (i.e. blitter, denise, etc) are helping out the Amiga program to make it more efficient, or the Mac programs are less efficient due to more colors, being larger, or some other reason. One good example is Syndicate — on the Macintosh it is highres 16 colors. But the play is excruciatingly slow even on an 030.

## OTHER SPECIAL FEATURES

Some of the "special" features of the Emplant that

make it really funto use are:

- Has support for virtual hard drives (hardfiles) so you can have your Macintosh boot from your Amiga Drive, though it is quite a bit slower that way.
- Has support for MANY graphics cards: EGS Spectrum, Piccolo, Retina ZII, Retina ZIII, EGS 110, Picasso, Merlin, Visona, plus ECS (2 or 16 color emulation), AGA (2, 16 and 256 color), etc.
- You can use the serial and SCSI ports from the Amiga side, though the empser device has no hardware handshaking so is useless above 2400 baud on the Amiga side (though a new empser.device is supposed to be out now with this problem fixed).
- The Emplant can redirect the Mac Serial &amp; Parallel to the standard Amiga ports, so you can use your modem and printer (if you have the correct printer driver).
- Share clipboards between the Macintosh and Amiga.
- Easy file transfers between Macintosh and Amiga.

## DOCUMENTATION

The Emplant board comes with two manuals. A hardware manual (15-pgs) which explains a lot of things about the Emplant hardware such as jumper settings and such. Also included is a new Macintosh Emulation guide. It is in a small three ring binder, and though black &amp; white only, it does appear to be a well thought out and prepared manual. There is a table of contents and a trouble shooting section; however, there is no index. The documentation tells you basically everything a beginner needs to know. Other advanced questions can be directed to tech support at (602) 680-9234.

## LIKES

The thing I like most about the product is the peaceful coexistence of the Macintosh and the Amiga. Little things like being able to copy text from the Mac side and paste (via clipboard) on the Amiga side and vice versa make the Emplant a nice product. Some other things that Ilike are the quick and easy file transfers, which allows me to download a Macintosh program on my Amiga side and make a Mac binary transfer to the Mac side.

## DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The thing that I dislike is lack of hardware handshaking on the current empser. device, and myself not being able to use the MMU of my machine. Utilities Unlimited said that if I were to use the EC version of the software I could use my MMU, but as of yet I still have had no luck. This prevents me from using a few software programs on the Mac side such as virtual memory. Also the problem with the empser.device is annoying, yet doesn't affect the Macintosh side.

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

The only other similar product would be A-Max IV, which is also a color Macintosh emulator. I have heard only good things about A-MAX IV, but because I don't have one, I am unable to do a comparison.

I do, however, have the older A-MAX II. According to Speedometer, Emplant is faster in ALL tests (I am unable to provide the output of the speedometer test because my Mac system is down right now, I may put it in another post though). I am not surprised that Emplant is faster since the older A-Max II only emulated a Mac Plus.

I notice that when I use my Workbench with my EGS Spectrum (at 256 colors), and the Mac side is doing something on its screen, I get garbage on my Workbench screen which I have to clear by selecting ResetWB in the pull-down menus. I asked Jim Drew about this, and he gave me a reason for this once (in a post on USENET), but I cannot remember the exact reason, but I would think that it could be solved??? (Note: There is no such problem if you are running in only AGA or ECS mode, or if the Macintosh is running on an EGS Spectrum screen and my Workbench is on a standard ECS Screen. There is only the garbage problem when BOTH the Mac and the Amiga use an EGS Screen). I believe this happens with the Piccolo as well.

## VENDOR SUPPORT

Excellent! The first board I had happened to be defective and only worked on occasion. I called Utilities Unlimited and they told me to send it back. I did so and three days later I had a brand new board with updated manuals and the latest version of the software!

## WARRANTY

There is a Lifetime warranty. Also I should also talk about the upgrade policy. To upgrade from a lower model Emplant to a higher model, you only send in the

## Famous Last Words

- Don't worry, I can handle it.
- You and what army?
- If you were as smart as you think you are, you wouldn't be a cop.

no other "hidden" upgrade costs.

## CONCLUSION

This is an excellent product, and I give it five out of five stars! Aside from the minor quirks, it works flawlessly, and even runs faster than the equivalent Macintosh.

## Cray For Sale Cheap!

technology marches on by Jim Sanders - ABACUS

all it a symbol of technological obsolescence or a once the world's fastest computational device, is now sitting in a south San Francisco warehouse, where it will either be sold to a collector or get melted down to recover the 5 tons of copper, gold and other materials inside it.

"We got our money's worth out of it" ', said Derrol Hammer, a purchasing agent at the lab. It ran for over 10 years, 24 hours a day. But Hammer said that it cost more than $35,000 a month to run the Cray I, a cylindrical machine that is 7 feet tall and 9 feet in diameter and requires its own electrical substation to provide it with power.

Hayward businessman, Tony Cole, bought the supercomputer for $10,000 at a surplus equipment auction at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. When purchased new in the late 1970's, the Cray I cost $19 million, lab officials said.

A desktop workstation or the Sun type or a Silicon Graphics workstation that we can put on a desk is a Cray I equivalent. You can buy a workstation for the monthly cost of maintenance on the Cray I.

So Livermore pulled the plug on the aging supercomputer and began asking other government and university labs if they wanted the 10,000 pound digital dinosaur. When no takers surfaced, the lab auctioned it off.

Enter Tony Cole, 29, founder of VIPC Computers, a firm that salvages useful components or scrap metals from surplus computers. Cole offered the highest of 7 bids and he is sure he can get his money back on the scrap value of the gold in it.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga Central Bill Raecke

Since the notes from the official Amiga Central Secretary didn't make it this month, I'll just jot a few quick lines to catch you up on the latest chapter news. The October meeting started with the presentation of the nominations for club officers. This list is prepared each year by the outgoing Board of Directors and is presented to the membership as a proposed slate. The officer list is printed elsewhere in the newsletter. There were no further nominations from the floor. The election will be held at the November chapter meetings.

and a history lesson for those Amiga owners who haven't had their computers since the beginning. Harold Williams showed animations beginning with the original Boing demo and progressing through the years. Most of them have held up well and are still quite entertaining. And most still run just fine on a Workbench 2.1 machine. To finish off the evening, I showed excerpts from a videotape of the Amiga World Premiere back in 1985. It was a pretty impressive show.

The big news for the evening concerned the future of the Amiga Central chapter. As most of you read in last month's newsletter or heard about at the September meeting, the Amiga Central chapter is loosing its meeting place due to a radical price increase being implemented at the Arlington Community Center. This initially had us looking for a new space to meet — as was reported last month. A substitute space was located, although with significant drawbacks (a 9:00 closing time, smaller space, no stage, no TV). But the search got us thinking about alternatives...and longing for the good old days when a chapter meeting meant 75 to 100 people packed into a room. So, at the October meeting, the current chapter officers recommended dissolving the Amiga Central chapter. The dissolution will mean larger attendance at both the Amiga ByThe-Loop chapter and the Amiga North Dallas chapter and it should result in more interesting meetings as well - and it will make finding 1995 chapter officers easier. The chapter will continue meeting at usual until the end of the year.

The presentation was a walk down memory lane for many of us -

Be sure to join us for our November meeting. We'll be voting on MCCC officers and seeing another astounding presentation...this time by David Campbell.

## Amiga North Dallas Genny White

Our dwindling numbers were still represented by a lively dozen at our October gathering. Perhaps the rest of you were intimidated by the impending officer nominations... I knew it was wise to be present, to avoid being nominated for something in absentia! Seriously, folks, some wonderful chapter members have stepped forward for our officer positions for next year, so it's safe to come back! Our acting President, Steve Nichols has agreed to take on the role officially, and has been doing an excellent job since President Danny got his evening employment. Offering to step in as Treasurer is Don Sobiek, and as Chapter Librarian we have John Cummings. Recent-comer Michael Turner has accepted nomination as Secretary. Any other nominations may be made at the November meeting, and we'll make these folks official in December. Please support our officers with your prayers, your presence, your gifts, and your service! (apologies to the Methodist Service: seemed very appropriate right about now.) A personal word: I have very much enjoyed being your secretary these past several years (since the chapter began), and I regret all the complexities of life which keep me too busy to continue. You're a fine bunch of folks, and I hope I can continue to visit MCCC once in a while to keep in touch. Please speak s-1-o-w-l-y for Michael, and spell things you want to see in print correctly! Thanks to those of you who have filled in for me when life got in the way this past year. Ill try to make the last two meetings of '94 with my trusty pencil and pad in hand.

There was a brief discussion held on "Why do we exist?", , in lieu of any news, views, or rumors to start the meeting. It is kinda lonely, having a user group and no manufacturer at present, but at least there's hope! Software houses are still getting software (games, etc.) for AGA machines and CD32, mainly from Europe. As no official word has come down on the fate of Commodore, we wait, hoping our machines will someday be back in the spotlight and a going concern once again. Meanwhile, MCCC as a whole goes on, and we salute the club officers (whose nominations we officially accepted) for courageously carrying on. We considered very briefly merging with another chapter, but the general response was "nyahh...". We'll stick together and stick it out. Interesting note: Amigas might be found on clearance tables at Montgomery Wards locations, as they don't seem to have any other use for them. Good source for spare parts cheap.

After the officers discussion and various doom-and-gloom thoughts, Steve Nichols brightened the mood with a nice presentation on Final Copy II.

with it. This word processor package has a nice interface with easy access to layout controls via a toolbox. Among the toolbox buttons were windows for page size and shape, headers and footers, columns, hyphenation, etc. Special features for this application included a merging facility (i.e. mailing list merged into a form letter, for example), structured graphics (the insertion of lines, boxes, borders, etc. into the text), and the ability to embed standard IFF images in your document. You can alter the color of your fonts and graphics (and you can see what you've done in color if you choose the Workbench style of display). An eye-opening example was using white text to write over a dark picture image. (Can you overwrite an image with any other package?) There's also a spellchecker and a thesaurus online. The same software company makes the much more elaborate (and expensive) product Final Writer. Steve distributed a goofy but very impressive 3-page "newsletter" produced with the package, with many different font styles, boxes, borders, columns, and images interspersed with his witty text. I, for one, am glad to see there are still new and interesting things to see on the Amiga!

Don't forget METCOM on November 5th! There'll be something worth coming for at our November chapter meeting, as well. Hope to see you there.

## Metro C64/128 Brenda Sessums

Ding how Metro C-64/128 Users! We got a little behind with the news over the past couple of months, so now it's time to play catch up. Here goes:

Well, we had nursery hour along with our September meeting packed full of 16 wonderful people. Amy Adams, Brenda Sessums' daughter, brought her children, Beth and Michael, and Phil brought his grandbaby.

Alive!" and "Loadstar." These ondisk magazines are totally devoted to the 8-bitters, and the "C-64 Alive!" is currently being included in your membership. Wowsers!

John Sookma has resigned as treasurer, to meet a higher calling — he and Julia now have a baby girl! The post of treasurer will have to be filled now, and Jo Lynn looks like she is seriously eyeing it. Oops, that would leave the position of chapter president open - gads! Well, elections will be soon, so think if there is a club post you might like to fill this year. Remember, you don't have to be a know-it-all about Commodores, just be interested in them (and if you are reading this, you already are interested!).

Commodore Country donated several copies of Geos for club members to take home for their very own. They also donated some wonderful door prizes. Thanks, Brad and Debbie! The great door prizes we had this month were: "Pool of Radiance" "Flight Simulator" "Baseball", "Hillsfar", , and "Super Huey".

Phil downloaded some great software add-ons for "Sky Travel" that lets you see landmarks such as the Golden Gate and the Eifel Tower! Jack Tarvin wrote his congressmen on the Chrysalis BBS using E-mail (electronic mail) on the Internet. He said it would have cost him $10 to send the message over express mail, but he didn't have to pay anything for the message on Chrysalis! Not only that, he got a message back in about an hour! Who'd have thought that government could do anything this fast! Jack said he is going to be getting a list of the Internet addresses electronic mailboxes) of other Senators and Congressmen. Now we have a new way to keep a finger on the pulse of government. Thanks for the info, Jack! Of course, you can use Internet for even more than government communiques. Mike got E-Mail back from England

Jo Lynn showed us a couple of newsletters done on "Fun Graphics Machine." "Hawaii Online" was a newsletter of the Commodore Hawaii Users Group. It had several ads, articles, and fun little graphics on the cover. Three such graphics were a Hawaiian hoola girl in a grass skirt, Wakikki Beach &amp; Diamond Head, and a surfer hangin' ten. The other newsletter had even better graphics. It was the Lane County Commodore Users Group from Eugene, Oregon. It carried one of the same articles the other had, "The Curse of the Graphics Densities" by J. Blewitt. This article was a "general discourse about Commodore graphics." There was an ad about a barcode reader "NX-Barcoder Ver. 5" and other great stuff. Every article had fabulous, creative graphics. One ad showed two Geos support disks that are available from Nathan Fiedler in Pennsylvania. Wow! The Geos Utilities Disk is $13 and contains AutoAlarm, BlackOut, Chaos, DeleteHFP, DirPrint, DIsBAM, DiskProtect, EggTimer, FileLock, FindFile/FindFile128, HeaderEditor, LockScreen, Login, SewSysErr, PatchConvert, PhotoPrint, Pointer128, RAMTest, Redirect, Save Wiz, SysInfo, UnMakeGEOS, GeoDump, NoPictures, and Scrn80Grab. Nate also has a Routines Disk and a GeoProg Info Disk available. For more information, write Nathan at 5711 Mt. Pleasant Road, Bernville, PA 19506-9313.

If you haven't already noticed, the September "Compute" was the last. This was really no great loss, since they had actually stopped supporting the Commodore side some time ago, and wanted to offer IBM subscriptions in place of them. No thanks! We'll stick with "C-64

and Japan the same day he wrote them a message. Wow! Looks like Jack and Mike are out cruising the information superhighway our nation's VP has been talking about!

game. In Nielson-speak, we lost some market share.

Does anyone know how to use "Better Working Business Forms"? Jo Lynn desperately needs assistance here. A couple of members played around with it at the meeting, but if someone has used it before, please let Jo Lynn know. Brenda gave a demo of "Create With Garfield" graphics workshop. First, she gave a slide show with Garfield doing famous feats of wonder — eating, sleeping, messing with Odie - you know, normal Garfield activities. It was like watching the Sunday funnies scroll (slowly) by. Then she showed us how to make up our own cartoon panel with Garfield and all his friends. After that, she sent the pandl to print in color!

By the way, we need your input. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO AT THE MEETINGS?? If you don't tell us, we won't know and may give demonstrations of stuff you don't even care about seeing. This is YOUR club, and YOUR meetings. You can be a little selfish just this once. Sooooo, just tell one of the officers what you are interested in. Also, what do you do with your computer? What would you like to do with your computer? Play games, write newsletters, play music, or draw pictures? Let

Those members whose membership has expired or is about to expire should take a few minutes to renew today. The meetings are fun and informative, you can get copies of PD (public domain) software from the chapter library, download great software from the MCCC BBS, get free tech help, a great newsletter, and the "C-64 Alive!" disk magazine packed with wonderful things for your Commodore.

Many things were discussed at the Board of Directors meeting last month. There was the news about METCOM. For one, there will not be a contest this year. The main problem was that the officers wanted to make sure that the products needed form, and tell you how to label your items. Each item you sell is identified by four digits (e.g., AA01). The first letter is the chapter code, and the second letter is the member code. Numbers such as "01" mean this is the first item on the sales list the member filled out.

Election time is here again, so vote at the polls to elect your government and your club officers. The roster of club officers selected by the present Board of Directors was presented at the meeting. There were no other nominations. The election will be held in November. Also in November, nominations will be taken for chapter officers for the C-64/128 Users. There will probably be a change in the current player's lineup for our chapter, leaving holes

## MCCC 1995 Officer Nominations

The slate below is proposed by the current Board of Directors. This month, 1995 officers will be elected from this list and any additional candidates which may have been nominated at October meetings.

that need to be filled, possibly by yourself. Jo Lynn has expressed a desire to step down from the presidency and into the role of treasurer. Brenda may seek a post that doesn't require Mike to work so much. In any case, at the next meeting, be sure to vote and/or volunteer.

everyone know, and share some of what you do! Our thanks to all the members who made the September meeting great fun and interesting for the rest of us.

Only eight people showed for the October meeting, but they were the cream of the crop! We had the misfortune of being in the same time slot this month as the Texas/OU

"The Underground" (Issue 4, September 94) has an article about making a printer interface with an old Vicmodem. And luckily, we were given a Vicmodem by Commodore Country. Phil says that it is real easy to make one, and it only takes about 20 minutes. It speeds up printing and allows you to hook up to any Centronics donated to METCOM for door prizes were not spread too thin by keeping a few aside for contest winners. We also discussed the fact that volunteers are needed to help set up on the Saturday morning of METCOM between 8-10 a.m. Any items you want to sell at the flea market should be given to Phil Heberer. He can help you fill out the

printer (such as for IBM &amp; Amiga). Subscription forms were passed out for "Die Hard" and "Commodore World". These are excellent Commodore-specific magazines and are highly recommended. "Texas Computing" was also available as a freebee for take home, and "BBS Magazine" (which has a Commodorespecific column each month.

## CHAPTER NEWS

Jo Lynn has a 128D with a Monitor for sale at $300. Jo Lynn bought this outfit for her mother, but mom said she wanted a word processor instead. What the hey? Word processing is one of the many great tasks the Commodores can handle.

CMD is trying to get the rights to produce proprietary chips so we can have backups in case of a ... gasp! ... hardware failure. The other option in the mean time is to get a backup Commodore to either steal chips from or to use if your main one goes toes up.

Jo Lynn demonstrated "The Will Kit". We discovered that this was the same one that John Burt showed us several months ago. Brenda asked if there was a provision for cats in the will. Jo Lynn said that they fall under the children category! Jo Lynn and Phil helped troubleshoot "The Write Stuff" wordprocessor for Harry Bradley. Topics included "setting headers" and "tabs". Luckily, "The Write Stuff" has a hypertext manual. That means you can hit a "help key" and it brings up menus with "hot key" commands. It is very handy!

Does anyone know of a good genealogy program for the C-64 or 128 that supports GEDCOM? Mary Louise is looking for one. Phil recommended "Family Tree", which is old but excellent. However, it doesn't support GEDCOM, the international genealogy data exchange format for computers (GEDCOM). Another format is Tiny Taffel, but that is more of an quick ASCII database for viewing certain brief facts about each member in your family tree and listing on appropriate FIDO echo. Anyone have any ideas? If you have a program for the Commodore that supports GEDCOM, you can trade files with other researchers using their IBMs, Macs or what have you, and also the LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints)

depository in Utah and locally.

We had some wonderful door prizes this month, and everything but the word processor was from Commodore Country. Leonard won "Temple of Apshi" . Harry won a word processor for the 128, which he will trade for something on the 64. Mary Louise won "Pro Golf". (I didn't catch who got the other goodies, sorry guys!) Mary Louise graciously let us play with "Pro Golf". The controls were a little confusing at first, but it was great fun to play. First, you selected your club by moving the joystick, then clicking the fire button when you had the club you wanted. Your golfer then took out that club and walked over to the tee, waiting for your swing. Then you controlled your swing by moving the joystick back for the backswing, and forward for the follow through. Be sure to watch out for the wind! Mike beat Jo Lynn on one hole with 15 strokes to her 11 strokes. (Wait a minute, isn't the winner the one with the lower score? Hmmmm. Nah.)

Kathy Cole gave us a wonderful music program and midi keyboard demonstration. She brought in two keyboards, an Akai AX80 and a SIEL DK70, that she connected into the Commodore via a Sentech midi interface plugged into the user (cartridge) port. Wowsers! Sentech's phone is (800) 637-6509. Kathy demonstrated "The Music Shop for

Midi" by Broderbund. It is really nice and will even print out sheet music for you! She said it is out of print, but another fine program called "Dr. T's" is still sold by CMD for mucho bucks. There are two types of programs: step entry and real-time entry. Step entry lets you write music by note on the screen with the keyboard and save it to disk. "The Music Shop" lets you do this with simple cutting and pasting of notes onto a musical staff. Real-time entry lets you connect up a midi keyboard and "write" your music by playing notes on the keyboard. "Midi Pro 64" was also demonstrated and allowed real-time entry from the keyboard. This one is professionally written. Kathy calls it a word processor for music because you can do so much editing — by note, by track, tempo, swap, bounce or move tracks, etc. Kathy said there are a few commercial programs currently available that are very good for this type of entry. Another program called "Super Sequencer 64" is hotkey driven. That's why the manual is very important. With this program, you an go in and quickly edit each individual note. "The Music Printer GS" excels at printing out musical scores. However, it won't print out eighth-note triplets. That is something that is very necessary in scoring jazz pieces. "Music Shop for Midi" has a triplet bracket you can add to eighth-notes and print out. Both programs have give and takes, and the "Music Printer GS" is still preferred for professional scoring. You can even add text such as lyrics and notation such as the italics p for pianissimo or f for forte. If you want a crescendo, you type cres. instead of drawing the crescendo. "Music Shop for Midi" doesn't allow text input on your scores.

Thanks to all the people who made the October meeting a success. We really had fun. See you next month, and don't forget METCOM!
