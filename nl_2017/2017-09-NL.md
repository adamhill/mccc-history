## My Early Amiga Experiences

Back  in  1987  a  KBS  lab  coworker brought his A3000 up there that he had put 'Firepower' on to its harddrive and got it working from a commandline prompt. The very colorful graphics combined with the stereo soundtrack of the tank running and running  over  enemy  soldiers  was mesmerizing. There were no roads, just  open  land  in  every  direction. We could then go straight to the enemy's  flag  structure  and  capture  it, then barely make it back before losing too many resources as that darn helicopter  began  chasing  the  tank, too. It was harrowing and extremely fun  to  play.  No  Microsoft  PC  could match that. Time just slipped away as  you  were trying to capture that flag  while  squishing  running-away enemy soldiers and seeing their red blood spurting out in all directions from then being run over. And, also rescuing your freed soldiers as well. That  was  very  dynamic,  and,  quite enjoyable in August of 1987. Made me want to buy one, but I couldn't afford $3,000 then for even that machine!

Then in 1992 at the Osteopathic Hospital in Fort Worth right down from the Amiga store 'Amazing Computers,'  somebody  brought  a  desktop A4000 from which they were playing  a  movie  from  the  harddrive where the hd light was NOT on continuously. With a VideoToaster board.  Again,  something  that  MS PCs could not do in 1992.

I then acquired a free A2000 from a coworker and started messing around  with  my  Amigas,  never  being able to duplicate that incredible 'Firepower' experience on. A future Amiga Club project?

## Vampires and 40 Years

In the continuing saga of 'Vampire Quest,,  I  am  still  waiting  to  hear back after finally sending payment for  the  board  some  time  back.  It's been some time, but a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of time I've waited (relatively patiently)  since  first  requesting  to  purchase a board, so I'll try to maintain that patience a while longer.

In  the  next  ironic  twist,  the  Apollo accelerator team announced the upcoming next-gen model while I wait for the last one. In perhaps the biggest  Amiga-related  news  in  a  long time (which was probably also Vampire news), the Vampire 'V4' boards were announced. These three new boards improve upon the previous, and all share the same base design. One is meant for the Amiga 500 and 2000  (and  600  with  an  optional adapter), one is for the A1200. presumably  plugging  into  the  CPU  expansion  slot,  and  the  third  is  the 'standalone,'  a  complete  system  unto itself, not too surprising considering  how  much  current  Vampire cards supplant the Amiga hardware they attach to. Time will tell exactly how  well  legacy  compatibility  will be maintained without any original hardware or Kickstart  ROMs  (I  believe the Vampire will use an AROSderived Kickstart replacement), but I  am watching the standalone with great interest, especially if the price is reasonable.

The Apollo Vampire family of hardware  finally deliver on the 'enhanced  classic'  Amiga  idea  many apparently want to see, to go alongside the 'pure retro' of classic hardware and emulation, and the 'modernity  chasing'  of  OS4,  MorphOS, or AROS. If nothing else, these new  Vampire boards should  be made available through dealers such as AmigaKit, so actually getting one  should  be  a  far  simpler  and more definite process than I've been  subjected  to.  Would  anyone care to take bets on the potential of me ordering a Vampire standalone, and  it  beating  the  V600  to  my home?

Continuing the chronicle of my forty years  in  computing  (and  gaming) from where I left off previously, at a point  where  I  joined  the  Internet world in 1996. Connecting an Amiga to  the  Internet  via  dialup  modem was  a  bit  more  challenging  then than it is now, especially before the appearance of intuitive TCP/IP stacks like Miami. Regardless, I plowed  ahead  and  set  up  my  own web  site  and  accompanying  comic strip,  known  as  'Sabrina  Online,' which has run for over twenty years in  one  form or another by now. In gaming I got what would be the last brand-new  game  console,  a  Sony Playstation  (1).  It  would  join  my Amiga CD-32 and Atari Jaguar-two systems purchased cheap at the end of  their  life-span.  Still,  that  didn't stop  me  from  spending  on  games and  expansions  for  both  of  them, which kind of defeated the purpose of buying them on clearance (from the  defunct  Kay-Bee  toy  store)  or second-hand, but that seems to be a recurring  motif  for  me.  A  secondhand Sega Saturn and a clearanced Dreamcast would come later, being the  last  game  system  I  would  buy (or at least the last with gaming as a sole purpose).

As the new Millennium approached, I left behind the pipe dream that the Amiga would continue simply after the death of Commodore, and looked ahead to the upcoming PowerPC  systems  and  operating  systems like Amiga OS4 and MorphOS. At  the  time  (around  2000/2001) Morph and the Pegasos II (marketed  by  Genesi)  seemed  to  be  more ahead of the  game,  so  I  jumped  in, spending  over  a  thousand  for  the G4-based motherboard (I wanted to be able to say I had a 1 Ghz Amigastyle system), and more on top for the  case  and  supporting  hardware. In some ways I was disappointed as my over-hyped expectations of Amiga  compatibility  were  not  always met by the Pegasos and its MorphOS 1.4 operating system, but I found it very useful and far more powerful than the Amiga in several ways.

Sadly,  if  there  is  one  major  shortcoming of the Amiga and its related successors, it's that it was constantly lagging behind in support for Internet and web browsing standards, (or  perhaps  more  accurately,  the web  grew  more  tailored  to  dominant browsers like Firefox and Internet  Explorer)  which  became  more and more apparent in the  mid 2000s. As my use of the web grew, and  spurred  on  by  some  minor scares  and  repairs  with  my  Amiga and Morph systems, I felt the need for a system primarily for Internet usage, which turned out to be a Mac Mini G4 (only a year or two before Apple's switch to Intel architecture). The 'mostly for Internet' computer became an institution  in  my  home after that, freeing up the Amiga and MorphOS  machines  for  more  creative  and  productive  pursuits.  The Mac  led  to  the  Lenovo  laptop  running a lightweight Puppy  Linux

(with  its  window  manager  set  up for  an  interface  more  Amiga-like than Windows-like), which was eventually  replaced  with  an  ASUS laptop running Fatdog64 Linux (same  deal).  Meanwhile,  MorphOS moved  its  support  from  specific hardware like the Pegasos boards to several  models  of  PowerPC  Mac abandoned as Apple moved to Intel processors.  I  took  the  opportunity to get a second-hand PowerMac G5, which  proved  a  powerful  replacement for my Pegasos, and a G4 Powerbook,  which  I  got  much  less  use out of overall.

I could not escape the lure of mobile computing  either.  It  began  in  the middle-nineties  with  a  Psion  palmtop  computer.  It  was  primitive  by today's  standards,  not  a  lot  more than  a  glorified  organizer  with  a B&amp;W  LCD  screen  and  interaction only via its small keyboard. I bought it at the time for its relative similarity to the Amiga, having a multitasking  OS  and  ability  to  connect  and share files with an Amiga. I enjoyed it  quite  a  bit,  adding  a  program  to make  Star  Trek  computer  noises when turned on or off. I sent it in for repair when its screen was broken and received a brand new unit (at least I assume so, as wear and scuff marks on the case magically disappeared) I used it frequently until the ribbon cable connecting the screen to  the  other  half  of  the  clam  shell case  wore  out.  After  that,  I  moved on to the then-new Palm (formerly Palm Pilot) device, never fully adapting to its handwriting system. At the time I  was  amazed at  its  ability  to communicate by its IR  window, 'beaming' info or files to other Palm devices in its sight, which felt futuristic as hell at the time. I remember how  changing  batteries  on  the  device  was  like  handling  a  bomb,  as you  had  mere  seconds  to  change batteries or lose the memory on the system,  as  this  was  before  flash memory was in common usage, requiring  these  devices  to  rely  on backups  to  a  regular  computer  to avoid data loss.

inally  I  planned  multiple  possible uses  and  operating  environments for the Raspberry, but settled on the main use of travel retro game emulation, with a sideline of media player.

Later  I  upgraded  to  the  Palm  'LifeDrive,' a bulkier device with a color screen, 4 gigs of storage on an internal  hard  drive,  and  WiFi  Internet connectivity.  Palm  was  doing  the touch-screen  smartphone  thing  before  Apple  swooped  in  and  took over.  As  much  fun  as  the  various mobile  devices  were  to  me,  they were  more  novelties  than  necessities.  It  wasn't  until  around  2013 that I found something stronger in the  form  of  the  Samsung  Galaxy Note tablet. With it, I could do a lot of the Internet and media stuff my PCs did, and use its pen for drawing and graphics like I might do on the Amiga and Morph machines, even if I  spent  the  majority  of  tablet  time playing Angry Birds or YouTube videos. Nonetheless, I could see the potential,  and  where  my  computing might  go  in  the  future.  On  a  side note, I also got the inexpensive Raspberry  Pi  mini-systems,  versions  2 and 3. Following my game console trend,  I  spent  more  on  supporting hardware than the board itself. Orig-

Looking back on forty years of computing,  I  can  see  two  main  trends. One is that I have a strong affinity for  'underdog'  systems,  or  maybe just aversion to the  dominating ones. This seems to come out of me being an Amiga user for such a long period. I  tend  to  avoid  the  heavies, like Windows for computers and Apple  for  mobile  devices.  The  other trend  is  my  annoying  tendency  to throw lots of money at fleeting technology  fancies,  especially  obvious when the base machine was bought because  it was  inexpensive. I've done so several times in the past, so it's hard to expect it will stop. I never  quite  realized  how  many  different computer and gaming and mobile systems I've worked with in the forty years since that first Atari VCS crossed my path, and I suspect most  other  people  would  be  surprised  if  they  examined  their  own tech histories as well (especially if they  fell  for  the  old  scam  telling them they needed to upgrade every couple years). If you do look back on your own history of tech, be it computers,  game  machines,  mobile  devices,  or  even  just  electronics  in general, I hope you look on it fondly, as I have.
