Fort Worth

## My First 40 Years of Computing

I was asked what got me interested in the Atari and later what got me to move onto other computer platforms. So this is my story:

## 1977:

Dad  had  the  Sol  Terminal  20. Cool  machine.  Lots  of  Trek80 and  Targ  played.  We  got  a Sears Telegames system, which got us into Atari stuff. 1980:

Sold newspaper subscriptions and got my own Atari VCS. 1981:

Sold  the  VCS,  got  a  Atari  400 when I saw Choplifter, Miner2049er,  and  Archon  on the computer. Also learned about floppy disks and piracy!

## 1982:

Later  in  this  year  got  on  my first computer BBS.  Now  I could get games over the phone!  Whoo hoo!

## 1984:

Attended  Atari  user  meetings at the Dallas Infomart.

## 1986:

Dad had already upgraded the 400  to  48K,  but  installed  a Atari  1400  keyboard from Radio Shack.

## 1989:

Bear in mind, no Internet yet, really believed Atari was dead. Saw  a  friend's  Mac  SE  with Dark  Castle  and  managed  to score a Mac 128K. Later would upgrade that to 4 MB.

## April 2017

1993:

I  got  onto  the  text  Internet while in college computer labs. 1994:

While  in  Guam,  scored  a  Mac Plus.  Lots  of  BBSing  while  on the island.

## 1995:

I  saw my first graphical Internet  page  on  Mosiac.  (Didn't think it'd catch on.)

Dad gives me my first Newton 110  when  I  returned  from Guam.  At  first  didn't  know what to do with it.

First home  Internet service through a BBS (Chrysalis BBS in Dallas)

## 1996:

Picked up a  Performa  550 (68030) later upgraded to 68040 with math co-processor.

## 1997:

Picked up the amazing Newton 2000. 10x faster than my Newton 110. Played video!

Started  using  graphical  web browsers. (I was a slow adopter on that one.)

## 1999:

Out of college, found out Atari user  group  was  still  around. Borrowed  520  ST  (upgraded to 4 mb) for newsletter. Used Pagestream  and  had  a  laser printer!

## 2000:

Managed  to  score an Atari TT030, Lynx, Atari Jaguar.

Atari  user  group  folds  due  to having to move from the Infomart that they had for nearly fifteen years.

I  learned  of  Bubsy  Bobcat  on the Jaguar!

## Dallas

Continued using TT030 alongside Performa 550 for Internet. Featured  in  the  Dallas  Morning News: Atari Jaguar on front cover.

I  met  the  local  Dallas  Amiga User Group as they were also in the newspaper article.

## 2001:

Got an IT job, used a Athlon 1 Ghz processor with Win98. Later used Linux. Still tinkered with  retro  computers  (Atari XE and ST).

Got my first DVD player as the spiritual  successor  to  the  Jaguar, the Nuon Samsung 2000.

## 2002:

Scored two Macintosh G3 Powerbooks  for  my  wife  and  I.  I was back in the Mac world using OS 9.

## 2003:

Joined Amiga User Group. They helped me get an Amiga 3000 working that I picked up at JagFest in 2002 in Austin, TX. Even had a Ethernet card!

Attended the JagFest in St. Louis (while visiting wife's family).

## 2004:

Upgraded to OS X.3

## 2005:

Won  the  retro-challenge  (like the  first  or  second  year  of  it) using nothing but an Atari 800 for one month.

Figured out I didn't need portable computing right before smart phones. My Newton 2000  and  Duo  Macs  became used less.

I  was  handed  a  G4  12"  800 mhz  Powerbook.  Beautiful  little computer! Well I was hand- ed it in parts and I managed to reassemble it.

Tinkered  heavy  in  the  Dreamcast after a friend showed me that system.

For the next five years lots of calling BBSs and Internet with beige  Atari  800.  Many  discussions  over  Atariage  and  Atari IRC channels.

## 2008:

Started the Bubsy Fan Blog.

## 2010:

Got a Macbook Pro dual Core processor laptop in parts. Fixed  it  up.    Hated  it.  Traded for 1.2 Ghz G4 12" laptop. Used that  G4  through  my  time  in Kuwait along with a 1.4 Ghz G4 Mac Mini.

## 2011:

My first Android device, the Archos  32,  and  my  first  experience with Angry Birds!

## 2012:

Got my first Intel iMac 1.5 Ghz from a sidewalk sale.

## 2014:

Picked up a Amiga 500 from a friend. Fixed it up to 8 MB and SD card slot. Then got a Amiga 1200.

This  was  also  the  year  I  tinkered hard on the Intellivision and used it to call Atariage and leave  messages.  Also  created concept for the dual action controller.

## 2015:

Picked  up  a  Macbook  Air  1.8 Ghz from a friend.  (What I'm using to write this.)

Helped with some development and testing on Atari Jaguar  games.    Mainly  Joust  and Moon Patrol.

2016:

Picked up a 27" iMac 2.7 Ghz 32 GB RAM from a friend. Set  up  Internet  server  on  the Newton 2000 for a while. Bubsy Fan Blog interviews Bubsy creator Michael Berlyn. Got the Atari Flashback Portable from Atgames that gets me back into the Atari 2600. Helped in testing hundreds of games to see what is compatible with the SD card slot. Then worked with fan hackers to get dozens  more  tuned  up  and working.

2017:

Got  the  Sega  Flashback  Portable from Atgames, causing me to  get  into  some  tinkering  on Sega Genesis.

To date,  Bubsy  Bobcat  Fan Blog on Atariage has had 175,398 visitors.

Still  call  computer  BBSs  and write a blog on that as well.

And local Amiga user group in Dallas,  TX  is  still  active  with live YouTube broadcasts every month.

Wow, 40 years of computing.  Been a fun ride.

## One Billion Hours of YouTube Per Day

The amount of video that YouTube users around the world watch each day  is  now  almost  as  much  as  all U.S.  TV  watching  combined,  The Wall Street  Journal  reported  on Monday.

The amount of video footage viewed on YouTube is growing and passed 1 billion hours a day, parent company Alphabet told the Journal, while Nielsen data shows the 1.25 billion  hours  of  TV  watched  and recorded  in  America  each  day  is shrinking.

The  viewership  numbers  on  YouTube mark a 10-fold increase since 2012, the company told the Journal and compare to 116 million hours streamed  on  Netflix  and  100  million  hours  streamed  on  Facebook. CNBC has reached out to Google for comment.

YouTube's viewership is a key metric  for  analysts  that  cover  Alphabet's  stock,  as  it  is  one  of  the  few big  streams  of  money  that  is  not disclosed in Google's earnings. The Journal reports that it generated $4 billion  in  revenue  and  broke  even in 2014, citing anonymous sources familiar with the division's finances.
