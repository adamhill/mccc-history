## A History of the Amiga, Part 10: The Downfall of Commodore

As the 1990s began, Commodore should have been flying high. The longawaited new Amiga models with better graphics, the A1200 and A4000, were finally released in 1992. Sales responded  by  increasing  17  percent  over  the previous year. The Video Toaster had established  a  niche  in  desktop  video editing  that  no  other  computer  platform could match, and the new Toaster 4000 promised to be even better than before.  After  a  rocky  start,  the  Amiga seemed to be hitting its stride.

Unfortunately, this success wouldn't last. In 1993, sales fell by 20 percent, and Commodore lost $366 million.  In  the  first  quarter  of  1994,  the company announced a loss of $8.2 million-much  better  than  the  previous four  quarters,  but  still  not  enough  to turn a profit. Commodore had run into financial  difficulties  before,  particularly  in  the  mid-'80s,  but  this  time  the wounds  were  too  deep.  Sales  of  the venerable  Commodore  64  had  finally collapsed, and the Amiga wasn't able to fill the gap quickly enough. The company  issued  a  statement  warning  investors  of  its  problems,  and  the  stock plunged.  On  April  29,  1994,  Commodore International Limited announced that it was starting the initial phase of voluntary liquidation of all of its assets and  filing  for  bankruptcy  protection. Commodore,  once  the  savior  of  the Amiga, had failed to save itself.

Why did this happen? Was it inevitable, or could the company have made different  choices  and  kept  both  itself and the Amiga  platform alive  and healthy?

There are those who would argue the former. Computing platforms tend to  start  with  many  different  competitors and then slowly dwindle down to one or two survivors. IBM so dominated the mainframe industry in the 1960s that it was referred to as 'Snow White,'  with  more  market  share  than the 'Seven Dwarves' combined. Those seven became five and then essentially one  after  mergers  and  acquisitions. There  were  more  than  100  personal computer  platforms  in  the  early  '80s, but  by  1994  only  two  remained  that sold enough to be measurable: PC compatibles at 91 percent share and Macintoshes  at  9  percent.  More  recently, we've seen a diverse market of smartphone  platforms whittled  down  to leave just two: Android at 88 percent and iPhones at 12 percent.

But  is  the  survival  of  more  than two  computing  platforms  an  ironclad law  of technology  or  just a coincidence?  There  are  exceptions-game consoles  went  through  two  separate generations with three viable competitors:  Nintendo,  Sega,  and  Sony  in  the 1990s,  and  Nintendo,  Microsoft,  and Sony from the 2000s until present-day. In addition, a declining market share is not  irreversible.  The  Macintosh,  after hitting  a  low  of  under  two  percent  in 2003, has since rebounded to a healthy 7.5 percent. Could a trio of PCs, Macintoshes,  and  Amigas  have  coexisted  in an alternate universe?

I think so. Saving the  Amiga wouldn't have been easy, but it definitely was possible. Ultimately, the failure rests  with  Commodore  management, who not only failed to adapt to a changing  marketplace,  but  in  many  cases were actively hostile to their own company. To understand what they did and why they  did  it,  we  have  to  jump  far back in time-to the creation of Commodore itself.

## Jack Tramiel sells his soul

Jack Tramiel founded  Commodore in 1955, leveraging his experiences repairing typewriters after the war to build up a small stable of office products,  including  adding  machines.  Jack was  a  Holocaust  survivor,  and  his  aggressive,  take-no-prisoners  approach to business sometimes got him in trouble. In 1965, he was involved in a scandal when the Alliance Acceptance Corporation, a Canadian financial company, suddenly collapsed. Tramiel had close ties to Alliance, and although he was not indicted, the scandal wrecked Commodore. To survive, Tramiel was forced to sell a large share of his company to Irving Gould, a Canadian financier. Gould now held the purse strings.

Irving Gould was a jet-setting man who didn't like to spend a lot of time managing the  company,  preferring  instead to let Tramiel handle the day-today  operations  while  he  took  care  of the finances. For a while, this strategy worked  well.  The  purchase  of  MOS Technologies (the company that made the legendary 6502 CPU that powered most  8-bit  computers),  the  release  of the PET, and the success of the VIC-20 and Commodore 64 all happened during this time.

However, Gould grew increasingly intolerant of Tramiel's one-man management  style.  Tramiel  also  said  that he wanted to issue more stock to pay off  Commodore's  massive  debts,  but Gould  refused,  arguing  that  it  would weaken his hold on the company. What Gould didn't say was that much of Commodore's debt was to other companies that Gould also controlled.

Their  disagreements  came  to  a head when Tramiel criticized Gould for using Commodore's assets (such as the company jet) for personal reasons. Jack said: 'You can't do this while I'm president,' to which Gould responded, 'Goodbye.'

Gould then arranged to force Tramiel  out  of  his  own  company  while forming a series of increasingly flimsy excuses:  first  that  although  Jack  had brought the company to its first billion in sales, he wasn't the one to get them to  ten  billion.  Then,  he  believed  that Jack was trying to position his sons to take over the company.

In any case, Gould managed to get Tramiel  to  suddenly  resign  from  the company he founded in 1984. Without Jack,  Commodore  had  lost  its  soul, much  as  Apple  had  when  Steve  Jobs was kicked out. Gould then proceeded to hand-pick a series of CEOs with little or no experience in the personal computing  industry.  Some,  like  Marshall Smith,  were  terrible,  whereas  others, like Thomas  Rattigan, managed to bring the company back to profitability. One  thing  was  consistent,  however: Commodore CEOs, like hockey coaches, were hired to be fired.

Gould was out of his element, so in 1986 he turned to what many incompetent and desperate managers utilize: a  management  consulting  company. The  company  he  hired,  Dillon-Read, sent over a managing director named Mehdi  Ali.  Ali  spent  many  years  and many  millions  of  dollars  to  come  up with  the  recommendation  that  Gould should  hire  Mehdi  Ali  to  be  the  new CEO of Commodore International, which Gould finally  did  in  1989.  This was  the  exact  moment  when  Commodore sealed its doom.

## Mehdi's mistakes

Ali's  reign  at  Commodore  can  be characterized  by  three  main  aspects: costly  strategic  errors,  cutting  essential  research  and  development  (R&amp;D), and  increasing  the  CEO's  compensation. The latter was no small thing. In 1989, Ali received $1.38 million in salary. In 1990, that figure rose to $2 million (not including bonuses), and Irving  Gould  scored  a  40  percent  pay raise  to  $1.75  million.  By  comparison, the  CEO  of  IBM,  John  Akers,  received $713,000 in the same year.

Mehdi missed or flubbed several key opportunities during this time. One of the most egregious was killing a deal with Sun Microsystems, which wanted to license both Amiga Unix (AMIX) and Amiga hardware for their low-end workstations.  Ali  sabotaged  the  deal twice by demanding increasingly outrageous licensing fees.

Ali  sat  back  and  watched as new companies  grew  faster  and  faster  by filling  in  the  gaps  in  Amiga  hardware that  Commodore  refused  to  provide, such as hard drives and CPU upgrades. The largest of these, GVP, ended up being  worth  over  half  the  value  of  Commodore  itself,  which  was  unheard  of for a peripheral company. Those were all dollars that could have gone directly into Commodore's pocket.

Mehdi  was  also  responsible  for producing the worst Amiga ever created-the Amiga 600. Intended to be a cost-reduced 500, it was released with fewer  features  than  its  cousin  for  a higher price. Ali doubled down on this failure by making sure that stores were flooded with A600s that nobody wanted while failing to manufacture enough A500s and A1200s that people actually did.

But the greatest harm that Ali inflicted  on  Commodore  was  selling  its future. Over the years, he continued to gut  R&amp;D  funding  until  there  was  almost nothing left.

At its announcement in 1985, the Amiga was years  ahead  of  its  time.  It had features like preemptive multitasking, a color GUI, and hardware graphics and sound acceleration that would not become mainstream on computers until  over  a  decade  later.  However,  the team that created the Amiga was keenly  aware that it should be continually improved.  Jay  Miner,  the  designer  of the  Amiga's  chipset,  had  nearly  completed an updated version of the chips codenamed  'Ranger'  that  increased speed,  resolution,  and  color  support. Bizarrely,  Commodore  never  shipped these  advances,  instead  opting  for  a much less powerful spec bump on the Amiga  500  and  2000  (the  Enhanced Chip Set, or ECS). But the company did start  work  on  a  huge  revamp  of  the Amiga  chipset  in  1988  called  the  Advanced Amiga Architecture, or AAA.

AAA was a bold step forward for the Amiga, but it did not fare well in the hands of Ali's cost-cutting. By the time Commodore folded in 1994, there was only  a  single  engineer  working  on  it, and it was still not ready for release. In the meantime, a stopgap solution called Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA)  had  to  be  rushed  into  production, and like most things rushed into production,  it  was  also  late.  Commodore  management  made  things  even worse by canceling Dave Haynie's A3000+ with AGA project in early 1991 in favor of the A4000, which ended up being an inferior design. Unfortunately, AGA was missing a key feature that was starting to turn the once-lowly PC into a gaming powerhouse.

## The coming DOOM

The PC became a gaming contender with the release of a new three-letter graphics standard: VGA. VGA didn't have any fancy acceleration, but it did have a standard mode  called 13h, which delivered 320x200 resolution in 256 colors.

The ECS Amiga chipset could theoretically  display  4,096  colors  simultaneously in  HAM mode, but this mode was too slow for action games. Amiga games  typically  used  320x200  resolution in 32 colors instead.

The AGA chipset 'fixed' this issue by increasing the memory size and allowing 256 color modes, so in theory it could  have  competed  with  VGA.  But VGA  was  available  in  1987  with  the IBM PS/2 computers and had become widespread in clones by 1990, whereas  AGA  wasn't  available  until  1992. AGA also had a problem that was starting to become an issue with games: it addressed each of its pixels using planar, rather than chunky, color modes.

Planar access divides up color bits among several  'planes'-think  layers in  Photoshop-that  can  be  accessed separately. In the days before 256 colors, this saved huge amounts of video RAM, which was at a premium. When combined with chips like the blitter, it also made it really easy to create sidescrolling  arcade  games  with  multiple 'parallax'  layers  that  moved  smoothly at  different  speeds.  The  PC  architecture, even with the new VGA cards, had a difficult time doing this.

But a little shareware game came out  in  1993  that  made  every  single side-scrolling arcade game seem obsolete  overnight.  It  was  DOOM,  and  it used  all  256  colors  in  VGA's  chunky modes (including  a  new  undocumented 320x240x256 mode) to create a simulation of a 3D world. It wasn't full 3D, of course, but it was a quantum leap for gamers. Games like DOOM used powerful  386 and 486 CPUs to make up for the lack of graphical acceleration. The Amiga, for so long the gold standard of gaming, needed a DOOM, but it couldn't have it. It didn't have the right graphics hardware. The fix (adding chunky modes to the chipset) wasn't difficult, but it wasn't available. Instead, it was shoehorned into a new Hail-Mary product that was intended to save the company and almost did.

## The CD32

The CD was invented as a digital audio storage format in 1982 in a collaboration  between  electronics  giants Philips  and  Sony.  It  took  the  music world by storm, and in 1984 Sony and Denon demonstrated the first CD-ROM, which  gave  a  personal  computer  a read-only storage capacity of 540 megabytes.  As  most  games  were  distributed  on  floppy  disks  of  a  single megabyte at the time, this was a ludicrous  amount  of  storage,  and  companies  struggled  to  come  up  with  ideas for new types of content and hardware to play it on.

Philips, after many  delays, released its CDi device, which looked like a  regular  CD  player  but  cost  $700.  It was a huge commercial failure, remembered  today  only  for  an  improbably terrible series of Zelda games.

Commodore had also decided  to get on this bandwagon, and it had actually beat Philips to the punch when it released the CDTV in 1991. It was essentially an Amiga 500 with a CD-ROM drive in a similar plain rectangular box. These devices were met with confusion by  the  general  public-they  weren't computers,  because  they  had  no  keyboards,  but  they  weren't  game  consoles  either  (although  the  CDTV  did play  a  mean  game  of  Lemmings),  because  they  were  sold  without  game controllers  and  were  priced  prohibitively  high  for  that  market.  The  CDTV also failed, but it set the stage for Commodore's final product, the CD32.

This device would be a game console,  pure  and  simple.  Commodore attempted  to  one-up  Sega  (who  had struggled with the Sega CD add-on to the underpowered Genesis) by designing the console to look very similar to a Genesis,  but  with  '32-BIT'  replacing that  system's  '16-BIT'  designation  in proud white letters. Inside was essentially  an  Amiga  1200  with  a  CD-ROM

drive  and  a  new  chip  called  'Akiko' that  added  MPEG  2  movie  playback and chunky-to-planar graphics conversion.

It  still  wasn't  quite  enough  for DOOM, however. The CD32 had a lowpower  68EC020  CPU  running  at  14 MHz with very slow memory. This was about equivalent to a 386 at the same speed, which hadn't been cutting-edge since  1990.  Some  games,  like  Wing Commander, were converted to run on the  CD32,  but  DOOM  never  made  it. Instead,  and  somewhat  ironically,  it was ported to the Jaguar game console, the  last  piece  of  hardware  that  Atari ever made.

Still, the CD32 was a very respectable game machine for its time, and it was  scheduled  to  be  released  before Christmas 1993 for $399. Unfortunately, Commodore had run out of time and money.

## Death by XOR

As Commodore approached its final  Christmas  season,  it  was  having trouble negotiating with its parts suppliers.  Years  of  being  behind  on  payments were starting to take their toll, and  Commodore  could  only  procure enough parts to make 100,000 CD32s. As Dave Haynie noted in his Deathbed Vigil  video,  they  might  have  survived with 400,000.

The CD32 was released in Europe and  in  Canada,  but  Commodore  was unable to sell it in the United States due to  a  legal  injunction  for  non-payment of patent royalties to a company called Cad Track. This was an early example of a patent troll, as the patent was for using  the  simple  Boolean  XOR  (exclusive  OR)  formula  for  displaying  computer  graphics.  XOR  is  a  fast  way  to overlap graphics non-destructively and  was  commonly  used  by  GUIs  to draw bounding boxes. Every other computer company simply paid Cad Track their  royalties  as  a  matter  of  course, but Commodore had defaulted on payments and had refused to pay the $10 million penalty ordered by a US judge. At this time Mehdi Ali was still taking home more than $2 million a year.

The CD32 sold all 100,000 units in Europe  and  Canada,  but  Commodore had no money to make any more. The market for the consoles collapsed after Commodore's liquidation, but some of them found some innovative uses: for example, a company in Vancouver created  the  first  online  banking  application for Vancity using CD32s  and custom-built add-on modems.

## A different approach

In retrospect, taking on Sega and Nintendo  was  probably  not  the  best approach for a company that was struggling to sell in the much smaller market for personal computers. Commodore's UK division made headlines by taking out a billboard next to Sega's headquarters  that  said,  'To  get  this  good  will take Sega ages,' but this sort of boasting  would  have  been  moot  just  a  few years later when Sony introduced the PlayStation and drove Sega out of hardware forever.

The Amiga started as a game console and would have died in the 1983 video  game  crash  if  it  hadn't  been quickly  converted  to  a  personal  computer. A decade later,  Commodore tried  to  save  its  company  by  turning the  Amiga  back  into  a  game  console, but it was too little and too late.

What if, instead of chasing the volatile  video  game  market,  Commodore had  simply  bundled  a  CD-ROM  drive with  the  Amiga  1200  instead?  In  the early '90s, so-called 'multimedia' PCs were starting to become a big market, but they were expensive and fiddly and stuck in a chasm between the unfriendly,  single-tasking  DOS  and  the  rickety paint job of Windows 3.1.

An Amiga 1200 with a built-in CDROM drive would have been a perfect entry  into  this  market.  With  a  slight bump in CPU speeds and a better Akiko chip, it could have easily played DOOM, Myst,  Wing  Commander,  and  all  the other great games of the day. It would have  been  cheaper,  more  powerful, and easier to use than multimedia PCs that struggled to display video that was larger  than  a  postage  stamp.  It  could have been sold to students as an entrylevel  computer,  with  more  powerful units available as their needs increased. Those  machines,  powered  by  68040 and 68060 chips and the AAA chipset, would  have  easily  kept  up  with  highend PCs.

It's worth noting that Commodore engineers were, at the time of the company's demise, working on even more advanced Amiga architectures.  The

Hombre project planned to use an HP PA RISC processor and a 3D graphics accelerator card to deliver a truly nextgeneration Amiga. It, too, was starved of  development  resources  and  never released.

Another machine that  Commodore should have made but never did was  an  Amiga  laptop.  It  would  have been  difficult  to  re-engineer  the  Amiga's powerful custom chips so that they wouldn't suck up battery life, but not impossible. Commodore simply didn't have the resources available for such a product and foolishly thought that the market for laptops was not large enough to be worth pursuing.

## The blame lies at the top

Commodore had many failings as a company. Steve Jobs had once offered to sell the early Apple to Commodore, but when the company rejected him, he dismissed their management as being 'sleazy.'  Jobs  was  prone  to  hyperbole, but he wasn't entirely inaccurate. Jack Tramiel's hard-nosed management style often offended both suppliers and resellers, but he at least had a vision for what the company was supposed to be. When he was removed, the new management  kept  his  offensive  style  but lost any and all strategic outlook.

At the end of the day, Irving Gould was  the  one  who  kicked  out  Tramiel. This created not just a power vacuum but an instant rival. Jack swore revenge, took  over  Atari,  and  released  the  ST, which very nearly killed the Amiga before it had a chance to take off.

Gould  also  hired  and  promoted Mehdi  Ali,  who  bled  Commodore  dry while lining his own pockets. Mehdi Ali would  end  up  hiring  people  like  Bill Sydnes, who had been the product man- ager  for  IBM's  PC  Junior  (the  biggest failure in that company's history) and was responsible for canceling the innovative  Amiga  A3000+.  In  the  end  of Dave  Haynie's  Deathbed  Vigil  video, the Commodore engineers spent their last night painting the names of these managers on the speed bumps in the company parking lot, then burnt a doll of Mehdi Ali in effigy. It was a fate far kinder than these people deserved.

After  Commodore  liquidated,  Ali formed an extremely sketchy management  consulting  company  that  vanished  from  the  Web  a  few  years  ago. Consulting the Internet Archive shows that Mehdi described himself as having 'accomplished a major operational turnaround'  during  his  time  serving  as president  of  Commodore.  That  could be  considered  true,  in  a  sense.  He joined  Commodore when it was a billion dollar  company  and  turned  it around until it was a bankrupt one.

## What we can learn from Commodore's demise

One of the best things that Mark Twain never actually said was: 'History never repeats itself, but it does rhyme.' The  stories  of  Commodore  and  Apple had many similarities. Both had mercurial, stubborn founders. Both had early successes  with  8-bit  computers  (the Commodore 64 and Apple ][) thanks to underrated technical geniuses (Chuck Peddle and Steve Wozniak), and both later  sold  16  and  32-bit  computers with  fancy  GUIs  (the  Amiga  and  the Macintosh). Both kicked out their founders, who went on to produce rival products that failed in the marketplace (Atari ST and NeXT).

But Commodore faltered and disappeared,  whereas  Apple  got  Jobs  to

return, and he led the company to become the most valuable on the planet.

Maybe Jack Tramiel was no Steve Jobs.  He  was  older  and  more  single minded. He never really  saw  past  his idea of selling computers 'to the masses, not the classes.' The Atari ST was a decent enough computer, but it ended up being a footnote in history, a cheap and poor imitation  of  the  Amiga.  The NeXT, on the other hand, contained forward-looking  technology  that  ended up powering both OS X and iOS.

Apple also didn't have to contend with executives who seemed hell-bent on wringing every last dollar of profit from  the  company  and  putting  it  in their  own  pockets.  If  you  look  at  the financial  history  of  Commodore,  they always  seemed  to  hover  around  zero profits:  sometimes a bit higher, sometimes a bit lower. A more recent company that also uses that strategy is Amazon, but Jeff Bezos funnels all the money that would end up as profit into growing the company, instead of engineering financial scams that benefit only the top execs.

In the end, Commodore imploded, and it was a sad thing. But the Amiga itself,  although  it  would  never  challenge  for  market  share  again,  would survive the death of its parent company. It was a dream given form: a personal computer that was fast and friendly and responsive, that multitasked well, that  played  great  games,  and  that  behaved in a way that made its owners not  just  fans  but  fanatics.  Today,  it  is neither gone nor forgotten.
