## Music in Video Games

Welcome to what is more or less the end of the summer season. Our thoughts and well-wishes go out to those in coastal Texas, Florida, and elsewhere, as they work to recover from the battering taken during this year's record-setting hurricane season. It's events like this that put our own piddling petty problems in perspective.

On that terrible segue, I'll give the next installment of Vampire-Quest. There haven't been any direct updates on my ordered Vampire 600 board, but Kipper, who has been my contact since I first expressed interest in early 2016, is leaving the Apollo accelerators group, ostensibly overwhelmed by the workload and related financial issues.  This  leaves  the  exact  status  of  my  paid  order unknown, with the person I have dealt with up to now turning duties over to… who exactly?, while the Apollo group themselves work to transition to the upcoming Vampire V4 board family. There's a mind-boggling level of  uncertainty  at  work  here,  which  hopefully  will  be remedied soonish, or at least before the next generation of boards make it all entirely pointless.

I'm going outside my Amiga-based articles for a bit for a topic I found interesting lately. I often find the history of video games worthy of study, and recently I turned to the subject of music in games. (beware: several video links will follow). In terms of copyrights and intellectual properties,  the  fledgling  video  game  industry  of  the 1970s and early 1980s was pretty much the wild west, as legal precedents catch up with new media. Even the very  first  arcade  video  games,  'Computer  Space'  and 'Pong' are modified copies of the 'Spacewar!' game for university computers and Ralph Baer's TV Tennis that would  become  the  first  Magnavox  Odyssey.  Concept copying and even direct bootlegging of arcade games was common through the seventies. I probably couldn't count the number of bootlegs, copies, and shallow variations there are of the first 'mega-hit' video game, 'Space Invaders.'

While  I  could  probably  go  on  and  on,  I  found  myself concentrating on the subject of music in the early days of Video games. At the start, most video games had little more than simple sound effects. If there was any music,

Dallas it was a simple tune to signify a game event, and usually a crude clipped digital rendition of a well known tune, like the funeral march played when an on-screen character dies in games like 'Gun Fight' or 'Circus.' The role of    music  in  games grew steadily, from the 'Jaws'-like two notes of 'Asteroids' to the opening ditties of 'PacMan'  to  the  simple,  repetitive  background  tunes  of 'Donkey Kong.' One of the first arcade games to have a moderately  elaborate  musical  soundtrack  was  'Frogger,' a game about a car-sized frog crossing a road and a  river,  by  Konami  and  distributed  in  the  US  by  Sega. The  game  had  multiple  long  (longer  than  one  or  two bars anyway) tunes, which played throughout, but few, if  any, were original compositions. The tune played at the  start,  which  most  people  familiar  with  Frogger know,  comes  from  a  1960s  Japanese  children's  song, "Inu no Omawarisan" (or 'The Dog Policeman')

Frogger start:

That's far from the only musical borrowing. In addition to 'quotes' from 'Camptown Races' and other sources, the primary tune that plays during the main game action  comes  from  a  1970s  Japanese  animated  series called  'Rascal  the  Raccoon.'  (Fun  fact:  this  cartoon prompted many Japanese to import  raccoons  as  pets back  then,  which  later  became  a  destructive  invasive species in the country.)

Much of the western audience probably never realized the soundtrack wasn't original, as they weren't familiar with the Japanese source material. Most home ports for consoles  and  computers  repeated  the  same  music  as best  they  could.  The  musical  copying  was  apparently too blatant for Konami to get away with, at least in the long term, as recent ports replace the classic 'Frogger' music with new original compositions, or drop the music completely.

Exploring  the  topic  of  appropriated  music  further,  I continued with early arcade games by Konami, as the company  seemed  to  pioneer  in  the  strong  musical soundtrack,  and  the  borrowing  of  tunes  to  do  so.  My next example was 'Amidar,' a game described as a cross between Pac-Man and Qix, by way of a Japanese puzzle. I  discovered  the  jaunty  jungle-ish  tune  played  on  the first  level  is  shared  with  a  1960s  Japanese  cartoon called 'Adventure on Gaboten Island.'

Another Konami game, 'Pooyan' (in which a mother pig conducts  a  siege  defense  against  wolves),  had  an  ingame  tune  I  found  quite  catchy,  which  I  have  since found to be the curiously named 'Desecration Rag' by Felix Arndt. I would discover ragtime music to be popular among game soundtracks.

Konami redeems itself somewhat with shooter 'Gyruss' (basically Galaga in a circle), widely lauded as having possibly the best musical soundtrack of the early  'eighties arcade. It still borrows tunes, namely 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' by Bach, reworked into an up-tempo rock version, which requires some musical (re)composition talent. I've heard it compared to 'Tocatta' by instrumental band Sky, but to me it's mainly just because both are rock versions of the same classical song.

## Gyruss:

So you won't think I'm picking on Konami exclusively, I can  cite  examples  from  other  producers.  'Bagman' from  Valadon  Automation  (all  about  stealing  money) makes  liberal  use  of  the  classic  tune  'Turkey  in  the Straw.'

'Domino Man' (pretty self-explanatory, really) from Bally-Midway continues the  ragtime  tradition  with  Scott Joplin's 'Maple Leaf Rag'

The game 'Pengo' (about a penguin murdering arctic wildlife by crushing them with ice blocks) has two versions. The first used the 1969 synth-pop instrumental tune 'Popcorn,' which was replaced by an original tune for  the  second  version.  Presumably  the  change  was made to avoid legal issues in one sense or another.

Perhaps one of the more blatant arcade musical appropriations comes from fledgling company Japanese game maker SNK and its multi-stage shooter 'Vanguard' (possibly better known for its ports to Atari consoles than arcades). It opens with the theme from the first 'Star Trek'  movie,  and  tacks  on  a  'power  up'  music  from Queen's 'Flash Gordon' soundtrack, though just short clips of each.

Why is music theft so apparently common in the early days of video games? I can't say for certain, but I can make a number of easy assumptions. First, many of the games of the early eighties, both home and arcade, were designed  by  very  small  teams  or  even  one  individual, usually  a  programmer  or  a  hardware  designer,  and there probably weren't a lot of talented music composers on staff at video game companies back then, so it was  probably  much  simpler  to  transcribe  a  familiar tune,  whether  popular  music  or  public  domain,  into digital notes, Second, copyright law was playing catching up to the then-new media of video games, and many games came from Japan and other countries, which held varying levels of respect for intellectual property. Perhaps it was believed a clip of a copyrighted tune in a game  was  not  worth  pursuing  legally,  or  translating that tune into the beeps and boops of the early audio hardware made it a different enough entity in a copyright sense. Who can say exactly, but most game producers are far more careful about creating original content today, even if it is derivative original content. I concentrated on arcade video games in this article, though I'm sure home games had similar issues perhaps to a greater  degree.  Many  home  versions  of  arcade  games  will port the borrowed music along to the new platform.

I  will  leave  you  with  one  home  computer  game  I've always loved, even though its music usage falls in the 'so audaciously  blatant  it's  awesome  category-'Frantic Freddie,' a simple Commodore 64 game by Commercial

Data  Systems,  later  ported  to  the  Amiga  by  Bignonia. Music  appearing  in  this  game  includes  'Crazy  Little Thing  Called  Love'  by  Queen,  'Boogie  Fever'  by  the Sylvers,  'A  Fifth  of  Beetoven'  from  Walter  Murphy, 'Don't  Bring  Me  Down'  by  ELO,  Paul  Simon's  'Kodachrome,'  and  no  less  than  five  ragtime  tunes  from Scott Joplin. Enjoy, everyone!

Amiga Love has had a few articles on getting various Commodore  machines  back  online  and  into  the  BBS world. From C64s to Amiga 500s (et al) as well as the terminal  programs  we  use;  PETSCII  capable  (i,  ii)  in case you're trying to hit an C64 BBS from your Amiga or ANSI  capable,  like  A-Talk  III,  for  most  other  boards. There are a lot of options out there, and the BBS scene is vastly smaller than back in the day, but it's not dead by any stretch. Oh no, dear reader, it is not dead. (I see four  lights!)  If  anything,  the  interest  in  this  form  of socializing and connecting seems to be growing lately as  hardware  options  become  easier  to  build  and  less expensive to source.

Tonight, I finally got my Amiga 1000 online for the first time ever and connected to some of my favorite BBSs. And oh my god, have you ever seen a more beautiful sight? I doubt it. Well, at least not for about 30 years, give or take.

Here's what I used to accomplish this pièce de résistance.

![Image](2017-10-NL_artifacts/image_000002_65365ec3e7b03c6dfb5a755830acbd93e300c742f62d5fcf25637276fecd8ff8.png)

- Amiga 1000 with 1MB of total chip &amp; fast RAM. It could probably be done with less, but guaranteed no issues.
- Paul Rickards wifi modem with 1MB of total chip &amp; fast  RAM.  It  could  probably  be  done  with  far  less (maybe .5MB), but this guaranteed no issues. Also required  the  use  of  a  serial  port  gender  changer, due to the Amiga 1000's port.
- Kickstart 1.3 disk (it's an Amiga 1000 after all)
- 64Door  terminal  program  to  connect  to  Particles BBS  and  Centronian  BBS  (there  are  lots  of  other active C64 boards, too), both PETSCII capable board that  are  run  off  actual  C64s.  You  can  connect  to them in ANSI but it's not as pretty.
- A-Talk  III  simply  my  favorite  ANSI  terminal  program, for hitting  non-C64 boards. It requires that you load Workbench (1.3 in my case) to run from there. Or a hard drive. I ain't got no hard drive on my 1000. Old school, yo!

That's it!

And since I already had everything in the list except for the gender changer, once I got it today in the mail it took me all of one minute to hook everything up and get to BBSing.
