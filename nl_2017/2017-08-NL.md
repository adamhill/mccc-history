## Vampires, Tablets &amp; 40 Years of Computing Part 2

It's  summer,  which  around  here means  heat,  and  just  about  everything else besides. After all my negative  ranting  over  misfortunes  last month,  I  feel  things  have  turned  a corner in one sense or another. My new Samsung tablet, which cracked its screen less than a week after purchase, is now repaired and returned, and most fortunately covered under warrantee,  so  it  would  seem  the choices I constantly second-guessed turned out to be the right ones. After months of waiting and prodding, my quest for the Vampire 600 board has  move  forward  one  more  step, and I finally have my board paid for, and with luck shipping without several more months of waiting. Though given past history an experience,  I'm  considering  allowing  the time to get my Amiga 600's capacitors  replaced,  on  the  assumption the  interval  between  now  and  the point I  get  the  board  might  just  allow it.

It has been interesting watching the continuing development of the 'Apollo core' which makes the Vampire-series cards so desirable. What started  as  a  processor  accelerator faster than any 68060 added more features, such as a video card equivalent  outputting  to  HDMI  and  progressing with an implementation of the  AGA  chipset  (making  possible the use of AGA software and games on  non-AGA  systems,  and  output-

ting  Amiga screens and audio thru HDMI).  There  is  demand  for  floating-point-math unit implementation,  and  so  far  a  'softFPU'  is  in testing,  which  appears  suitable  for lower-demand  work  until  a  more direct implementation is added (if it is). An AROS-based 'kickstart' ROM geared  toward  use  with  Vampire boards is in work too, bypassing the need  to  work  around  the  limits  of over twenty-year-old kickstarts. All this is in service of building a standalone Vampire-based system, which is  essentially  a  new-and-improved Amiga system, mostly compatible at a hardware level, more or less fulfilling  the  promises  of  the  Natami  development  team  back  in  the  day. Exactly what the demand would be for such a setup, especially outside of  current  and  former  Amiga  owners, is unknown, but I'll keep an eye on  developments.  Hopefully  I'll  be using my Vampire 600 at the time.

Finally, I recently picked up a new Raspberry Pi 3 board , swapping out the Pi 2 I had before, and revamping my  multi-emulation  system  in  the process. I'll be sure to bring it along to the meeting, to show off the differences.

Last month, I started running through  my  four  decades  of  past experiences  in  computers  and  consoles, from 1977 and the Atari VCS to my first Amiga systems as I went off to college. I did miss one notable thing though. Around 1985 or 1986 I got my third system after the Atari and  the  Commodore  64-the  Nintendo  Entertainment  System.  The lure  of  Super  Mario  was  too  great back  in  the  day,  along  with  the

promise of 80s-grade arcade quality at home. The NES was my first piece of  major  electronics  I  bought  with my own money, getting one through layaway  at  the  now-defunct  Hills discount store. I got a lot of use out of  that  gray  box,  at  least  until  the Amiga  started shifting  my  focus years later.

Catching up, I went to art college in Columbus as the 1990s got moving. I spent my first year in the dorms, so I  was  unable  to  bring  my  Amiga with me (probably for the best, as my  room  was  robbed  once,  and  I lost a typewriter), but I frequented the school's computer graphics lab, which had several Amiga 1000s and a few 2000s. (apparently the Columbus College of Art and Design had a lot  of  confidence  in  the  Amiga  during  its  early  days).  I  brought  my own software  and  managed  to  get work done in the lab, even producing an animation from start to finish over  a  number  of  hours  one  day. The next year I moved into my own apartment, and my Amiga 2000 followed.  The  system  got  a  work  out then, as I could work alone, calling online  bulletin  boards  in  Dayton over long distance, at the height on my  Amiga-related  celebrity.  I  was approached  by  Electronic  Arts  to beta-test  what  would  become  the AGA version of Deluxe Paint  4 (though  AGA  hardware  was  unreleased at the time), and Gold Disk to produce animation clips for a new product of theirs, Both of which lead me to my next computer systems.

I'll  take  a  break  here  to  talk  about my  next  game  machine.  I  always had  an  interest  in  Atari's  counter- part  to  the  NES,  the  7800,  which played 2600 games in addition to its own, ever since it was previewed in magazines back in 1984, but not released  widely  until  after  Nintendo dominated  the  market.  In  the  90s the Atari systems were sold at clearance  at  Odd  Lots  (now  Big  Lots) stores,  but  I  was  unable  to  secure one, though I did get a 2600 'Jr.' and lots of game carts for 1 to 3 bucks each.  I  later  bought  a  7800  off  a friend, and spent much time playing Atari  games  in  my  college  apartment,  reveling  in nostalgia.  This seems to have kicked off my recurring tendency to buy 'finished' game systems  as  they  sell  out  stock  for cheap. I also got my first Apple Macintosh,  the  68020-based  Mac  LC (for  'low-cost  color')  pizza-box,  a loaner machine so I could produce example works for Gold Disk's new mac animation software and screen saver  packages.  Using  the  Mac  for extended periods gave me an appreciation for the differences between the Amiga and Mac systems, even if the Mac was a bit sleeker and higher-spec than my A2000.

That  balance  was  redressed  somewhat  with  my  next  jump  forward, the Amiga 1200 with its 68020 CPU and AGA video chipset. I remember shopping around at a Computerfest for  an  80  megabyte  hard  drive  to put inside it, splurging on a 120 meg drive instead, believing it to be tremendous  overkill  at  the  time.  The move to 256 color and near-24-bit HAM  modes  was  quite  the  leap, even if I already had some of that on the  Mac.  The  newer,  faster  Amiga systems forced me to reevaluate the way  the  way  I  created  my  animations, even if they were not specifically geared to fast AGA machines. I noticed  my  old  animations  often played unwatchably fast on the faster systems, as back in my Amiga 500 days,  I  would  set  the  animation  to run as fast as possible, the hardware itself being the brakes. I learned to set a particular playback speed, that won't  be  exceeded  when  the  hardware  is  fast  enough  to  allow  it.    I continued to apply my Amiga skills to my  graphics classes,  perhaps cheating  a  bit  by  applying  newer and  better  hardware  to  my  work than others had access to in the Amiga-using class.

1994  was  my  last  year  of  college, but unfortunately also the last year of the Commodore company, which put a lot of uncertainty into my Amiga  interest.  Still,  I  was  riding  my Amiga systems to new heights, even as I returned the loaner Mac. After graduation, I produced larger, more ambitious  animation  projects,  put more  effort  into  the  AFIT/AmigaDayton/AmiTech  user  groups  and their appearances at the yearly Computerfest shows, and produced a collection of my animations with Fred Fish for the then-fresh-and-popular CD-ROM format. The CD was quite successful, and I made a lot of money off it back  then,  which  was poured  into  a  (relatively)  brandnew  Amiga  4000  tower,  from  the returned  Escom  Amiga  Technologies. The 4000T would be my most

powerful official Amiga system, growing with 68060 and PowerPC CPUs, video and sound cards, bigger drives, I/O and USB over the years, My  collector  mentality  asserted  itself a bit, and I tried to acquire examples  of  the  Amiga  systems  I  didn't own,  including  the  original  Amiga 1000, the A600 (the same one I plan to add a Vampire board to), and the CD-32 game console. I think the only  system  I  never  got  (discounting variants  like  the  A1500  or  A500 plus)  was  the  CDTV  multimedia player  (and  I  still  wouldn't  mind having  one).  Things  would  change once  again  in  1996,  as  I  learned more  about  the  wider  world  and saw a demonstration of the Mosaic web browser. I found I couldn't resist the temptation any longer, and signed  up  for  dial-up  Internet  service for the first time.
