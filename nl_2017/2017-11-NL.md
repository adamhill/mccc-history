## Game Ports

With the theme of October, fall, and Halloween, I wish I could say there were new developments in my continuing  'Vampire  Quest'  saga,  but there is no new news in newstown. I'm just waiting around to find out if  future  Vampire  stand-along  system developments completely moot-out any reasons for having a version  attached  to  classic  hardware or not at this point.

In other news, our member-atlarge  Jim  Lawrence  sent  me  this link ( https:// thec64.com ) for the C64  Mini,  a  small  replica  of  the 'bread box' Commodore 64 system to  be  released  in  2018,  which  can hook up to a TV via HDMI, use USB game  controllers  and  keyboards, and comes with dozens of pre-loaded  games  for  a  price  somewhere around $70. It might seem a bit pricey for something akin to Nintendo's recent short-stocked retro systems, but if it is a fully usable C64 computer  as  opposed  to  a  simple  game jukebox (which is strongly implied by  the  website),  or  even  a  small Linux-capable system (which is something I thought I saw at some point, but I'm not finding any confirmation right now), it might just be worth it. Now how do I plug in my decades-old  cartridges  and  floppy discs?

As you may have noticed, I've written  about  various  facets  of  retro gaming  over  in  these  pages  over the last few months, as it's a subject I  find  interesting  and  have  been learning more and more about over

time. This time I feel like going over the subject of game 'ports.' Most in computer circles are already aware, but in software terms a port is the conversion of a program, such as a game, to a different hardware platform  or  operating  system,  which can  involve  anything  from  minuscule modifications of existing code and data to a complete recreation from the ground up.

Truth be told, the dawn of commercial video gaming is built on ports. The first arcade games, 'Computer Space' and 'Pong' were ostensibly ports of 'Spacewar!' (for a version that  didn't  require  a  50  thousand dollar university computer system and added a 1 player version) and the  'Brown  Box'  by  Ralph  Baer which would become the first Odyssey  (enhancing  the  gameplay  and adding score-keeping).

Of course, these first examples are only  'ports'  in  a  debatable  sense, as they are more about creating a new game based on the idea, style, or genre of the previous work, making 'their version,' as it were. This happened  frequently  in  the  'wild west'  days  of  early  video  games, with different game publishers making their own variations or blatant  copies  of  popular  games,  and still  happens  as  recently  as  today. Just look at mobile game stores for the  number  of  clones  of  the  wellknown, or ask someone what games were ripped off by more popular franchises like Worms, Angry Birds,  Candy  Crush,  or  any  other thing by King games.

It  would  seem  the  concept  of  professional porting of games started with  Atari,  converting  their  early games  like  Pong  and  others  into forms capable of being played through a home television, though those mid-seventies creations were  as  much  or  more  hardware design as anything.

Game porting  really  took  off  with the advent of the Atari VCS as well as  other  game  consoles,  and  their software on cartridges. Atari wasted  no  time  putting  out  home  versions  of  their  own  arcade  games, not to mention unauthorized home copies  of  other  manufacturers'  arcade games, though not necessarily with  the  same  names.  Atari's  first official, properly licensed  home port of another's arcade game  (possibly  the  first  by  anyone)  was  the 1980 home release of the 1978 paradigm-shifting arcade hit 'Space Invaders.'  Atari  could  conceivably make a Space-Invaders-alike game under  a  different  title,  like  nearly every other console available at the time,  but  they  made  the  effort  of getting  the  rights  from  Japanese company Taito,  so  they  could  sell the  'real  game'  under  the  real name (though some say it was also partially to stick it to Bally Midway, for their huge success as US manufacturer of the arcade Invaders machines), an approach which paid off, as  the  game  became  one  of  history's  first  'killer  apps,'  catapulting Atari  VCS  sales  to  their  highest point.

Taking the hint, Atari and later the third party games companies snapped up as many arcade licenses  for  home  ports  as  they  could. Atari put out many, between licenses  and  their  own  IP,  from  'Asteroids'  and  'Missile  Command'  to 'Defender' and 'Berzerk' and many more, one of the most famous (and infamous) being Atari's home port of Namco's 'Pac-Man.'

Porting  a  game  to  a  new  system, such  as  arcade  to  home  console, carried a set of challenges, especially  in  the  early  days.  First  off,  the average arcade machine was usually many times more advanced and costly than the  general-purpose home console, and the game might easily be beyond  their capacity. The  1977  Atari  2600  VCS  was  designed  around  being  able  to  play most of the same games as the single-purpose 'Pong consoles' prior. The 1983 Nintendo Famicom, which  would  become  the  NES  in America, was built around playing 'a really good game of Donkey Kong' (not  Super  Mario…Donkey  Kong). Both machines extended their operational lives and played games supposedly  'beyond'  them  through clever programming and hardware enhancements to the software cartridges.

Secondly, in the early days, the only resources devoted to a game port were  one  or  more  programmers with  access  to  an  arcade  machine. Access  to  source  code,  developer documents,  or  graphics  data  was hardly a given, and with the differences in hardware between various arcade machines or game consoles or home computers, might not be of much  use  anyway,  which  leave those doing the porting to essentially  create  a  brand  new  game  that hopefully looks and plays as close to  the  source  material  as  possible. Certainly everyone has seen a game that bears little resemblance at all to  the  name  on  the  package,  or looks and sounds the part but plays differently or just badly, or the op- posite  where  the  presentation  is poor but the gameplay is on point.

Sometimes  elements  of  the  game are  modified  to  either  play  to  the strengths  or  minimize  the  weaknesses of the hardware it's ported to.  (For  an  offbeat  example,  the Atari  game 'Adventure' was created as a visual version of a computer text  adventure,  for  a  system  not made to display  a  screen  of  text.) Other times it's  even  enhanced, adding value in one way or another, or just adjusting the play to be less punishing  and  more  fun  than  an arcade  game  with  the  purpose  of squeezing as many quarters as possible out of players.

Going back to two previously-mentioned arcade ports, Atari's 'Space Invaders,' which launched Atari to new heights, and 'Pac-Man,' which punctuated  their decline. I  was wondering exactly what makes 'Pac-Man' a 'bad port' and 'Space Invaders' a good one. Anyone will point out that Atari 'Pac-Man' falls far short of the arcade version visually, not matching the original's colors or sounds or maze layout. However,  if  you  look  at  the  Atari and  arcade  versions  of  'Space  invaders' side-by-side, you could make a similar argument. Nothing on it looks exactly the same as the arcade either, and it doesn't really look any closer than the 'Space Invader' clone games on Intellivision or Odyssey2 or Astrocade as far as I  can  tell.  For  example,  an  arcade Invaders  wave  contains  55  invaders  of  three  designs  in  an  11  x  5 layout.  Atari  Invaders  does  36  on screen,  6  x  6,  with  six    different alien  designs,  none  of  which  look the  same  as  the  arcade  aliens.  In later  years,  fans  have  hacked  the Atari  game  to  make  it  a  closer graphical match to the arcade (simply tweaking the graphic data and colors and leaving the rest  unchanged), which makes me wonder why Atari made up their own origi- nal alien graphics instead of trying to  copy  the  arcade  visuals.  (Even the  versions  for  Atari's  5200  and 8-bit home computers did a similar thing, even adding a rocket on the edge of the screen for the aliens to march out of). You can bitch about Atari 'Pac-Man' and his ghosts being  pale  and  flickery,  but  at  least they appear to be the right general shape.  Perhaps  there's  something less  tangible  in  play  here,  where despite  the  differences  from  their respective sources, Atari 'Space Invaders'  captures  the  spirit  of  the arcade  gameplay  while  Atari  'PacMan'  does  not.  In  truth  however, Atari's 'Pac-Man' was a documented rush-job done to get the game to market  as  fast  as  possible.  It  also sold well, but not well enough for the  overblown  production  run,  resulting  in  financial  losses.  It  was shown that a 'Pac-Man'  game could be done competently within the Atari VCS hardware limits later on, with ports of 'Ms. Pac-Man' and 'Jr.  Pac-Man,' and several different home-brew  remakes  of  the  first Pac-Man  (one  of  which  was  used for the 2017 Atari Flashback Portable  system  instead  of  Atari's  own. Apparently Namco  thought that would be better).

Official  arcade  game  ports  continued on the Atari 2600 as far along as 1990, when it was sold against Nintendo's  NES  as  a  'budget  system.' These included arcade games that  should  be  well  beyond  the power  of  the  humble  1977  hardware,  such  as  'Kung-Fu  Master,' 'Double  Dragon,'  and  'Rampage.' And to be honest they were, but it is testament  to  the  resourceful  programmers that they came anywhere near as close as they did.

I'll finish this off bringing it around to  the  venerable Amiga. Being the gaming  powerhouse  it  was  at  its height, game ports were a big fact of  life  for  the  system,  both  to  and from. In its earlier days, the Atari ST

took  an  early  hold  on  the  market, especially  in  European  countries, and the basic similarities between ST and Amiga meant many games were written for the ST first, then converted for the Amiga with little to  no  enhancements  for  the  Amiga's  audiovisual  advantages.  With the rise of the Amiga 500 flipping the  balance  of  the  market,  the  reverse  became  true.  The  Amiga  became the 'gold standard' of games before  and  since  had  its  (heavy) share of home ports of arcade machines,  which  ran  the  gamut  from faithful to unrecognizably bad. Sadly,  the  Amiga  probably  had  an  unfair share of poor arcade ports, as too many were handled by the software companies as cheap cash-ins on known names. (Thankfully Amiga originals closed any quality gaps left by poor ports.)

for a time, being the machine where many games  got  their start,  and  were then  ported  and 'converted  down' to other systems like the ST,  PC, and even 8-bit computers and game consoles.

Later still, as the modular DOS/Windows PCs got more brute force in their CPUs, video, and  sound  hard- nate  enough  to  be  provided  data from the arcade game itself, so the Amiga version looks extremely faithful to the arcade visuals, with only a slight hit to the color palette. After  playing  the  original  arcade game  through  MAME,  I  can  state that the Amiga version plays more smoothly  and  consistently  in  my opinion,  with  better  music.  The game  'logic'  changes  makes  a  bit more sense too. (In the Amiga ver-

ware, the standard shifted to them along  with  the  more  modern  and powerful  game  consoles,  leaving the poor Amiga left trying its best to  manage  a  game  like  Doom  or Quake on hardware better suited to more two-dimensional imagery.

Over  its  life,  the  Amiga  like  every other game console and computer sion, you can't grab  an  enemy and slam it onto a  piece  of  floor that isn't there, for  example,  unlike the arcade, which  is  happy to let you smash things  into  thin air.) There are things  lost  from the arcade version though, such  as  a  secret set of extra game levels  with  their own story, which the  Amiga  developers  might  not

There were plenty of exceptions to the mediocre, however, which matched or even bettered the original.  A  personal favorite of mine is 'Rodland,' a home version of an obscure cutesy 1990s platform game from  Jaleco.  (In  fact,  the  various home versions are probably better known  than  the  arcade  game  itself.)  The  developers  were  fortu-
