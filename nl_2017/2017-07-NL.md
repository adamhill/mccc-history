## Vampires, Tablets and Remembering 40 Years

Welcome  to  what  is  apparently summer.  I've  written  previously about how this has been a year of poor luck for me so far in a number of ways. One of those seems to the  way  of  tech-related  frustration. I continue to be jerked around on my quest for a Vampire card for my Amiga 600, with me sitting  around  waiting  for  news about my order that never seems to  come. At least now the Apollo Accelerators  team  will  be  selling Vampire  cards  through  the  AmigaKit web store now, so I'll probably  be  looking  to  that  route  for any  future  Vampire-related  purchases. For that matter, I might go that  route  even  sooner  if  I  can't get  any  info  from  Kipper  in  the near future.

My Linux laptop, on which I do the majority of my Internet stuffs, has been  having  keyboard  troubles lately.  It  started  out  with  the  'M' key,  which became less sensitive, requiring a good, firm press to register,  which really takes the flow out  of  typing  when  you  have  to confirm that a letter actually made it from keyboard to screen. It  got  worse,  and  attempts  to  fix the problem didn't help any, until the key was nearly useless. I decided to edit the keymap, swapping 'M' with the previously mostly un-

used Windows menu key. This did the job, but I noticed a few other keys were starting to get iffy like 'M' was at the start. Since I would run  out  of  spare  unused  keys quickly, I bought a new small USB keyboard (small so it could sit on the  laptop  without  draping  over the side) with a USB passthrough for my mouse. Things are working well so far, and we shall see how things go in the longer term.

Recently, after making some money in Columbus, I stopped by venerable  Micro  Center  and  came home with a new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 tablet to replace my aging Galaxy  Note.  The  S3  is  a  newer model,  seemingly  in  competition with  the  likes  of  the  iPad  pro. There's a lot  I  like  about  it  more than my previous tablet, and some things I don't like as much. To give an example, while the S3 comes with a pen as standard, the pen can't store on the body of the smaller, thinner tablet like my old S-pen, requiring the pen to be left separate, or placed in a space on a protective case for the tablet (which  I  planned  to  do).  The  upside  is,  without  needing  to  cram into a tiny storage alcove, the pen is allowed to be the size of an actual pen, rather than a little golf pencil  stylus  thing.  Sadly,  whether thanks to my own negligence prior to getting a protective case, or the new tablet's slight build, which feels like a waxed pamphlet in-hand, my S3 already got a hairline  crack  across  the  screen  less than a week after I bought it, and

will need to be repaired. I've tried to get in touch with Samsung service, but it's looking like this won't be  covered  under  warranty.  In hindsight,  I  guess  I  should  have gone for one of those scammy buyer protection plans from the retailer, as it could have actually worked  for  me  for  once.  Regardless, I'll get this thing fixed up one way or another. It works fine otherwise, but I don't feel right leaving a blemish like that uncorrected on an otherwise new piece  of  hardware  that  I  haven't even  really  gotten  to  explore  indepth yet (and would rather avoid doing  so  until  it  is  fixed  up.  By comparison,  my  old  tablet  has been  (in  relative  terms)  beat  to crap  with  not  one  crack  to  the screen  (but  plenty  of  nicks  and scratches  around  the  casing).  At least now the protective case for my new tablet has arrived, if a bit too late.

Inspired  by  an  article  run  in  the MCCC News. 'My first 40 years of computing' by 'DoctorClu,' I realized my own experiences in computers and video games have lasted  approximately  forty  years as well. It started in 1977 I believe (me 5 or 6 at the time) when my parent  bought  the  then-new  and bleeding-edge Atari VCS (AKA Atari  2600).  I  got  a  lot  of  enjoyment out  of  that  wood-grain  machine, and some fond memories of playing competitive games against  my  Dad.  I  loved  to  win against Dad, and would frequently pick games and difficulty settings that  put  him  at  a  disadvantage. When  you're  a  small  child,  anything that made you feel superior to your parents was magical. I continued on the 2600 train for several  years,  not  getting  the  newer machines like Intellivision, Colecovision, or Atari's 5200.

It  wasn't  until  around  1983  that my family got its first new system, and  actual  home  computer.  I  remember pushing for an Atari 400 or  800  computer,  but  we  ended up  getting  the  Commodore  64, with  no  real  regrets.  I  recall  my Dad bought the C64 at its higher introductory price, and was rather annoyed when the price dropped drastically soon after. While  I  played  tons  of  games  on the  64,  I  was  also  introduced  to deeper uses, like BASIC programming,  writing,  and  creating  my own  graphics, animations,  and games.

In the meantime, I got experience with  other  computer  systems  at school,  such  as  the  Apple  II  and TI-994A.  I  would  continue  with the C64 at home for years, though for  a  few  of  those  years  I  was  already dreaming of using another Commodore  product.  In  1985  I saw  articles in magazines  like Compute! and Commodore's own publication about a new computer called the Amiga, which appeared several  orders  of  magnitude  beyond the C-64, or even those new- fangled Apple Lisa and Macintosh machines. After seeing the screen shots  of  graphics  like  the  hi-res face  of  a  mandrill,  I  was  sold  on the  system  from  that  point,  and campaigned to get one, but Mom and  Dad  were  less  enthusiastic about an expensive, unproven computer. I would have to wait a few more years, which might have been  for  the  best,  as  it  gave  the Amiga platform time to mature beyond its slightly awkward A-1000 phase.

I got my first Amiga, an A-500, for Christmas  1988. It came in a package deal with the memory expansion  bringing  it  to  a  whopping  1 megabyte, a few software packages  ,  and  a  MIDI  interface  with  a music keyboard that it -sortaworked  with  (in  that  you  could enter notes in the computer from the  keyboard,  but  not  play  back from  the  computer  to  the  keyboard). I explored games of course, but explored the world of graphics and animation software even more. Some was good, some was  limited,  some  was  powerful but ill-suited to an A500 with limited memory. Animation is notorious for using a lot of memory and storage  space,  despite  how  programs like Moviesetter made the most of scant resources.

It  was  getting  clear  that  I  would need  more  room  to  grow,  and around  1990,  I  upgraded  to  the

big box Amiga 2000, while my father inherited the A500 as a handme-down.  The  2000  started  out with  similar  specs  to  the  A500, but  was  much  easier  to  expand, and soon was granted more memory,  and  a  colossal  45  megabyte hard drive, with a Supracard interface  which  required  you  to  boot from a floppy disk, which turned control over to the hard drive.

As my Amiga system grew, so did the ambition  of  the  projects I worked on, even as I drooled over the magazine articles previewing the  new,  fast,  sleek  Amiga  3000 and its new AmigaDOS 1.4 (or 2.0). I remember one article stating the A3000 could be expanded with up to 128 megabytes of RAM, which made me believe that hard drives would be made redundant. (silly me).

I  graduated  high  school  around this time, and it wouldn't be long before I would take my computer system preferences, and later the machines  themselves,  to  college in Columbus. I'll have to cut off my tale  at  this  point,  as  it's  a  rather long one, and I'll have to spread it across at least one more month.
