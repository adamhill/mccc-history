## Greg's Updates

ACA1221 Accelerator and memory upgrade board.

When you buy the ACA1221 Accelerator upgrade board for the Amiga 1200 (and other models)  from Amigakit.com they say on the website to paraphrase:

'ACA1221  is  an  accelerator  for  the A1200 computer. It is also compatible with the ACA500 and ACA500plus. Key features are:

- ●
- processor: MC68020-16
- two clock ports
- 9  MBytes  32-bit  fast  RAM  (expandable to 63MByte)
- Maprom option
- variable clock speed.'

However  it  is  not  specific  exactly HOW to activate these features.  I wrote  Amigakit  on  December  6th and  thought  they  did  not  write back,  but  their  response  the  next day on the December 7th just got lost in the catacombs of my e-mail box.  :)

'Hi, You need to go to http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA12 21

It explains everything there.'

True, there is a lot of good information on there and links to utilities in LZH compression on how to unlock a lot of the features. However, there is  one  nugget  of  knowledge  that would be good to know for all model 1200 owners:

## February 2017

'Commodore and Escom have made all  kinds  of  mistakes  when  assembling A1200 motherboards. Internal memos from Commodore are available  that  clearly  say  to  remove  capacitors  E123C  and  E125C  for  any version of the Budgie chip, yet, you can find lots of boards out there that have these capacitors assembled. Less  often,  but  at  least  as  severe, some boards have capacitors E121C and E122C assembled. This will harm  the  quality  of  the  14MHz board clock to a degree where most accelerators (not just ours!) become unstable.'

That  information  can  be  found  at the link below.  Hey, the more you know…  ;)

## Changes  with  the  AmigaVibes Podcast

I am a huge fan of music. We used to  say  the  Atari  ST  had  the  music scene and Amiga had the graphics scene,  but  listening  to  the  AmigaVibes podcast I can see the Amiga  has  quite  a  scene,  especially  at the time I write this.

So I've done reviews of the podcast, trying to at least give you, the reader,  the  knowledge that a new podcast  was  released  and  to  check  it out, and even give pointers of which  music  I  thought  was  good and where the music starts in the program. Sadly on the track lists of the  podcasts  online  they  say  how

long  the  tracks  are  but  not  when they start. Shame!  :P

So just  know  if  you  were  subscribed to iTunes something changed after episode 49. I stopped getting new episodes when I reset my iTunes list. Today I went to the iTunes store and clicked subscribe again.  Next  to  my  previous  downloads (where episodes 20 through 49  were  visible)  was  a  new  list where all 54 episodes were listed, including a new one a few days ago called  'Amiga  Vibes  /  Amiga  Playground'  which  seems  to  be  a  special  episode  with  retro  tracks.  So far I have not found a track list online  for  the  special  episode.  So… moral  of  this  story:  go  to  iTunes and subscribe.

Also, Amiga Vibes as a Internet radio station... once again.  :D

'Radio Amiga Vibes

The radio is functional again !! A big thanks to Amitoo for his help!

Many had asked for it, in addition to our podcasts, here is now the radio Amiga Vibes. If you want to listen to it  simply click the Radio link in the menu.

The  radio  will  grow  progressively with more and more titles.

Enjoy demoscene music!'

That is all the news I have.  See you all in February (and send in your news and articles)
