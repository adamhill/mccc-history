## RetroPie

The Raspberry Pi is now able to emulates just about everything  including  the  Amiga  with  RetroPie.  The following is from the website at:

Welcome to RetroPie.

RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi or PC into a retro-gaming machine. It builds upon Raspbian, EmulationStation, RetroArch and many other projects to  enable  you  to  play  your  favourite  Arcade,  home-

Dallas console, and classic PC games with the minimum set-up. For power users it also provides a large variety of configuration tools to customise the system as you want.

RetroPie sits on top of a full OS, you can install it on an existing Raspbian, or start with the RetroPie image and  add  additional  software  later. It's up to you.

## Amiga Hopes and Desires

Being the season, I thought I would start  throwing  around  my  'Christmas List' of hopes and desires for the  coming  year.  I'm  still  waiting for the word on my Vampire II Amiga 600 expansion board, and from the looks of things, won't be expecting  it  until  sometime  next  year.  I know Majsta and Kipper have been revamping  their  production  capabilities  in  the  wake  of  heavy  demand, which hopefully goes much faster  than  the  'homebrew'  setup they  used  previously.  Considering they just opened up pre-orders (of sorts)  for  a  new  Amiga  500  Vampire version, you'd only expect demand to jump, considering how the 500  is  the  most  common  single Amiga  model  in  existence.  (and from the sound of things, it might work on the A2000 and even A1000 as well).

Some  time  back,  it  was  reported that  Jens  of  Individual  Computers bought  up  all  remaining  stock  of Amiga  custom  chipsets  (the  AGA ones at least). I always hoped that meant a modernized Amiga system board  would  be  produced,  which was-sorta right. On the Individual Computers website and wiki page, there is a project called 'Amiga Reloaded,'  which  is  a  new  Amiga main board of similar specification to an A1200. What is especially notable (and double-edged) about this board is its modular nature. All you get is the board, which is sized to  fit  in  an  Amiga  1200  casing (A500 can work too). It has 2 megs of very fast CHIP RAM, and you can add Compact Flash devices as your storage. There is no CPU on-board, and  instead  it  relies  on  any  standard A1200 CPU card. This makes some  sense  to  me,  as  1200  CPU cards are relatively easy to come by, old  and  new  (maybe  even  a  hypothetical A1200 Vampire card in the future), but other omissions seem a little less ideal in my opinion. There's  no  built-in  video  output, save for a B&amp;W composite plug (for testing and emergencies). You can pick  a  15  kHz  output  module  for

the  regular  Amiga  RGB  and  VGA plugs, or a flicker-fixer  module with VGA or HDMI outputs. Networking/ethernet and USB are extra-cost add-ons as well. I understand the intent to not have anyone pay for extra features that might go unused, but personally, I find it not that  likely  that  people  building  a 'new' Amiga system in this day and age would  pass up things like USB support and network interfaces to save a little money. Perhaps I'm out of touch, and more people are interested in bare-bones (yet new) Amiga systems than I realize.

Finally,  I'll  once  again  hope  for more Amiga goodness and recognition in the world in general. Sometimes I can almost believe we have that, at least if you browse around YouTube and gaming channels, especially where British and European presenters are involved. I hope everyone has a fine holiday, and I'll see you all at the meeting. Be there!
