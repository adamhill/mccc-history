## Commodore and Commodore UK

Welcome to tax times. I hope everyone has theirs squared away by the time  they read this. It's been a stunningly rough tax season for me. After losing my father in 2015, much of his assets which went to me qualified as 2016 income, (even if most of  it  was  stuff  I  didn't  have  direct access to) bumping my tax burden up by a factor of twelve. I'm managing, but funds are going to be tight for  a  good  while,  Wish  me  luck, 'cause I could use a little.

Since this has been my 'can't catch a  break'  year  so  far,  my  long-running  quest  for  the  Vampire  A600 accelerator  card  has  hit  a  snag  as well.  Around  the  end  of  March,  it was posted on Amiga.org and Kipper2K's  website  that  all  V600 orders  had  been  addressed,  and  I used  up  all  my  available  restraint to  not  scream curses loud enough to  explode  my house, because 'all' did  not  include  mine,  which  had been in the hopper for at least six months. Whether a clerical error or a spam filter is to blame, I can't say, but  apparently  I  missed  out,  and now I  have  to  get  in  contact  with Kipper2K,  who  is  far  worse  at  responding to email than I am (which is  saying  something),  and  pray  to all available deities  that  my  requests  don't  fall  in  the  same  bottomless pit the first one did.

I'll leave the Amiga sphere news to our  club  president,  save  for  one thing. There is a Kickstarter

backed  project  for  a  book,  which has  met  its  initial  funding  goals: 'Commodore: The Inside Story,' by David Pleasance, a name you might remember  as  the  boss  of  Commodore's UK branch. There have been several books and video documentaries on Commodore and the Amiga over the last decade or so, and most seem to cover similar ground. This  book  looks  to  offer  a  unique perspective, written by the person who ran a successful  arm  of  Commodore  despite  the  mismanagement of the home corporation. (It was successful enough to be a serious  contender  for  buying  out  the bankrupt  Commodore  in  1994.)  I imagine this promises to be an interesting read once published.

I often wonder if the decline of Commodore and Amiga was inevitable, or  if  better  decisions  and  better oversight could have kept the Amiga platform going as far as the present day. It's no secret that Commodore shot themselves in the foot  enough  times  to  eventually bleed to death, often through shortsighted decision-making and a frequently tone-deaf understanding of the systems they wanted people to buy.

It's easy to point to Commodore UK as a model of Amiga success, but it was also catering to a specific market  which  was  quite  different  to one like the USA. To give an example,  home  computers  like  the  Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and Amiga (among others) were  the  primary  home  gaming platforms in the UK for most of the

1980s and were marketed as such, while  consoles  like  the  Nintendo Entertainment  System  that  dominated the US from 1985 on had a far lesser market presence. It wasn't until Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis  and  the  Super  Nintendo came out that the home computers'  dominant  grip  on  the  UK games  market  began  to  slip.  It's hard  to  say  if  the  marketing  techniques that worked  in the  UK would have worked  in the US. While an Amiga can easily best the NES in game-playing prowess, (with the possible exception of sticking with the single-button Atari  joysticks  for  way  too  long), computers were still generally more  expensive  and  less  convenient to 'pick up and play' than the average game console, even if they were more powerful and versatile.

Still,  it's  widely  considered  a  mistake  that  Commodore  pushed  the infant Amiga as a business machine instead of a game machine, marketing  and  pricing  it  accordingly,  despite Jay Miner's original vision of a powerful  game/computer  hybrid system.  The  Amiga  only  escaped the exclusive domain of early adopters  and  hackers/tech  enthusiasts when the A500 and A2000 models were introduced, splitting the 'personal'  and  'professional'  Amiga markets  and  helping  the  Amiga flourish  in  the  gaming  market  (especially in the aforementioned UK), and bringing the Commodore Amiga to its strongest point in its history. This was thanks in part to some rather  sane  management  by  thenCEO Thomas Rattigan, who was of undoubtedly

I  suppose you could say the same about kicking out Jack Tramiel, but historical evidence strongly implies  we  probably  wouldn't  have gotten the Amiga we did, or possibly any Amiga at all, if he was directly  involved,  so  I'll  give  that  one  a pass.

ssional arena

As  previously  mentioned,  the  UK branch  of  Commodore  was  quite successful in its own market, more so  than  Commodore  as  a  whole, and their profits undoubtedly propped  up  the  global  company more than once. While it's  far  from  a  given that  what  worked  in the  UK  would  work  elsewhere, it would seem reasonable  to  me  at  least  that  the  UK branch should have been the go-to consult  for  marketing  and  related decisions, even if their advice was not used. Surely  someone  who helped  the Amiga  go  toe-to-toe with dedicated game consoles and make  the  CD32  the  top  CD  game console in its  market  (for  its  very short life) knows something.

Outside of gaming, the  Amiga's most successful professional arena was that of  desktop  video,  thanks tion (and

websites are anything to go to the machine's power in fast-moving  graphics  and  video  scan  rate, and especially Newtek's Video Toaster,  which,  paired  with  a  'big box'  Amiga,  could  replace  tens  of thousands of dollars in video switching equipment for only a few thousand. It wasn't exactly in Commodore's nature to do so, and they historically preferred the mass market to  the  niche  market,  but  I think  it  would  have  been  in  their best  interest  to  form  a  'strategic partnership' with Newtek, sharing info  and  steering  technological  directions to enrich each others' market presence, and keep a dominant hold on the desktop video market as long as possible.

Commodore didn't stay top dogs of their  respective  markets  forever, but it's always easy to think about what might have been.

Who knows what the Amiga might have been if Commodore was competent  enough  to  survive  to  the present day. It might be unrecognizable  compared  to  when  Commodore went under in 1994. Microsoft/  Windows  and  Apple/ Mac  OS  are  very  different  from their  1994  selves  after  all.  Today we have Amiga OS4, MorphOS, and AROS to show us what might have been. Then again, an 'evolved' Amiga  could  have  wound  up  as  standard Intel PC architecture running some UNIX-derivative operating system, like so many others today. It  may  yet  happen,  if  discussion threads  on  Amiga  and  MorphOS websites are anything to go by. I suppose if it happened gradually enough, not too many would complain about changes or loss of 'Amiga-nness.' I  don't  know  a lot  of  Amiga  fans nostalgic for Workbench 1.2, for example.
