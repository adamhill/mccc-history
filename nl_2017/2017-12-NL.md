## Killing Net Neutrality

[Editor's Note: This is just the latest in a series of anti-consumer actions taken by the current administration. If you haven't done so already, reach out to your representatives and let them know this is not acceptable.]

The  FCC  on  Tuesday  finally  rolled out its plan to kill off net neutrality. There's a strong chance that doing so will screw over millions of American consumers and lead to a rise in online censorship across the US.

era  net  neutrality  rules,  which  reclassified internet providers as 'common carriers' under Title II of the  Telecommunications  Act.  The reclassification allowed the FCC to impose new rules on internet providers  such  as  Verizon  and  AT&amp;T. Specifically, it made it illegal for the companies to discriminate against content by blocking or slowing traffic to websites whenever they choose.

Pai has repeatedly claimed that net neutrality  has  forced  broadband providers to decrease their investments. But that's a lie.

But  on  the  hand,  it  will make internet service providers and mobile carriers a shitload of money.

FCC  Commissioner  Jessica  Rosenworcel called Pai's justifications 'ridiculous' and 'offensive' to American consumers. 'Following actions  earlier  this  year  to  erase consumer privacy protections, the Commission now wants to wipe out court-tested  rules  and  a  decade's work  in  order  to  favor  cable  and

'You've  got  to  hand  it  to Chairman Pai,' Sen. Ron Wyden  said  in  a  statement. 'He really gets the job done for the titans of Big Cable. Tearing down net neutrality is the crowning achievement of the most anti-consumer  FCC  chair  in  history. Consumers, rural  Americans, small businesses and  pretty  much  everyone  except Big  Cable  executives  will  lose  out thanks to this terrible proposal.'

Congressman Frank Pallone Jr., the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and  Commerce  Committee, noted  that  millions  of  Americans have spoken out in defense of net neutrality. 'In making this announcement,  the  Trump  FCC  is choosing  to  ignore  the  public  and push forward with a harmful plan to  kill  net  neutrality  and  destroy the internet as we know it,' he said.

'Internet rights are civil rights,' said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. 'Gutting net neutrality will have  a  devastating  effect  on  free speech online. Without it, gateway corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T will have too much power to mess with the free flow of information.'

## Flashback

Welcome  to  another  month.  This year seems to be drawing to a close both too quickly and not nearly fast enough at the same time. It seems like one of those years of one step forward, two steps back, or if you're a public figure-run around in a circle, fall over, catch fire, then bitch  about how bad media treats you. I'm glad I'm not a public figure, though I do like to bitch about the world in small computer user group newsletters.

On the continuing saga of VampireQuest®, I have been able to contact Kipper about my ordered card, and it  looks  as  though  mine  may  have been overlooked (as in-someone in  Germany  named  Schwartz  had theirs  shipped  out,  which  caused an assumption that someone in the US named Schwartz was taken care of as well. With this error corrected, I'm hoping we can get back on track, and  back  to  waiting  for  the  right reasons,  as  opposed  to  the  wrong ones.

As  you've  no  doubt  been  aware over the last handful of articles I've written,  I  have  been  on  a  bit  of  a classic and retro-gaming kick lately. In fact I recently completed playing through  the  original  DOOM  game, thanks to a program called Odamex on MorphOS. Odamex is an 'engine' with an interface for playing DOOM files  and  related  mods,  either  one player or over networks. Even playing the original game with its original graphics, it's nice to see it running smoothly on a 1080P screen on my G5 Morph machine.

Finally, I thought I would mention a new bit of hardware I picked up. You  might  be  familiar  with  the 'Flashback' line of plug-and-play TV game systems, which covered retro consoles  from  Atari  to  Coleco  to Sega  and  more.  Last  year  I  wrote about  the  then-new  Atari  Flashback Portable handheld device. AtGames has a new 2017 edition of the  portable  available  (along  with new versions of their standard consoles,  including  versions  of  their Atari and Sega systems that output an HD signal, if not actual HD game content).

The  Atari  Portable  has  a  slightly updated  case  design,  though  functionally identical, save for the nice touch  of  making  the  rechargeable battery user-removable via a screwed-on rear panel in the newer  version.  The  directional  pad  is different in shape and feel. I don't know if I'd say it's worse than the 2016 version, but it's certainly not any better, as it was always pretty poor for me (seemingly made for a small child's thumbs, as the end of my thumb can completely cover it). The  2017  Portable  offers  seventy built-in  games  to  the  earlier  version's  sixty,  adding  some  classic gems  from  Activision  along  with Atari  versions  of  Namco-licensed arcade  games  like  Pac-Man,  Dig Dug, Galaxian, and more. It's worth noting that the Pac-Man on the portable is not  the  heavily-panned 1981  Atari  version,  but  a  much more recent and arcade-like homebrew.  Whether  this  was  done  for licensee  appeasement  or  revision- ist history is unknown. On that note, the version of Frogger which is not an  Atari  2600  version,  but  an  arcade port, remains.

Like  last  year's  model,  the  true standout  here  is  the  SD  card  slot, which lets you play your own downloaded Atari 2600 ROM files on the device.  Compatibility  and  emulation quality is far from perfect, but seems a bit improved from the previous device, and makes it easy to have  a  large  collection of  Atari games on the go.

So at roughly $50 (less at some places), is the Atari Flashback Portable (2017  Edition)  worth  getting?  If you  don't  already  have  the  2016 version, I would say sure. While it does improve on last year's model in several ways, it backsteps / sidesteps in one or two others, and it's not much of a net gain if you were paying  full  price.  Overall  though, it's a convenient method to play the majority of all Atari 2600 games in a handheld form factor, and one of the only 'Flashbacks' or other retro TV  game  systems  that  is  of  much worth (IMO you're better off with emulation on your home computer or  a  Raspberry  Pi  than  any  of  the machines that hook up to a TV). On the  downside,  the  controls  aren't too  great  (especially  if  you  have large adult thumbs) and the small LCD  screen  doesn't  always  work too well with Atari games that flicker objects on the display (which is a lot of them), but if you like your Atari games, the mix of price, capabilities, and form factor is difficult to beat (unless  maybe you have an unusually  good  setup  for  playing Atari  games  through  your  phone.) With all the classic (and not-so-classic) mini game consoles, as well as retro  mini  C-64  and  Sinclair  Spectrum either  here  or  on  the  way,  I wonder how long we have to wait until the plug-and-play Amiga mini 500 shows itself with its 50

packed-in  games?  (about  ten  of which are any good, I'd wager)

## X5000 Update

The  AmigaOne  X5000/20  was  released last year by A-EON technology featuring a  PowerPC-based dual-core Freescale CPU with a frequency of up to 2.5 Ghz. The AmigaOne  X5000/20  was  released  with modern hardware in mind offering support  for  SATA,  USB,  etc.  The AmigaOne X5000/20 also features a PCI-Express video card slot, up to 64 GB RAM, dual gigabit Ethernet ports, built-in sound, and an extra co-processor best referred to as the Xena,  an  XMOS  16-core  programmable 32-bit 500 MHz chip that can be configured by software to act as any type of custom chip imaginable. The  AmigaOne  X5000/20  is  capable  of  running  Amiga  OS  4.1  and several Linux PowerPC distros.

However, recently A-EON Technology announced that it has a more powerful  AmigaOne  X5000/40  in development  as  well,  featuring  a quad-core  PowerPC  CPU.  Details and release date are unknown. The tech company is mainly focusing on its  upcoming  AmigaOne  A1222,  a new powerful, low-cost, entry level PowerPC  motherboard  to  be  released late 2017 or early 2018.

## Amiga Reloaded

Much  like  the  C64  Reloaded,  the Amiga Reloaded will be a new Amiga motherboard using original MOS/CSG chips. It does not directly compare  to  any existing  Amiga mainboard, but if you want a comparison  basis,  then  an  A1200  is probably the closest match. Amiga Reloaded  is  an  AGA  Amiga  using the original chips-Alice, Lisa and Paula-along  with  two  CIA  chips. Other chips of the computer will be replaced by modern logic chips.

The Amiga Reloaded will not have a CPU but will work with official released  accelerator  cars  from  Individual  Computers  (ACA  series).  It would  be  very  interesting  if  Vampire team's upcoming Vampire Amiga1200 accelerator would work.

The Amiga Reloaded will use a modern laptop power supply as its only power  source.  Even  with  today's standards, the Amiga can be considered a low-power system.

The Kickstart ROMs will be properly  licensed  from  Cloanto,  and  will be  stored  in  a  flash  ROM.  Flash space will be 1 Mbyte.

After  individual  Computers  finish the  first  prototype,  they  will  take binding orders to find out the actual  demand of the Amiga Reloaded. After this order phase is over, production  will  start  and  the  boards will be delivered about 18-20 weeks after the initial order phase.
