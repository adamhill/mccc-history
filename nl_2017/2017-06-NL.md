## Vampires and Amigas

Welcome  to  another  wonderful monthly world of Amiga stuff. Perhaps  'wonderful'  is  a  bit  much, but sometimes you have to be optimistic if you want good things to happen.  In  my  continuing  'Vampire-quest saga,' there has been a thing or two that could masquerade as progress, so I'm trying to be as optimistic as possible. After a  bit  of  badgering,  I  have  word that a Vampire 600 board for me should  be  part  of  the  current batch for May. The downside (or possibly upside depending  on your  view)  is  that  no  one  has asked  me  for  any  payment  yet, but I remain observant and ready to raise hell if necessary. If only I hadn't  been  strung  along  by  delays and errors and unknown conspiracies so long. If I had a better idea  when  to  expect  a  Vampire board,  I  might  have  taken  the time  to  get  my  Amiga  600  recapped in preparation for a hopefully long and useful life.

I think about the longevity of my collection of computer hardware quite a bit nowadays, as older systems  get  'quirky'  with  age.  My Amiga and G5 Morph systems are (mostly) well-behaved, while my old Mac Mini is slow with a malfunctioning  video  card.  My  notthat-old  Linux  laptop  gained  an insensitive  'M'  key  on  the  keyboard, which makes typing a pain.,

and my tablet is kind of a cranky old man, as four and a half is equal to  mid-nineties  in  mobile  device years. It's slowly getting more imperative that I revamp my 'regular  use'  hardware  collection,  to stay ahead of failures and my own needs. (Obsolescence is a bit more  of  an  abstract  concept  for me than for many.)

The Vampire A600 would be my attempt to do so on the fully Amiga-compatible  side  of  things.  It kind  of  picks  up  the  conceptual ball dropped by the Natami project years ago. I'm keeping an eye on  their  future.  Vampire  boards for A600 and A500 are available currently (in theory), with a board for the A1200 next in line. A new AROS-based Kickstart  is  developing  alongside,  with  the  intent of not letting a set ROM or its copyright  holders  hold  back  development. This all comes together in a stand-alone 'Vampire' system, which doesn't need to piggyback  on  any  Amiga  hardware (presumably  with  some  Amiga chipset-alike built into the FPGA). Needless to say I'll try to keep my eye on future developments, and might get a stand-alone system if the specs and price are right.

I've  looked  into  the  Amiga's  and Commodore's shortcomings in previous articles, and in the interests  of  positivity,  I  thought  this time I would talk a bit about those 'good feelings' associated with the Amiga, in the senses of the general

and the nostalgic. I like to believe most  of  those  Amiga  users  out there can identify with the things I write here, in some sense, especially  if  they  have  been  in  the game long-term. It's easy for people to dismiss the Amiga's achievements in these days when pretty  much  any  cheap  desktop or handheld thing can do photos, music files, and hi-def video. But if  you  got  into  Amiga  early  on, especially  in  the  eighties,  it  was apparent how ahead of its time it was,  whether  it  was  your  first computer, or you were moving up from some 8-bit system. Not a lot was  available  in  the  consumer market  back  then  which  offered full  color  graphics  approaching photographic quality, stereo digital audio, fast animation abilities suitable for gaming or videographic use, and a genuine multitasking operating system all in a single package. It was a multimedia and desktop video system before people had any understanding of what those terms meant. It was the gold standard  for  gaming  when  the    machine  was  programmed  well.  It might  not  have  kept  its  performance  lead  as  the  nineties  ushered the game consoles and Windows PCs to the front, but we Amiga people knew we were doing  the  impressive  stuff  long  before the impressive stuff became commonplace. (It only took them a  little  under  a  decade  to  catch up.)

History  is  written  by  the  victors, because everyone knows Nintendo invented the video game industry, not some upstart called Atari. Documentaries are  happy  to  tell the  tale  of  how  visionaries  like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs built the modern computer from the ground up. Sometimes they forget the lesser known visionaries with just as strong an impact on where we  are  today-people  like  Jack Tramiel, who had a vision of the home  computer  being  an  appliance  affordable  for  anyone,  and people  like  Jay  Miner,  who  envisioned a powerful home comput- er  with  full  color and quality sound in a time when limited or monochrome displays and  buzzers  were the  order  of  the day.

The joy of the Amiga  user  came  out of the machine's potential, especially once the software  base  began to build. Game players  had  their enjoyment in games superior to other available platforms (when the effort was made beyond a simple port). Creators had it even better, with the capacity to create graphics,  whether  painted,  digitized,  or  raytraced,  animation  in the  same  categories,  sound  and music,  printed  documents,  programming demonstrations, games, applications, or any combination of those. With personal creation comes a feeling of accomplishment,  the  knowledge that you have added to the world in  some  tiny  way.  You  can't  get that feeling from answering your e-mail and browsing social media sites (believe me).

Some have singled out the Amiga as the computer with 'soul.' Many talented people poured their  heart  and  soul  and  sweat and tears into creating the system, but the best part is it didn't end there,  because  even  more  talented people poured their soul into their own machines to create, and enjoy the creations of others.
