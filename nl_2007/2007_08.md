## World's Fastest Broadband

A 75 year old woman from Karlstad in central Sweden has been thrust into the IT history books - with the world's fastest internet connection.

Sigbritt Löthberg's home has been supplied with a blistering 40 Gigabits per second connection, many thousands of times faster than the average residential link and the first time ever that a home user has experienced such a high speed.

But Sigbritt, who had never had a computer until now, is no ordinary 75 year old. She is the mother of Swedish internet legend Peter Löthberg who, along with Karlstad Stadsnät, the local council's network arm, has arranged the connection.

- 'This is more than just a demonstration,' said network boss Hafsteinn Jonsson.
- 'As a network owner we're trying to persuade internet operators to invest in faster connections. And Peter Löthberg wanted to show how you can build a low price, high capacity line over long distances,' he told The Local.

Sigbritt will now be able to enjoy 1,500 high definition HDTV channels simultaneously. Or, if there is nothing worth watching there, she will be able to download a full high definition DVD in just two seconds.

The secret behind Sigbritt's ultra-fast connection is a new modulation technique which allows data to be transferred directly between two routers up to 2,000 kilometres apart, with no intermediary transponders.

According to Karlstad Stadsnät the distance is, in theory, unlimited there is no data loss as long as the fibre is in place.

'I want to show that there are other methods than the old fashioned ways such as copper wires and radio, which lack the possibilities that fibre has,' said Peter Löthberg, who now works at Cisco.

Cisco contributed to the project but the point, said Hafsteinn Jonsson, is that fibre technology makes such high speed connections technically and commercially viable.

'The most difficult part of the whole project was installing Windows on Sigbritt's PC,' said Jonsson.

## Jim Butterfield Passes

from Ernie Chorny

I regret to advise the Commodore community that Jim Butterfield has passed away. Jim died at 1:30 AM on June 29 after battling cancer which infected many parts of his body.

His family advises that there will not be a funeral as such but a commemoration of Jim's life is planned in the next month or two.

At the moment that is all the detail that I have to report.

We have all lost a truly wonderful friend and teacher.

This is is Jim Butterfield's obituary from the July 7 Toronto Star newspaper:

BUTTERFIELD, Frank James peacefully at Princess Margaret Hospital on Friday, June 29th, 2007. Dearly loved husband of Vicki and father of Susannah. Survived by his big brother Jack (Winnie) and baby sister Meg (Cliff). Uncle Jimmy was loved by many nieces and nephews. Jim was born in Ponoka, Alberta on February 14th, 1936. He gave up his career in communications in 1981 to take on the role he most loved Computer Guru Extraordinaire to a host of geeks and non-geeks drawn to the world of Commodore Computers. A private funeral has taken place and a celebration of Jim's life will be announced later in the summer. If you wish, you may remember Jim with a donation to your favourite charity. A heartfelt thanks to the wonderful staff on 15B at Princess Margaret Hospital.

## Commodore(?) Computers

by Hilbert Hagedoorn July 13, 2007 - 11:09 PM

We found out back in March that the Commodore name had been scooped up by a Netherlands-based company looking to reinvent the brand as a modern gaming PC. Now we get wind of the new lineup of PCs coming soon (this quarter) to the States, first via online sales, with an unnamed big-box retail presence following afterward.

Commodore's new PC case looks plain, but its sturdy allmetal design is nice and solid.

Commodore will re-emerge with four basic systems, each with a little bit of wiggle room in terms of its configuration, at least when you order online. Prices start around the $1,700 mark for the most basic Commodore Cg, and they climb progressively to the highest-end Cxx, although Commodore is still working out the baseline costs of the pricier models. All will come with Intel quad-core processors, Nvidia 8000-

August 8  - MCCC Board of Director's Meeting Approx. 9:15 pm - Location TBD

August 25  - Newsletter Deadline - 7:00 am series graphics cards, Corsair RAM, and Asus-made NForce motherboards. And while Commodore won't be overclocking out of the box, it will be providing all of its systems with a proprietary Peltier-cooling heat sink, that it claims will give gamers room to ramp up their parts themselves.

In addition to the hardware, each Commodore system also comes with one of a selection of Ckins (pronounced 'see-kins') essentially customer-selected paint jobs, that grace the front and two side panels. All three panels are also designed to pop off easily, and Commodore will offer replacement panels with new art for roughly $300, which includes sound dampening and other features.

Yeahronimo Media Ventures, which has offices in Los Angeles and Baarn, the Netherlands, acquired the rights to the Commodore name late last year in a deal worth just over $32.7 million. Earlier this year, it took on Commodore as its own corporate moniker. The rebranded company already has some products available in Europe and on its Web site, but hopes to enter the U.S. market at the Computer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.
