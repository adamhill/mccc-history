## METCOM 96 The Review

This year's METCOM was not as large as in the previous years, but was just as fun. A number of things conspired against us, but we made it though just the same. The foremost item that went against us was the fact that the Texas Rangers had changed the starting time of their game scheduled for 7:30pm to 12:05pm. I'm sure that this discouraged many people from attending the show. But the ones that did attend learned about surfing the Internet with an Amiga, picked up some bargains, and had a good time.

Our registered attendance was down to 132 people. Some came from as far away as Austin, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina! While our attendance was down, the sales in the flea market were up more than 33 percent. I would like to thank all the collectors for their hard work in making this year's flea market a success. I would also like to thank Eddie Corr, John Parsons, Lowell Sumerlin, Joe Algermissen, Mike and Shirley Bond and all the rest for their help in setting up and running the flea market during the day.

A VIScorp representative was unable to attend METCOM this year in person, but Jason Compton did agree to be with us via an Internet chat line. Unfortunately we had a number of technical difficulties that prevented us from connecting up with Jason. As a backup I did obtain a taped interview with Jason that was done approximately a month earlier at a meeting of the Atlanta Amiga inc. user group. The tape was very informative about VIScorp and Jason's opinions and views on the past, present and future of the Amiga.

The BeBox Computer did put in an appearance at METCOM. One of our members, Scott Walters, brought in his own Bebox and gave demos throughout the day, including a running Amiga emulator. The little I was able to see of the BeBox impressed me enough that ! hope to be able to learn more about it when I have more time. It would make a great demo at one of our club meetings. (Hint, hint) Thank you Scott for your time and effort.

The classes were well attended with about twelve in Bill Raecke's Internet Installation and about the same for David Campbell's What to do on the Internet. Unfortunately I was busy and could not attend either class, but both classes were well received. A big thanks to Bill and David for all the hard work they put into preparing for and running the classes, and to David Owens, our club's Education Chair, for putting together and arranging the classes.

Commodore Country was the lone dealer to attend this year, but it appeared that business was brisk at their tables. I would like to thank Commodore Country for all the door prizes that they donated. Nova Design also sent /mage FX as a door prize. Several of our members donated a large number of items for door prizes this year, so everyone received a door prize at the final drawing. In fact, you had to take door prize in order to leave!

And finally, I would like to thank everyone else that helped out at METCOM 96, many whom helped in more then one area (if I miss anyone I'm sorry). Joanna Owens and Evelyn Racke who ran the registration table and gave out those lucky winning tickets. Ned Kelly for handling the club's Amiga software library. Okiey Moss for working the registration table. Wayne Brodnax, John Malmstrom and Johnny Kitchens for their help throughout the day with everything. And, most of all, 1 would personally like to thank my family, especially my wonderful wife Genie, for putting up with me and helping out the entire day!

And finally, METCOM is YOUR show. I welcome your comments or suggestions. Please feel free to contact me.

## The Amiga A Testimonial In PC Week!

The Jinxed Machine Rises Once Again, Maybe, Dept.: The hapless Amiga, a machine a decade ahead of its time (there's a lesson in there somewhere) was sold by a bankrupt Commodore to Germany's Escom AG two years back. Users hoped the sale would signal a revival, but Escom AG couldn't do anything with it and went bankrupt in July 1995, leaving the Amiga in shambles. Now, the machine's design has been sold to ViScorp, a Chicago-based set-top-box maker. Meanwhile, as a result of the bankruptcy, numerous companies are claiming rights to the machine.

No matter. VIScorp plans to revive the machine. There is some talk about porting the Amiga's OS code to the PowerPC, which would probably be a great idea, since the Amiga OS remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous multitasking capability the likes of which have only recently been developed in OS/2 and Windows NT. The biggest difference is that the Amiga OS could operate fully and multitask in as little as 256K of address space. Even today, the OS is only about 1MB in size. And to this day, there is very little a memoryhogging, CD-ROM-loading OS can do that the Amiga can't. Tight code - there's nothing like it.

I've had an Amiga for maybe a decade. It's the single most reliable piece of equipment I've ever owned. It's amazing! You can easily understand why so many fanatics are out there wondering why they are alone in their love of the thing. The Amiga continues to inspire a vibrant — albeit cultlike - community, not unlike that
