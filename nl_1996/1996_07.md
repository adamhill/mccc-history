## New BBS Subscription

At the June Board of Director's meeting, the club approved the establishment of a new BBS subscription. The subscription includes all normal BBS features including full access to the online library, the message bases and games. The subscription does not include any other club benefits and priviledges...no Newsletter, no access to the disk library at club meetings, no club discounts at local dealers or reduced prices for METCOM classes or other club events.

Why? The Board felt there might be those in the club or who have dropped out of the club recently who have little interest in anything the club has to offer other than the BBS. For those people, this will be a less expensive option. This action may keep people active on the BBS who would have dropped out. It may even entice some recent members to rejoin us in this reduced capacity.

How much? The BBS subscription is just $24 annually, in line with most other area BBS's. It can be upgraded to a full MCCC membership for just an additional $1 per month through the end of the BBS subcription, making the total $36 per year just like the ordinary membership plus BBS. Here is a rundown of the current fee

| MCCC Membership (annual)       | $24   |
|--------------------------------|-------|
| MCCC Membership (6 months)     | $15   |
| BBS with membership (annual)   | $12   |
| BBS with membership (6 months) | $ 6   |
| BBS Subscription               | $24   |

If you have recently let your MCCC membership lapse, please reconsider. We'd love to have you back as either a member or a BBS subscriber. Just send your check to:

## New Meeting Place

The Amiga-by-the-Loop Chapter is moving to a new location in August that will provide us with better facilities. The new location will provide us with overhead projectors, phone lines and plenty of parking. We will begin meeting at the Bell Helicopter training facility at the corner of Hwy 10 (also Hurst Blvd.) and Precinct Line in Hurst on August 13. See the map below for details. This is a little advance notice. Be sure to set this information aside so you don't go to the wrong spot in August. In the meantime, the July 9 meeting will be held at the old location in the North Richland Hills Community Center. We'll be looking for you.

## METCOM News

Once again METCOM is upon us and the officers are scurrying about trying to pull all of the loose ends together so that this METCOM will as great as those in the past. As in the past, we expeci to have dealers showing the latest, the best flea market this side of Trader's Village, door prizes, classes, etc.

Being the educational director this year, and after polling the membership, it was decided that we would offer Internet classes again this year. We are planning two different types of classes in our discussions... one to discuss connecting to the Internet, and one to learn what the Internet is and what you can do once you are connected. There will be more details and registration information in next month's newsletter.

This year's METCOM will be held, as usual, at the Arlington Convention Center near The Ballpark in Arlington. This year's date will be September 28. Hope to see you at METCOM this year.

## Typesmith Problem

TypeSmith 2.5 + from Soft-Logik has the capability of converting TrueType fonts to PostScript Type 1, PageStream or Compugraphic format, for use in programs which cannot use TrueType directly. The resulting conversion work fine in Amiga DTP programs (thought not always in some of Microsoft's Windowsbased programs).

But they can also apparently disappear!

A few weeks ago, after converting the TrueType font GRAVER. TTF to Type 1 and using PageStream's Font Manager to add it to the font list, the font name was nowhere to be found. The Font Manager showed that the GRAVER. PFB and GRAVER, AFM files had been loaded, but the font name just didn't show up in the font list.

Then, going back to TypeSmith, I discovered that the font name in the title bar above the character display wasn't GRAVER, it was Untitled.

TypeSmith can convert a filename from the .TTF extension to .PFB and .AFM extensions, but it cannot invent Font Name, Family Name and Full Name entries from the data in the TrueType file. So unless these data are hand entered, using the Font Attributes requester, the font will be exported with "Untitled" in each of these fields of the PostScript headers. And that's how the font will be listed in the PageStream font list.

The complaint of the disappearing conversions actually turned up some months ago on the Soft-Logik BBS. I should have paid attention then to Mike Loader's explanation of the problem. But now that it's printed in NA), next time I can locate it.
