## Code name: Albox

A leap forward towards realising a vision phase 5 digital products talks about their upcoming new product

## The product - the data - the facts

October 22, 1996: phase 5 digital products are pleased that they are now able to announce the longawaited specifications for the new computer system scheduled for 1997 and based on a powerful Custom Chip technology. Under the name of the current project, AlBOX, we are realising a trail-blazing visionary concept that explodes the barriers of today's standards. As an extremely powerful and creative personal workstation, A\BOX will appeal to all users who wish to work actively and creatively with the most modern technology and who have no desire to put up with the limitations imposed by mass hardware products that have fallen victim to a costcutting spree nor by the restraining software corsets of systems that are intended purely for passive consumers and users. With the enormous power it offers and its integrated functions the AlBOX project can claim to be implementing a computer design that is as innovative, as outstanding and as exceptionally cool as the Amiga 1000 was 12 years ago — a computer design that all Amiga enthusiasts can welcome as the reincarnation of their favourite computer system on a state-of-the-art technical level.

## The hardware of the AIBOX

The computer project we announced has given rise to a great deal of inaccurate speculation, rumours and false information which have been bandied about in general discussion forums (in many Internet newsgroups for example) during the last few months. This is why we would first like to put the record straight and deliver a few basic facts about the A BOX concept. The A\BOX project does not specify a system that builds up on standard technologies such as PCI-based graphical chips. We at phase 5 digital products take the view that a new innovative computer must also offer innovative hardware to match in order to stand out among the current PC designs and overcome the limitations they impose. On the other hand, this in no way implies that in designing an innovative computer we need to depart in any way from standards that are useful and meaningful for the user of the system (such as a PCI bus for simple expansions, the use of standardised RAM modules, standard interfaces etc.). The technological innovation, rather, is to be found on a level of integration which is of central importance in controlling the system. And despite the effort involved, which we will be going into later, today's modern methods of design and production make it possible to realise such an innovative concept in the form of ASIC's at an extremely competitive price. The central component of the AlBOX is a novel Custom Chip which is now under development at phase 5 digital and which will be responsible for many important functions in the system. These include complete memory administration and processor linkup, all DMA-like functions including video and audio DMA, blitter-type functions, I/O and control functions. A team of experienced chip and hardware designers are working on the realisation of this sophisticated concept, supported by software designers and aided by the most modern, high-level synthesis tools for VHDL-based designs. During the first half of 1997 major efforts will go into phases of simulation and testing, the result of which will be the production of the first silicon tapeout. This will be followed by the mass production of the ASIC's which, of course, will be put in the hands of one of the world's leading ASIC manufacturers.

In conclusion it can be said that the A\BOX project is an ambitious one which creates new techniques, a project in which we are by no means reinventing the wheel, but rather one in which we are making extensive use of the most modern techniques and development possibilities that are available today to an innovative company that is willing to invest in order to develop an outstanding, powerful and competitive product.

## The Silicon Dream

The heart of the AlBOX is the system controller, CAIPIRINHA, which will realise the functional integration on which the AlBOX concept is based. CAIPIRINHA opens up new dimensions of power and technology. CAIPIRINHA will be implemented as a VLSI custom Chip design in 0.35 um CMOS ASIC technology using a modern, probably 575-pole BGA housing. With a bus width of 128 bits to the memory bus, extensive dualport buffers and FIFO's in the data lines, and clock rates of initially 100 Miz externally and 200 MHz internally, CAIPIRINHA can provide an intense data throughput and powerful additional functions which do not rely on the processor, such as support for 3D and multimedia applications.

## The corner-stones of the CAIPIRINHA design:

- 128-bit high performance UMA (Unified Memory Architecture) controller, using fast SDRAMs with a clock frequency of 100 MHz and a maximum band width of up to 1.6 G-bytes/second
- 64-bit processor bus with a maximum clock rate of 100 Mhz
- two 24-bit video DMA units with freely addressable access, with integrated 24-bit video DAC's
- four 16-bit audio outputs, 44.1 KHz with any number of virtual tracks, sample output, FM and AM synthesis video-in ports for 2 independent
- video inputs in Y/UV 4:2:2 quality
- LCD (TFT) çontroller according to the VESA standard,
- audio inputs in 16-bit stereo CD quality
- a PCI-bus interface for medium-performance I/O applications
- a local 16-bit DMA bus with 66.7 MHz and a maximum band width of 132 M-bytes/second for universal lowcost applications
- an integrated IEEE 1394 firewire controller for digital 1/0 applications
- a desktop bus interface.

CAIPIRINHA is basically designed as a highly complex system and memory controller in the form of a SOMA Engine (Sole Memory Access). At the same time CAIPIRINHA manages all access to the A \BOX memory which takes the form of a highly powerful Unified Memory Architecture (UMA). All external memory access, including that of the processor, only occurs virtually and is administered and implemented by CAIPIRINHA. Unified Memory Architecture means that the entire system memory is made available as a unified memory which stores all types of data, such as programs and their data, display data, 3D-textures or Z-buffer data, audio data, incoming flows of video data etc. etc. and which can be addressed by all functional units in the system. For the user UMA means that the entire memory in the system is available for all applications at all times. When the memory is expanded with inexpesnive SDRAM modules, the additional memory capacity is then always available for all applications and functions in the system. In terms of its principle UMA corresponds to the Amiga Chip RAM · which can be addressed both by the processor and by the custom chips and video and audio DMA units of the Amiga. Unlike the Chip RAM, however, and unlike the low-cost attempts made to implement UMA memories in the PC field, the memory subsystem of the AlBOX in the form of a unified memory architecture will be implemented with 128 bits databus width and by use of synchronous DRAM's which have a speed of 100 MHz, which allows a band width of 1.6 G-bytes/second. A special method of controlling the SDRAM modules also considerably reduces latency times when accessing the memory. Due to the integration of the video DMA into

...hardware windows for example, can be superimposed and moved around anywhere with their full content, without any delay or jerkiness, even with moving animation or video sequences.

CAIPIRINHA the UMA memory can simultaneously be used as a display memory. CAIPIRINHA provides two video DMA engines: one 220 MHz high-performance video output for resolutions of up to 1600 x 1280 pixels with 24 bits and a refresh frequency of 75 Hz and a Genlockcapable 135 MHz video output for a second monitor or image output in video resolutions such as PAL/NTSC or SVHS. The video output of the 135-MHz output can be superimposed as a window on the 220 MHz display while both video DMA's are in parallel operation. Unlike conventional raster scan displays, CAIPIRINHA's video DMA engines function on the basis of a random memory access (Random Access Display), which makes it possible to display any data in visual form at any random screen positions. With this method windows, as hardware windows for example, can be superimposed and moved around anywhere with their full content, without any delay or jerkiness, even with moving animation or video sequences. Special pipelines and FIFO buffers within CAIPIRINHA's video DMA ensure a stable data throughput. The complex display possibilities are controlled by an integrated display-list RISC processor (DLRP). As the video DMA engines always have an output in 24-bit display mode, it is, of course, possible to mix any depth of shade at will. In this way, for example, on a memory-saving background with a colour depth of 8 bits it is possible to display 16-bit and 24-bit windows in any position. Of course CAIPIRINHA makes it possible to open and display virtual screens of any size and to make use of the capacity of the entire RAM. For example an imageprocessing application can open a virtual screen of 4000 x 4000 pixels in 24 bits in a system expanded to 72 M-bytes and scroll it in a display that can be represented on the monitor in 1280 x 1024 pixels without any delay or

jerkiness. Another interesting feature of CAIPIRINHA's video DMA engines is the fact that windows need no longer be merely rectangular, but can assume practically any outlines. Last, but not least, video data in the RAM which are intended for output can be stored in various formats such as RGB, YUV or CMYK and displayed simultaneously. It goes without saying that CAIPIRINHA has a highly complex functional unit (FAME, Flexible Area Movement Engine) for rapidly writing into, copying and linking memory locations or images, and which, in a similar way to the hardware windows that can be displayed with CAIPIRINHA, can assume practically any outlines and not merely the rectangular forms we know from classical blitters (block image transferers). At the same time a parallel DSP-RISC type processing unit is also integrated into this functional unit. With a very compact set of commands this allows fully programmable image and signal processing and matrix operations. This means that FAME supports special multimedia and 3D applications which can make optimum use of this supportive processing capacity which is available parallel to that of the CPU. Because it is a programmable DSPRISC processing unit, however, FAME is not limited to today's standards. Its powerful features are also available for future standards such as new 3D or video-compression algorithms. Audio output via CAIPIRINHA physically occurs via 2 channels in 16-bit CD quality. Internally the

The type'of processor we intend to use will be the Initial PowerPC processors of types 603e and 604e. Theoretically these can be operated with clock frequencies of up to 500 MHz. At present, with the first A\BOX design, a maximum of two processors can be connected on the CAIPIRINHA processor bus.

number of virtual audio tracks is limited only by the memory space available. FAME is able to engineer realtime generation and mixing of various audio tracks in any random format (e.g. also 24-bit audio) without making demands on the processor. It is also possible to generate various sound effects, a feature which is optimally supported by functions similar to DSP. In general digital samples, FM-synthesized sounds and envelope VCO generated tones can be generated, modified, mixed and output via these freely programmable audio-DMA. In addition to these superb functions CAIPIRINHA offers a full range of additional controlling functions: an integrated PCI-bus controller controls the PCI expansion bus which is available for low-cost standard expansions in the lower performance range or for I/O applications with medium band width (e.g. Ultra-SCSI or ATM). A local 16bit DMA bus is available for further I/O applications, and an interesting and easy-to-implement interface is specially available for hardware manufacturers who do not want to work with standard PCI components. Another important feature which will play a major role in future multimedia applications is the integrated IEEE 1394 firewire bus. A large number of electronic enhancements for computer and consumer can connected via this high-speed serial bus.

## The general system design of the AlBOX

The AlBOX system will be implemented as a progressive and innovative concept of a personal workstation which offers extremely good value for money. As we have mentioned, the system builds up on the innovative CAIPIRINHA chip which serves as the functional heart of the system. The type of processor we intend to use will be the Initial PowerPC processors of types 603e and 604e. Theoretically these can be operated with clock frequencies of up to 500 MHz. At present, with the first AlBOX design, a maximum of two processors can be connected on the CAIPIRINHA processor bus; a corresponding expansion option for the second processor will be available in the AlBOX design. The memory can be expanded by using inexpensive standard SDRAM modules with a width of 64 bits (168-pin JEDEC DIMMS). In future these SDRAMs will increasingly be replacing slower, traditional DRAMs. Eight slots will be available so that the memory can be expanded to a maximum capacity of 1 gigabyte. The slots can be expanded in pairs (due to the 128-bit mode). As a standard feature the system provides two video outputs, one of which has a maximum pixel rate of 220 MHz and the second of which can be operated at 135 MHz. In addition to this, the second video output can be synchronised externally and is thus suitable for compatible analogue video applications. Also available, naturally, are an integrated Fast SCSI-II controller with an external port and an integrated ISDN connection. Via standard video inputs two analogue video inputs can be simultaneously digitalised in Y/C quality and then processed in real time. The audio inputs and outputs also offered by CAIPIRINHA which it will, of course, be possible to synchronise with the video ports, are available in the form of Cinch jacks for processing high-quality audio data. Keyboard, mouse and other operating devices are connected up via a serial desktop bus. In addition to this, there are external connections for the IDE 1394 firewire port, the serial interface and the parallel interface. Due to the open design concept of A\BOX, the outstanding hardware features of the CAIPIRINHA system controller and the excellent operating system capacities, A\BOX offers itself as an ideal platform for unusual applications for third party developers working both in the field of software and in the field of hardware. Any I/O expansions which may be required, such as ATM boards, Ultra SCSI or RAID controllers or others can be easily adapted via the PCI bus. In addition to this, the most versatile enhancements can be developed for the A\BOX via both the PCI and the 16-bit DMA bus. At

present all options are still open as far as the housing is concerned. The mainboard design of the A\BOX will, at all events, be geared towards the usual standards so that the option of choosing a more inexpensive standard housing will be kept open in addition to a custom housing.

## A large number of options for the operating system software

A large number of options will be available for the operating system software of the AlBOX. In general the A\BOX project aims to implement an Amiga-OScompatible operating system of a state-of-the-art technical standard and to provide it as a basic operating system for

...the A\BOX project aims to implement an Amiga-OScompatible operating system of a state-of-the-art technical standard and to provide it as a basic operating system for the A\BOX.

the A\BOX. Modern functions such as support for multiprocessing are to be transparently integrated. The basis for this development has already been created in the form of the Amiga-OS 3.1 compatible operating core which is currently being tested in the software labs of phase 5 digital products. In the near future we will also be pressing ahead with more development work in cooperation with important software partners, for example on an updated GUI or other high-level components. An important aspect of this development work will be our efforts to make the operating system provide complete support for the superb possibilities offered by the hardware. In addition to this we also plan to implement a NetBSD and a Linux version for the A\BOX in cooperation with other partners. The current concepts provide for a very close integration of these OS adaptations into the basic operating system of the A\BOX so that parallel operation of the two operating systems and of software applications based on these operating toms, eily minding te ne that and already suitable for the PowerPC. In the future we might use attractive standard operating systems by way of licence agreements and emulation.

## Open concepts for the future

The A\BOX concept which we have introduced here will be structured in such a way that it is forward-looking and open. The technology used in the CAIPIRINHA

custom chip is upgradable on silicon level. This means that in the future it will be possible to implement compatible systems enhancing the functions with wider memory or wider processor buses and to realise faster versions of this custom design with higher internal clock rates. In addition to this it is conceivable that a downgraded 64-bit version will be implemented. This means that systems of average capacity (e.g. 24-bit screen resolution with a maximum of 1280 x 1024 pixels) but which possess the full functional power of the concept we have outlined can be implemented at a price range considerably below DDM 1500 or USD 1000. In order to possibly implement such a low-price version of the CAIPIRINHA Custom Chip, phase 5 digital products in the near future will be seeking contact with partners who might possibly be interested and who offer the preconditions for the large-scale manufacture and distribution of such a product. But phase 5 will also be open for OEM partnerships with regard to the massproduced AlBOX mainboards or the CAIPIRINHA system controller.

## Worldwide availability guaranteed

Worldwide availability guaranteed. For our own AlBOX systems, which will be sold in a price range starting from DM 3,000 (USD 2,000 or GBP 1,300) net (in the 150 MHz class with the basic features, i.e. a 16 M-byte memory, a hard disk in the 1 GB range and a CD-ROM disk drive) phase 5 digital products will be setting up an active international distribution system during the course of 1997, which will ensure that product and sales support is available as soon as delivery commences. This work will include selecting sales representatives, giving them preparatory training courses and opening up distribution and service branches as far as is necessary for professionally attending to important markets. The expansion of our Internet activities in the fields of sales, support, product support and marketing will make an important contribution towards distributing the system among an interest group that spans the four corners of the globe. These activities will guarantte for a worldwide availability of the A\BOX systems to interested users and customers.

## adaptor for using an at keyboard with an amiga computer by David Bump (via the internet)

T 1 he KB100 is an adaptor for using an AT keyboard with an Amiga. To install, plug the cable from the adaptor box into the computer's keyboard connector plug, and the keyboard cable into the connector on the adaptor itself. The documentation suggests that you turn your computer off during installation.

## REVIEW

The adaptor is a small box, roughly 3" by 2" by 1" in size, with a 6" long cable exiting one side of the box, and a socket on the opposite side. There are two models of the KB100, one for A2000 variants, using the 5 pin DIN connector, and another model with connectors that match · the mini DIN connector of the A4000.

The adaptor works very well, I haven't had any trouble with it in the several weeks I have been using it.

The adaptor remaps certain keys to emulate an Amiga keyboard. The Caps Lock doubles as the Ctri key (if you press it in conjunction with another key, it acts as Ctrl; if you press it alone, it acts normally). The left and right Ctrl keys are remapped to the left and right Amiga keys, respectively. The Print Screen/SysRq and Scroll Lock keys (to the right of the function keys) are also mapped to the left and right Amiga keys. F11 and F12 are mapped to the left and right parentheses. The Num Lock key (in the upper left of the keypad) is also mapped to the Ctrl key. The number lock function of an AT keyboard is not supported (the keypad acts only as a keypad, not doubling as a cursor pad). The block of keys above the cursor keys is mapped, oddly, to mouse movement. Insert, Home, Page Up and End correspond, respectively, to pointer left, up, right and down. Page Down is mapped to the Help key (this is undocumented). The rest of the keys function normally. The right Alt key may have some other function which I have been unable to discern — it is labeled, in the documentation's pictorial keymap, as "Alt Gr." The "Windows" keys of 104-key keyboards are not usefully mapped by the adaptor. The left and right windows keys both produce an apostrophe (), and the menu key produces the letter A.

The adaptor even duplicates the keyboard reboot key combination (Ctrl-Left Amiga Right Amiga) of normal Amiga keyboards. Users who have modified their A1200s for external keyboards should note that this feature may not function on their modified hardware, and may even disable the keyboard until a reboot is performed.

## DOCUMENTATION

The documentation consists of a single, one-sided sheet which describes the installation, and diagrams the keymap. This is a little sparse, but really does include everything I needed to know. I would have appreciated a table of the special keys, rather than a pictorial representation.

## LIKES

It's simple; it does precisely what it needs to. I especially like the use of the Caps Lock key doubling for CtrI — I originally thought this would be troublesome, but I have found it is completely transparent in use.

## DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The documentation could have been a bit more detailed. I would have liked support for the extra keys on 104 key keyboards, and configurable mapping of those keys.

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

I haven't used any other similar adaptor; it may be the only commercially available adaptor at this time. There is no noticeable difference, aside from becoming accustomed to new key locations, from using an Amiga keyboard.

## WARRANTY

The only mention of a warranty that I found is on the "Warranty Seal" covering the seam in the adaptor's enclosure.

## CONCLUSIONS

The device does exactly what it claims; further, it maps the special keys found on a regular Amiga keyboard - which is an essential feature. It provides an alternative to the relatively expensive Amiga keyboard; though it may not provide significant savings on the initial investment, keyboard replacements in the future will be much less expensive. I won't recommend it as an upgrade for a user who already has a working keyboard, but for those who need to replace their keyboard, or who are interested in the specialized varieties of AT keyboards, it is an excellent choice.

## Miami Tips

how to get the most out of miami and your serial port in general from the Ohio Valley Amiga Users Group Newsletter ost of the following information is from Holger Ensure that your serial baud rate setting is 38.4K and no higher. That is pretty much the limit for fast Amigas without a high speed serial card installed and applies even to a 68060/50. I have done extensive testing regarding this and the problem seems to be with the CIAs and not nearly as much with the CPU speed. Amigas with 68000/10 CPUs should not exceed 19.2K serial baud rates, regardless of modem speed. These are precisely the default settings set by Miamilnit. Anyway, the max serial speed depends on a lot of things. There are instances when even 192000 is too much, and other cases when 57600 bps is safely possible. The problem is not so much with the CIAs, but with the very small hardware buffer (only one byte) in Paula and the latency of the serial device interrupt, usually caused by bus delays. The only problem the CIAs can cause are related to RTS/CTS timing, but these problems are rather rare compared to the others.

Here is an (incomplete) list of factors that affect the max serial speed. Please note that these effects have "absolutely nothing" to do with Miami. Data Loss occurs at and below serial device, not at the application level:

- Your CPU (obviously). The faster the better :-)
- The amount of "real" fast memory. By "real" fast memory I mean memory in the Zorro-II config space or outside of the 16MB address range. Having fast memory in the system (even a little) can increase the serial speed significantly. "Slow" ("ranger") memory in the range from C00000-DBFFFF (eg. memory in the A500 memory slot) does NOT help though, even though it shows up as "fast" memory in "avail."
- A serial board (obviously), because it removes the chip mem bus bottleneck for serial 1/0, and also often has a larger hardware buffer.
- A graphics board. Having the frontmost screen on the graphics board usually reduces the load on the chip mem bus and thus speeds up interrupts.
- The number of colors on your frontmost screen. On ECS machines, DO NOT use 16 colors in hires or 4 colors in productivity/dbl-ntsc/dbl-pal. On AGA machines, DO NOT use 256 colors in productivity/dbl-ntsc/dbl-pal. Otherwise the chip mem bus becomes completely congested and your max serial rate drops dramatically. Actually, chip mem bus congestion starts earlier: for ECS machines at 16 colors lores, or 4 colors hires, or 2 colors productivity/dbl-ntsc/dbl-pal; and for AGA machines at 16 colors productivity/dbl-ntsc/dbl-pal, but the effects only become really bad for the modes listed above. This is not a problem if you have a graphics board that works independent of chip mem, of course.
- The overscan size of your screen. In particular, if you use a mode with high chip mem bus congestion, you at least want to reduce the overscan size so the chip mem bus load decreases. Again, this does not apply to graphics boards.
- The location of ExecBase and VBR. They should both be in fast mem, not chip mem. Unless you have a really old CPU board or use hacks like soft-kicking, this should always automatically be the case if you have fast mem. Only exception: if you have a 68000 Amiga, your VBR is always in chip mem, even if you have fast mem. In this case, consider replacing the 68000 with a 68010. Both chips are pin compatible, so you do not need a new CPU board for this. The 68010 is rather cheap and allows the VBR to be outside of chip mem, so it can speed up serial interrupts significantly.
- The type of handshaking you have configured. Whenever possible use hardware handshaking (RTS/CTS), make sure your modem cable transmits both signals, and configure your modem for it. Really, double check that your modem is configured for RTS/CTS handshaking "only", "not" for Xon/Xoff handshaking.
- Replacement for "serial device" can help. Some of them use a more efficient interrupt code that reduces the interrupt latency. The only replacement I can really recommend is "artser device" , because it is not too dissimilar from "serial. device", and also supports EOFmode, something that can "greatly" reduce the CPU load on your system. Most of the other replacement devices are either buggy or don't support EOF-mode.
- Owners of GVP SCSI host adapters should either get a recent version of the ROM or, probably even better, the Guru-ROM. Otherwise you need to install "GVPPatch", a program that chops IORequests into smaller pieces. This might be necessary because some versions of the original GVP software keep interrupts disabled during harddisk transfers for a long time, causing serial. device data loss.
- The type of cable. Your cable needs to transmit RTS/CTS. of course, should be as short as possible (e.g. 3 feet) and shielded. Stay away from custom-made cables or cables that are labeled "multi-purpose serial cable", "file transfer cable", "null modem cable" or "serial printer cable". Never put any devices (serial monitors, "breakout-boxes", etc.) between your computer and modem.
- Your modem firmware. Some (in particular, older) modems don't time RTS/CTS handshaking properly and can cause data loss, in particular, if your Amiga's serial interrupts are already slow anyway (see problems above). Upgrading the modem firmware can help.

## A Lawyer's Christmas Story

T'was the fight Before Christmas...

'was the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic energy was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential, including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus Musculus. Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the woodburning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific St. Nicholas.

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums. My conjugal partner and l, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the arenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself; thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a miniscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more veriginous velocity than patriotic acclaim predicates, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen — "now Dasher, now Dancer..." et al — guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 18o degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved, with utmost celerity and via a downward leap, entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the eborry residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls of said pathway. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His visual input centers were scintillating with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of albino's floral emblem, the latter that of the Prunus Avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supra-labials resembled nothing so much as a loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like a small tabular, and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking-piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirchful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impected fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in short, neither more nor less that an obese, jocund, mutigenerian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By swiftly lowering, then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.

Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned hosiery from that dorsally transported woven container. Upon completion of this task, he executed an about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement heretofore observable chiefly among the seed bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his vocalization beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to the selfsame assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubrious, beneficial, and gratifying, pleasurable period between sunset and the dawn!"

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke his month brings changes to our library beginning \_ 1200. First, the disks will finally be in fast file system format. This change allows a little more data to be squeezed onto a disk and speeds things up somewhat as well. Surely by now everyone is running with at least Workbench 2.04. As far as the default tools in the icons are concerned, all the text files, AmigaGuide files, pictures, sounds and just about everything else will assume that you have MultiView installed (comes with Workbench 3.1).

several new or updated custom classes to the MUI (Magic User Interface) system. These extensions are improvements on those provided with MUl or are new additions likely to be used by programmers in the future. It's good to keep up with the latest so that you're not looking around for them when you need them. There's a BUSY class on MCCC-A\_1181, a MONTH NAVIGATOR class on MCCC-A\_1195, and MAILTEXT and TIMESTRING classes on MCCC-A\_1196,

MCP stands for Master Control Program. What it provides is just about all the system enhancing

The other big change concerns what I put on the . MCP by ALIENDESIGN disks. We have had too many disks lately and very little interest in them. Therefore, beginning with disk 1200,

I am only going to include my picks for the month. Everything you find on the disks of the month from disk 1200 and forward will be what I consider to be a gem worth keeping. What I feature in my articles in the future will simply be everything on the disks. If you're not keeping up with the BBS, this will allow you to get the best simply by getting the latest disks from the library.

Enough about the new policies. On to the monthly picks.

MUI Custom Classes This month adds

commodities you can imagine, all rolled into a single program. Everything is included here from mouse blanking and mouse acceleration to solid window movement and a screen selection menu that appears on every screen. This program has been featured here many times in the past, but it keeps getting better. You'll find version 1.22b3 this month in archived format on disk MCCC-A\_1184.

## Pictures

This month there are a number of excellent animal pictures in the library. These are in JPEG format and are well worth adding to your collection. You'll find them on MCCC-A\_1185, 1186, 1200, 1201, 1202 and 1203.

## akJFIF datatype by Ralph Kleinert

This is the latest JPEG datatype for your system. Why another one? 'Cause this one handles all the latest JPEG file formats and is VERY fast. I haven't done any actual speed comparisons, but my feeling is that we're talking a speedup of about 10X over the older JPEG datatype. The latest version is 43.13 and it can be found on MCCC-A\_1204. You'll also find an akPNG datatype on the same disk. Although the PNG format is not widespread, there's no harm in keeping up to date.

## CyberAnim by Peter MeGavin

CyberAnim is simply an animation viewer for CyberGraphX systems. It plays any IFF ANIM format animation. If you have a CyberGraphX system, you need this one. It's on MCCC-A\_1190.

## Tracker Music

We seem to get a lot of tracker music uploaded to the BBS, but little of it is worth keeping. An exception to the rule is Ballad For Sad. You can find this excellent piece of music on MCCC-A\_1195.

## CyberShow by Helmut Hoffmann

This is the premiere picture viewing utility for CyberGraphX systems. It requires you to register in order to get a version which will display in color, but it's the only picture viewing utility I've seen that was worth the price of registration. It has every option you can think of, including a nice slideshow capability with some very nice picture transition effects. Once again, if you have a CyberGraphX system, you need this one. This is version 8.0 and it's on MCCC-A\_1197.

## PhotoAlbum by Helmut Hoffmann

Written by the same person who gave us CyberShow, PhotoAlbum will display a directory of pictures as thumbnails in a window. To view a picture full size, you double click on the thumbnail. It's a good way to get a quick look at a set of pictures. You can even store the thumbnail databases for later access. It's fast and powerful and easy to use. Like Cyber Show, you need to register to get a version capable of color displays, but it's well worth the price of admission. You'll find this one on MCCC-A \_1197.

## ASL v42.0 by Miloslaw Smyk and Marcin Orlowski

This is a replacement for the standard ASL library included with Workbench 3.0 and 3.1. With this release, ASL is now configurable and comes with a Preferences program. There are a lot of options available as well that weren't there before. The update is on MCCC-A\_1202.

## BCDPlay by Elmar Plischke

BCDPlay is a audio CD player. Unlike many of the others, this one is very straightforward and easy to use. There is no ability to save music programs, or to save CD titles or artist names. Just a simple music player with a small and easy to use interface. If that's what you're looking for, look no further than MCCC-A\_1204.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Metro C64/128

Mary Louise Hagemeyer

Due to too many people having to be in to many different places, we didn't meet in October. In November, we met a Brenda and Mike Sessums' house, causing a variety of reactions in the dozen cats and one poodle who strolled in and out of the computer room. Brenda showed us her Commodore setup, consisting of a C128D with 4.5 MB Ramlink, 2 1571 and 2 1581 disk drives, and a Memorex power center for switching devices on and off. All of this is very good when running GEOS and a tremendous improvement over the early days of GEOS on a C64 with only a 1541 drive.

Brenda demonstrated Jenny II in C64 mode. This is a genealogy program with GEDCOM capability, meaning that uses can exchange data with PC's and such. Jenny Il can be ordered from:

Basic Fundamentals Company 3366 South 2300 East

Salt Lake City, Utah 84109.

The cost for the program and instructions is $10.00. The Jenny II BASIC source code disk is available for $12.00, but no assistance is offered.

Someone asked about sending commands with the Epyx Fast Load, and the advice was to use the pound key. There was a request for public domain games for the C64; if anyone has a list of favorite games from the club library, we'd appreciate it. Mike Sessums gets Commodore questions on the Internet from all over the world, showing that even now there is a lot of interest in these 8-bit machines.

Our December meeting will be a festive one, so bring some munchies and maybe a Christmas disk. We will be meeting in the UNT Health Sciences Building at 1:30 on December 14.
