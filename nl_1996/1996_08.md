## METCOM 96

let the fun begin by Mark Stodola

Y our Mission, should you decide to accept it: Attend METCOM 96.

The Date: Saturday September 28

The Time: 10:00 AM until 5:00 PM

The Place: Arlington Convention Center

The cost: Free

The mission: Have Fun, Interact with Fellow Amigans, Locate Bargains, Acquire Knowledge, Have More fun!!

## DIRECTIONS &amp; PARKING

The Arlington Convention Center is located at 1200 Ballpark Way in Arlington. From Dallas head west on I30 and exit at Ballpark Way. Turn right at the stop sign at Ballpark Way. This will take you over I-30. The Convention Center is at the bottom of the hill on the right. From Fort Worth head east on I-30 to Nolan Ryan Expressway (exit 28B). At the traffic light turn left onto Copeland Road. At the next light turn right onto Convention Center Drive and then take another right onto Ballpark Way. The Arlington Convention Center is now charging for parking. Parking will cost $4.00 per vehicle. You will pay as you enter the Convention Center, and there are no in/out privileges.

## CLASSES

This year we will be offering two classes — both will be on the Internet. Each class will be different, so you can go to both classes and learn twice as much! The morning class will be on how to get your Amiga connected to the Internet and the afternoon class will be on what is available on the Internet once your computer is connected. We will have a phone line to surf the Net live. The cost to members will be $5 each if you pre-register and $10 each if you sign up METCOM. A registration form is included in this newsletter, so sign up soon to reserve your spot.

## FLEA MARKET

As usual, we will be having a flea market, and it is up to you to supply your unused and unwanted hardware and software. Flea market forms will be available at the August and September chapter meetings. Items will also be collected at the next two months' chapter meetings. If you can not attend the meetings, the collectors listed below have forms and will take your items. Please call one of them by September 21 to make arrangements for your items.

| Collector      | Area                            | Phone Number   |

## OTHER ATTRACTIONS

We will be having door prize drawings throughout the day. You will need to be present to win. And, as only happens at METCOM, the entire software libraries for the Amiga and the 64/128 will be there. The annual special on memberships will be offered: thirteen months for the price of twelve months. This offer is good even if your membership is unexpired. We are working on getting all of our local dealers to attend METCOM. We also hope to have a few computers set up so you can ask the club's resident gurus for help and advice.

So mark your calender for Saturday, September 28, sign up for an InterNet class or two, dust off your unused hardware and software, save up your money, and prepare for a good time. The countdown for METCOM 96 has begun!

## Final Writer 5

better than ever! by William Near, DBace

W ell, here we are again with another update to Final Writer by Softwood. The beta of Final Writer that I received looks promising and sports many improvements and additions to an already topnotch word processor.

Final Writer 5 comes on three disks and is as easy to install as previous versions due to the wise use of the Commodore Installer. Upon first glance, Final Writer 5 looks very much the same as Final Writer 4, but there's more power lurking under the surface.

## SO WHAT'S NEW AND IMPROVED ANYWAY?

I'm glad you asked! While I'm not going to cover every detail of the changes to Final Writer, I will describe the biggest changes and improvements. Of course, this is a purely subjective thing - what may be important to me might be of little to no interest to you. I'll try to cover as many points as space will allow, though.

One word: TABLES! Yes, you read that right. Table support is now included in Final Writer. No more of those ARexx hacks which were floating around on the Aminet, no matter how good they were. Tables can be created and modified from a requester in a variety of ways. You have control over: grid line appearance, color of backgrounds in cell regions, text flow around tables, multiple paragraphs in each cell, line thickness and color, and data formatting for groups of cells within a table. Even the type specs and paragraph options work within tables. This feature is most certainly one of the biggest additions to Final Writer thus far.

In the font's department there is now a menu choice for direct access to the font requester. That means no different font. Preloading fonts is now possible as well. Just select which fonts you'd like to load upon starting Final Writer or creating a new document and they will appear in the font list.

ASL (Amiga Standard Library) requesters are now an option within Final Writer. You can opt to use these requesters, the standard Final Writer requesters, or a combination of the two for selecting files or fonts to open. ASL requesters are great because you can resize and position them any way you desire, type the path name directly in the requester, use the cursor keys for navigation, and type the first letter of a filename or font and have the requester jump directly to the first entry that matches.

Final Writer now incorporates an Auto Correct feature. Auto Correct can be used to substitute one set of letters for another. For instance, you could set up an Auto Correct item that would replace each occurrence of "cm" with the word "Commodore". This would save you the effort of having to type repetitive words, especially long ones, over and over throughout your document. You could also set up an Auto Correct item that will correct your most mistyped words in a document. Let's say that you always type the word "foriegn" in your documents, you could set an item up that will automatically spell the word as "foreign". Auto Correct can even automatically capitalize the first letter in a new sentence and eliminate double capitals within a sentence.

Section click-tabs can now be displayed without also having to display page number click-tabs. This can be very useful when jumping from section to section and for preserving screen real estate by eliminating the page number click-tabs on the current document. Of course, the other click-tab options are still available.

Final Writer's custom screen is now a public screen. . This enables other programs or applications to open their windows on the Final Writer screen. ARexx programmers should find this to be especially good news.

An HTML (HyperText Markup Language) save option has been added too! Now you can create a World Wide Web page with relative ease. Just type in the text that you desire and import any graphics you'd like into the document. Save the new document with the HTML option and Final Writer will write the appropriate code for you to use! I tested it out and it seems to work fine. The only thing I wish it could do is create text links to other pages of your document. It's a nice addition that goes a long way towards helping you set up your initial HTML document.

Final Writer now allows you to save a specific set of preferences for future use. You can select any predefined preferences from a menu choice and they will be loaded and made active. This can be handy if you like to have your toolbar in a certain position while creating HTML pages and you'd like it in another position for general writing. This is a very simplified example, but you get the idea. Anything you want to adjust and save can be easily accomplished.

Finally, Rich Text Format (RTF) support is here! This is a method used by many word processors on differing platforms to save a document and import it into another package with a minimum of formatting loss. Now you can easily take your Final Writer documents to and from work with ease.

Sections within your document can now be easily rearranged. No longer do you have to use the clunky cut and paste method. Now you can just drag the section names from within a requester to whatever position you'd like them to appear in your document.

Documents can now be created with a template. If you open an existing document with the New From Template menu choice, Final Writer will update all time

and date insertions in the document and rename it as Untitled. This will prevent you from saving over top of the original document when making revisions. This has happened to me in the past while writing reviews for Amiga Report. You have the Auto Save feature set and the next thing you know you've just overwritten your original document that you were modifying! This won't happen any more.

The Zoom options have been moved into a direct pulldown menu choice. Now it is much faster to change the magnification of your document to one of the eight predefined choices. Of course, you can still set the magnification manually from the requester as in past versions of Final Writer.

Great news for Workbench 3.x users - Final Writer now supports Datatypes for importing any kind of graphic into your documents.

The grammar checker has been updated to the latest version too.

Floating palettes are now available for the Tool, Button, and Style bars. The Button and Style palettes are resizable, while the Tool palette is not.

## ALL THIS AND WINDOWS TOO

Softwood has also released a version of Final Writer for the Windows-based machines. Now you can use Final Writer on your Windows and Workbench systems. The files are completely portable between both versions and a special deal has been offered by Softwood to buy them both at the same time.

I would like to add that this in no way means that Softwood is defecting to the enemy. They are just trying to open up their product on other platforms and have assured us that the Amiga version's development will continue into the foreseeable future. So don't worry!

## WISH LIST

I wish that there was an insert file option in Final Writer. I really hate having to open a second document and then cut and paste the information into my working document. I would like to see a mail merge to file option too, instead of having to wait endlessly while Final Writer generates each page of a mail merge. I could generate the merged file and print it later. A page preview feature would also be nice. Sure, I can set the Zoom to 55% or so, but it doesn't appear on its own screen. Finally, I'd like to be able to create links on the HTML pages, but this first effort in this area by Softwood is still pretty good.

## SUMMARY

Once again, Softwood has done a great job of revising an already powerful word processor for the Amiga. Woody and the gang should be commended for sticking by the Amiga throughout the thick and thin times of this platform's sordid history. So, go out and buy the upgrade or buy Final Writer for the first time — you won't be sorry.

## AsimCDFS

## What you need to get you going

nstalling a CD-ROM sounds complicated with all 1 o 2 a ho as what she Many repo settings, and who knows what else. Many people are confused as to what you need to start, what software to buy, what support is there, and what the heck is a CD ROM anyway? Well, it's a small compact disc that holds about the same as 650 floppy disks. There is now loads of support for CD-ROMs on the Amiga platform. You can get Aminet archives, Fred Fish collections, games, MOD collections...you name it and somebody has shoved it on a CD. Okay, so you know what a CD-ROM is, but how do you make one work in your computer? AsimCDFS is how.

I was amazed at how easy the install was the first time I used AsimCDFS. I had just put in a Atapi 6x CD. ROM into my A4000T, I ran the Asim CDFS software and bingo — all I had to do is select 'Atapi' and it did the rest. The software is so simple to install you'll be laughing. Alright, so AsimCDES is a great driver for almost all CD ROMs on the Amiga, but that's only of a fraction of what AsimCDFS does.

Asim Tunes is a program included in the package. It is an excellent audio CD player. When you insert an Audio CD it recognizes how many tracks there are on it. You can relabel all the tracks with the correct name (Instead of "Track 02' you can change it to 'It's Raining Men' or whatever the track may be called) and every time you put that CD back in it will recognize it and get the info from the database, (Track 2 will show up as 'It's Raining Men'everytime you put that CD back in). You can build this library as large as you like.

Another program included in this package is the SimBoot program, which will emulate a CD32 (if you have an A4000 or A1200 with a CD-ROM), and will boot off a CD32 CD that you have, like Pinball Fantasies, Chaos Engine, or whatever.

AsimCDFS offers a very wide range of compatibilty for different file formats (it'll read Mac, and PC Cd's as well) and has a variety of options. This is the only choice for CD-Rom management on your Amiga. Visit Asim Innovations' webpage for more details. //

So now you know what programs are included with AsimCDFS, now here is what makes CDFS's so wonderful. When you insert an Audio CD into your CD-ROM, CDFS recognizes the format and gives you an icon on the workbench to open up the CD. When you open it up, it automatically converts all of the tracks into AIFF Stereo, AIFF Right, AIFF Left, MAUD, and Raw. This feature allows you to access the tracks right off the CD instead of downgrading the sound through digitizing. Also, if you insert a Kodak or Corel PhotoCD it will recognize the format and will automatically covert all the pictures on the CD into IFF's to view through Multiview or any other pic viewer. It even generates thumbnail icons of what the pictures look like.

## Browse

all it's cracked up to be? author unknown ur recent Battle of the Browsers compared the platform. Just recently IBrowse R8a was released, and changed everything. For those of you who have never used IBrowse before, IIl give you a description.

IBrowse has the best HTML 3.2 support out of all of the Amiga browsers. It will display everything from coloured fonts, sized fonts, and tables. And now IBrowse will even do 89a GIF Animations, which is something amazing to see on the Amiga platform. Although I am not sure (as the makers of IBrowse never sent me a full copy), I have been told that the final commercial version of IBrowse will support gopher, FTP, news, mail, and telnet (these have all been disabled in the demo version), which means that IBrowse is so complete that it can even give Netscape or Microsoft Explorer a run for their money. There's not much else to say about what HTML commands IBrowse does - it simply does them all (except frames). It is the most advanced browser I've seen for the Amiga yet. IBrowse will also let you drag n' drop the icon bar to change its position on screen (something even Netscape or Explorer won't do). You can also drag n' drop the status bar or the animation, giving you a wide range of configurability.

It, of course, has the standard options such as changing fonts and the ability to change the 'fast link' buttons. And its 'external viewer' configuration panel is a bit more advanced than Voyager's, or AWeb's. It looks most similar to Netscape's.

Also, because IBrowse uses its own image decoding library, it supports progressive GIFs (when loading a picture, instead of showing a blank box it displays how much has loaded). No other Amiga browser currently supports this. You can also turn off the image decoding library and just use datatypes if you wish. If you click the right mouse button when over an image you get a pull down menu with such options as 'Save/Download Image to Disk' or 'View Image Separately'. It's nothing amazing but it does come in handy now and then. They've even thrown in a Cache browser now (very similar to

Voyager's).

IBrowse is simply the best browser there is for the Amiga platform at the moment. It looks great, it's extremely user friendly, and it supports almost all the HTML 3.2 commands. It's still slow on an A1200 with 2

megs of RAM, but its slickness and performance well makes up for that.

Speed: 86%

The speed improved a bit since R7 but it's not really noticeable. When you encounter background colors it seems to take forever to display.

## VIScorp

An Open Letter from Bill Buck, CEO, VIScorp

July 2, 1206 Chicase, Minois 1. Escom AG and Amiga Technologies GmbH are in bankruptcy and will cease to exist as corporate entities. VIScorp has reached an agreement with the Trustee for the liquidation of these companies and with the creditors of these companies for the purchase of "Amiga." There were at least eleven different banks or companies that had claims to be "owners" of the technology and/or the inventory. Escom had liabilities of over $250 million. Imagine the confusion...

2. The steps that we had to follow through the last three
2. months were painstaking. As the situation at Escom deteriorated, we had to continually re-negotiate our purchase contract. We could not speed-up the process. Many things we wanted to begin immediately we have had to delay. The situation at Amiga and Escom were extremely troubled. This was in part because of the difficult financial and management situations at Amiga and Escom, but also because of how poorly organized the intellectual property had been under Commodore. In the course of the Commodore bankruptcy many problems developed that were never repaired.
3. The final (and last of three) purchase contract was signed on Friday, 19 July. It cannot be changed; it has been executed. The intellectual property of the former Commodore and the inventory of the former Amiga Technologies will be owned finally by VIScorp. The final paperwork will be completed in the next 30 days. During this month, VIScorp GmbH will be registered and Amiga Technologies will continue to operate temporarily in bankruptcy for VIScorp.
4. Petro Tyschtschenko and his staff will continue to operate from Germany. Raquel Velasco and Petro Tyschtschenko will be the new General Managers of Amiga, to be known as VIScorp GmbH. Al Duncan, a former General Manager of Commodore, will join VIScorp to manage the sales and distribution of VIScorp and Amiga products in North America. Petro will continue to operate from Germany and manage the existing business. Raquel is looking for someone from the community to manage the re-organization of the sales and distribution in Europe. Please contact Raquel if you are the right
5. person for this job.

## CyberGraphX Tools

This is a good month for those of us with CyberGraphX systems. There are a number of programs on this month's disks suited to us. CyberView, by Matthias Scheler, is a powerful image viewing utility for systems equipped with CyberGraphX. Version 3.0 can be found on MCCC-A\_1111. On this same disk is version 3.1 of Cyber Window by the same author. This is another image viewing utility, but this one shows images in windows on the Workbench rather than on a separate screen. The only requirement is that you must be running a your Workbench in at least 15 bitplane mode (32,768 colors)...but isn't everyone?

On MCCC-A\_1116 is version 7.2 of CyberShow, the premier image viewing utility by Helmut Hoffmann. This one requires that you register in order to view images in color. All I can say is, it's worth the registration fee. After registering, you receive a key file that is recognized by all the updates, so it's easy to keep current. It allows you to view virtually any kind of image any way you like. In a window on the Workbench, on a separate screen, with or without window borders, as a slideshow, with or without image transition effects, in any screen mode you specify, with or without image scaling/zooming, etc. It even provides a handy way to change image file types by allowing you to save image in many different formats. Check this one out if you haven't already. The latest version can be found on MCCC-A 1116.

On MCCC-A\_1122 is CyberTVPlayer, version 5.0a, also by Helmut Hoffmann. If will show animations in the HHsYUVSq format and will work on ANY Amiga (although they won't look nearly as nice as they would on a CyberGraphX setup).

## MCP by ALIENDESIGN

MCP was demonstrated at the July Amiga-By-TheLoop meeting. If you saw the demo, I'm sure you're using the program by now. If you didn't it's time you demo'ed it on your own. MCP should be considered a requirement with any Amiga system. The only system requirements are Workbench 2.04 or greater and MUI - surely everyone is running that setup as a minimum by now. What MCP does is replace all those little system modifier commodities that you probably have running now that do everything from mouse acceleration to screen promotion. There are even a few functions included that I have never seen anywhere else. The version here is 1.11, beta release 10. It's on MCCC-A\_1112.

## RO by Oliver Rummeyer

RO is a file-manager system. This isn't going to replace Directory Opus by any means, but if you don't have Directory Opus, you probably ought to check this out. It's highly configurable and rather simple to operate. The only system requirements are the standard Workbench 2.04 or greater and MUI. You can find it on MCCC-A\_ 1121.

## FastIPrefs by Hans-W. Schober

FastlPrefs is a replacement for the standard system IPrefs program. It can be used on any AGA or CyberGraphX system. The advantage? It runs faster for one thing...the screen displays are quicker. For another, you can specify the precision to be used to display a picture as a Workbench background. When using the standard IPrefs, a 256 color picture is modified on loading so that not all 256 colors are used...even on a 256 color or greater Workbench. Most of the time the difference is minimal, sometimes it's not. With FastIPrefs on a CyberGraphX system, you can set the color mode to "truecolor" and the picture will display the way you expect it to - with no degradation at all. The only requirement for this bit of magic is the v43 picture datatype. FastIPrefs is on MCCC-A\_1125.

## v43 picture datatype by Ralph Schmidt

This is the picture.datatype I just mentioned. Recommended for all CyberGraphX systems, it provides the better color display you want. It will improve the output of such programs as your Workbench with FastIPrefs, and IBrowse so that you can surf the net in style. This is on MCCC-A\_1125 — the same disk that has FastlPrefs.

## Pictures

There are a couple of outstanding JPEG pictures on this month's disks. There's a view of the earth as seen from Apollo 17, and there's a view of both the earth and the moon in a single shot as taken from the Galileo probe. This one is really something to see! Both of these can be found on MCCC-A\_1125.

## DKB RapidFire

A SCSI-II controller review by Aaron Smith he RapidFire is a SCSI-II (not wide or fast) RAM expansion.

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Needs a Zorroll bus only.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Should work with any Amiga from Kickstart 1.3 to 3.x. Requires only the DKB driver software to be installed via floppy. (dkbscsi.device)

## MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

A2000 020, 4MB fast, 2MB chip, 3.1 OS in ROM A3000 40Mhz 040, 32MB fast, 2MB chip, 3.1 in rom.

(2) Comports 8 port serial cards

A4000 25Mhz 040, 48MB ram, 2MB chip, 3.1 in rom.

(1) 4.3 gig Quantum Grand Prix

(1) 1 gig Toshiba

(1) 1 gig IBM OBI drive.

(2) 540MB junker stock IDE drive on 4000 IDE controller.

## INSTALLATION

Installs in any of your 4 or 5 ZorroIl/III slots. It only uses Zorro II though. It slides in a little rough, but fits into the Zorro pins just fine in the end. Unfortunately, at least in my A4000, the back end face plate on the card was too large to screw onto the mounting slot in the back, so it just sits there, still firm enough for very safe use.

The installation of the driver software is very easy - the disk is even bootable. There is no copy util or install script - the programs are just there to use — you can copy them if you want. The software itself wasn't too bad for configuring a drive. The dkbscsi device is internal on the ROM of the card. You can access it via HDToolbox, etc. but it is not on the disk or in devs:. I like it this way.

## REVIEW

The card comes in a Red good-looking box packed into some foam packed around it.

The card itself? My initial view was a bit dissapointing. The card is an utterly simple design. I could have designed this layout myself.

I got it installed in my A4000 and looked to for the small "1" the manual said would be there to show pin 1 of the SCSI 50 pin connector. There was no 1 and the small arrow that was there just didn't register in my head. Now, the other 5 SCSI 1 &amp; 2 controllers I have had over the years have never had a problem if you accidentally installed the cable upside down (in other words, pin 50 on pin 1). The HD activity light just lit up and nothing worked until you reversed the cable. Well, I plugged in my 3 SCSI drives, properly terminated, properly configured, but backwards on the SCSI cable, and turned the power on. I looked down and watched a tracer get white hot and blow right off the card! I was quite mad about this. I couldn't believe that this caused a problem. I have reversed SCSI connectors on my Warp, an A2091, a Fastlane, the 3000 stock controller, and a GVP 040 card without ever having a problem, let alone smoking the card!

Anyway, got the ol' soldering iron out (the card no longer works at this time, of course) and ran a bead of solder over the old trace. Got it working, (whew). I wasn't in the mood to ship this back to DKB the day I got it.

So I reconnected my drives, correctly this time, and tried to boot. The SCSI bus light just lit up and wouldn't shut off. I moved my drives around and SCSI ID's around and it still wouldn't boot. So I had to do it...I forced myself to open the manual and searched for an answer. Here is what I found:

"The RapidFire board uses passive Termination. Some of the newer SCSI drives such as the Quantum Trailblazer series, include an active terminator, which should not be used with the RapidFire. If your drive uses active termination, consult the drive manual for information on how to disable it"

Well, termination was already completely disabled on the drive. I tried EVERY possible config on this SCSI chain over a 3 hour period. This card had no hopes of working with this very widely-sold drive. I called the DKB tech and he told me I could get it working if I took off the termination jumper (which I had done) and that I could get this drive working. He asked if I would like to ship my setup off to him — he thought he could get it working. I decided just to wait for my CyberStorm060 and SCSI module to use my 4.3 gig drive now. I thanked him for his help and gave it another 30 minutes of trying with no luck. I don't think he could have gotten it working either.

My Quantum GrandPrix 4.3 gig drive works great on my Warp SCSI on my 3000, and it even worked GREAT on my A3000 slow OLD scsi bus!

I am now successfully running my IBM and Toshiba drives on the DKB card. I have no choice but to run everything this way because, when I moved my BBS (vrb.com) to an A4000 I lost my 40Mhz 040 3000 Warp and its incredible SCSI speed. The Warp wouldn't boot in my A4000. So, until the CS060/SCSI II is available, I had to find a quick SCSI II solution. I can't wait to get my Warp converted for the 4k or my CS060. I miss my 4.3 gig drive as well as decent speed.

As for RAM, I took 8 MB off my new A4000's motherboard and put it on the card thinking it would have

better memory access than the pitiful A4000 memory bus. The DKB card was very easy to configure - 2 jumpers moved and it was ready for my simms. The jumper config is printed on the card which is a very good idea.

To help with overall speed on my system I went ahead and installed AFSpro and telneted to their support site and got the newest beta of the software. Boy, did this help! AFSpro cut my boot time in half! I now wasn't so distraught about the SCSI performance as I was.

## DOCUMENTATION

It has a 10 page (or so) manual with it. The manual is fair and explains about everything you need to know to get the card running well. Pretty straightforward.

## LIKES

This is a tough one. After what I am used to in SCSI cards, this card is nothing wonderful. I do like the fact that you can mount a very small 3.5" drive on the card itself. This helps out users that don't have room anywhere else in their system.

## DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The card design is so simple it seems like a first project from a high school electronics class. When the card blew a trace I couldn't believe my eyes. The 50 pin connector was so tight I couldn't pull off my cable the first time and ended up gently prying it off with a tiny screwdriver over a 4 minute period. The next 50 pin connector that I crimped onto my cable I oiled with a nonconductive lube. This seemed to help, but not much.

The 2 SIMM sockets where generally fine, but when I installed RAM in them, I wasn't comfortable with the hight in relation to the card above it. The simms were actually touching one of my other cards.

The RAM speed was only 16 bit access (or so I was later told) and was actually slower than the 4000 stock memory, which is SCARY! So I put the 2 4MB simms back on the A4000 motherboard.

The SCSI speed? It is not fast or wide SCSI 2 so it was not much faster than the old stock A3000 speed. I guess the card does its job, but for $149 retail it is a complete joke. A card like this would be a great deal for those low end users needing SCSI if it cost about $60 at most. It must have about $15 worth of OEM parts on it. I have always liked DKB and I am GREATLY looking forward to their new 8 port extremely high-speed serial card to run my internet BBS on, but this card just doesn't do it for me...or anyone. For $60 this would be a great card for some people, but for $150 it could be much better. I hope their super serial/parallel/ethernet card is as much of a Godsend as it sounds like it will be when it ships in late August.

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

It can't compare to my Warp Engine SCSI II. The only other card I have tested with these drives is a A2091 card which is a SCSI I old C= card, the DKB is much faster than it.

## VENDOR SUPPORT

I called DKB to get help with my Quantum drive... well, to get it working with the DKB card that is. At first I was treated like I didn't know a whole lot about drives. Once I comfirmed my abilities with him he was pretty darn nice and tried to be helpful trying to find me some Quantum settings. He couldn't find them, but that was all right. Nothing was going to get this drive working.

## WARRANTY

1 year Warranty. Full repair. Customer pays shipping. Unknown if selling the card transfers warranty.

## CONCLUSIONS

Overall a good product..for 1990. If they would sell the card for around $60 (what is it worth) my review might have been much more favorable.

I know DKB has some serious smart people there. I can't understand why they didn't use just a little bit more brains in the design of this card.

## Browse review... from page 4

Graphics Display: 97%

It does GIF anims and progressive GIFs, in

16,000,000 colours if you have GFX card. Enough said?

HTML 3.2 Support: 98%

Until Netscape adds some more commands to the HTMI standard, IBrowse has 'em all covered (except frames).

Features: 96%

IBrowse is simply dripping with extra goodies everywhere. If the commercial version really does news, mail, gopher, etc. there's not much more you can add.

Overall: 94%

Just download it already, okay?

[Editor's note: I'm not sure who wrote this article, but I agree completely. IBrowse is awesome!!

## VIScorp letter... from page 4

begin to implement the plans we outlined in Toulouse very shortly.

6. Please excuse our lack of communication with the community over the last months. We were severely restricted from communicating our activities. Please resend your emails to any of the VIScorp staff if they have not been answered by this letter. We simply could not answer all the emails.
7. Do not expect miracles from VIScorp. Expect slow, but steady progress.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop

Johnny Kitchens

I decided to give you three for the price of one for my newsletter report on what happened at our chapter's monthly meetings this time. As you will see later it will be announced that these meetings will be the last at the North Richland Hills Community Center. We are moving to what sounds like a very exciting new location at the Bell Helicopter Training Facility. It sounds as if it will better handle our needs for presentations. Something definitely to look forward to for our future meetings.

For the month of May, we had a lot of talk on METCOM, our annual show coming this year on September 28th. Next, a very good discussion on graphic cards for the Amiga started up. Since it has been a while since the Amiga's chipset has seen development work, graphic cards have moved in to pick up where

Commodore left off. There are several to choose from, but the Picasso Il and CyberVision 64 appear to be the winners in most areas. If you want to boost your Amiga and already have an accelerator, then the graphic cards are the next step to consider. A question on the latest news on VisCorp popped up next. At that time we had no news to report.

Someone next asked about a printer driver for the Epson Color

Stylus. If you haven't seen one of these printers in action, give it a shot. The output is fantastic. A great printer driver comes from Endicor in San Antonio. It's the closest thing to a photograph I've seen come out of a sub $300 printer yet! Someone then asked if a motherboard for the 2000 was still available. Several places were suggested. We were asked who were the area dealers. If you haven't been over to Metropolitan in a while, please go over and tell them thanks for sticking with us - and while you are there take a look at the 4000T! Finally, a question on SoftLogik and PageStream came up. Yes, we're still awaiting PageStream 3.1. One bit of news for them is their new website. You can find out what they are doing and the latest news very quickly there.

Finally for the night, Sean Wilson brought out a new package that allows you to connect an Amiga to an IBM compatible computer, allowing the sharing of files and data

With the arrival of June we get several things...high heat, school vacations, work vacations, and news on what to expect in the fall. I just wish there was more news on what to expect in the Amiga world. At least news on 68060 and PowerPC accelerators look promising, with several on the way or promised. The June meeting got started with a reminder on METCOM for September 28th and the new meeting location for the August 13th meeting at the Bell Helicopter Training Facility. This new meeting location is exciting as it will have many features missing from the current location that will allow easier presentations.

between the two. Despite some trouble he still managed to get the basics of its operation over to us. The package is called Link-It, and it allows you to connect Amiga to Amiga, Amiga to PC, and PC to PC.

We also were given the news that the club has BBS only subscriptions available. This will

allow people to join the club in a limited way and give them access to the BBS. Another exciting announcement had to do with Softwood finally getting Final Writer 5 out This product ha: continued to mature at a reasonable rate, and provides the Amiga with an incredible word processor package! This was followed by the sad revelation that Art Department Pro was no more. This empty space has been filled by a couple of other packages, but are

## CHAPTER NEWS

they as complete as Art Department? A question came up on CanDo.. where has it gone? It has shown up a few times in ads from overseas, but is it still being made? Someone next announced that they bought some CD-ROMs with files usable on the Amiga. They had picked them up at the new computer superstore, MicroCenter. This is a very impressive place for computer users. It features so much stuff in one place that it is truly awesome. I found Amiga magazines and books as well there. Our last question was on parts for the mouse. Where could they get some parts?

anything but for 1996. The night of our meeting had plenty of rain and plenty of enthusiasm from those who attended. A combination of weather and sports activities kept attendance down to just 13 people — so few for such a historical night. This will be the last one, as far as we know, at the North Richland Hills Civic Center. Beginning next month we will meet at the previously mentioned Bell Helicopter Training Center. Come join us on August 13th and see how it turns out!

Finally Joe Dwyer brought out his impressive Video Toaster setup. He deserves extra mention just for getting all this stuff up to the second floor of the building. I've seen several different Toaster setups over the years and'they always end up impressing me with their abilities. This one was no exception. Joe kept saying he wasn't very good at this sort of thing, but I'm sure there are many who wish they were nearly as good. Great show!

July brought to us a twist of events. An end to the drought we had

![Image](1996_08_artifacts/image_000003_3c9464b45b63b7161abba383c47cb58497c0a716f44498b276f277057748d3e1.png)

Once again, further discussions on METCOM came up. Classes on how to get on the Internet and what to do once you get there are planned. Because of the topic, lots of questions popped up on the Internet, including what are the best service providers. Several were named by users, each with advantages worth considering. A question on problems with a 2500 came up next. Sounded like the dreaded dying power supply. Someone asked if ImageFX was program worth considering. If you own an Amiga and work with images, YES! A discussion on GVP controllers came up next. Seems that a fairly new product called the GURU-ROM helps keep the controller up to date in many ways. Definitely worth considering.

We then proceeded to a discussion on Amiga news. It appears that VisCorp was close to finalizing the take-over of Amiga Technologies. By the time you read this, the final paper will be signed, and the actual takeover will occur in August. A discussion on the many games available to be played · online on our BBS came up ·. next. Many of us are having 'a-blast with these games.

You're missing out if you haven't joined in.

Finally, David Owens gave us a presentation on the awesome piece of

See you next month at the new location...

software called, simply, MCP. This stands for Master Control Program, and its title certainly is definitive. It can control lots of functions and actions taking place inside your Amiga. This piece of software has so many features that David's printed manual looked like a newsstand magazine. Many people who had not heard of or used MCP were suddenly very interested after seeing it in action. People moved closer to get a better view and questions began flying after seeing a few of its features. I've been using MCP since its introduction and can't imagine my computer without it. It has simplified my computer just by the removal of many programs that have been consolidated into MCP. If you missed the meeting and you haven't looked at MCP yet, take a moment to examine it. And best of all, it's free!

Michael Turner

Our June meeting started out with an interesting surprise. The Community Room at Richardson Square Mall was gone! It had not only moved again but had disappeared altogether! Actually, it turned out that the Community Room had moved again, only this time it had set a personal best in the speed department and thus there was no time for warning. As new stores enter the mall and as old ones leave, the Community Room (being a spare empty room to begin with) rotates around the mall as needed. Eventually, the room was located and our meeting finally came to order. As of this writing, the Community Room is in place near the Montgomery Wards end of the mall next to the Chic-Filet stand. If you are looking for it on the Mall Directory, it is listed as Room 651.

## CHAPTER NEWS

As mentioned before, we have to book the Community Room every three months in advance. Also, as we are competing with Boy Scout Jamborees, non-impact aerobics classes, senior citizen political action committees, and other civic and highminded organizations we sometimes get bumped. Because of this, our next three meetings will be held on the fourth TUESDAY of the month instead of Thursday. Those dates are July 23, August 27 and September 24. Meeting time will be the same (7:30 p.m.).

something not so old) give him a call or a buzz or some e-mail.

Once our room was found and Dan called the meeting to order several members mentioned some technical problems they were having right off the bat. One member mentioned some problems he was having with a GVP hardrive involving reading and writing to the disk even though the computer recognized the drive already upon startup. Another problem involved the A4000 not recognizing certain configurations of extra memory involving SIMM chips.

While this was going on, Eddie passed around several European Amiga magazines. Sometimes those magazines simply have some amazing coverdisks! For the price of a magazine, you can sometimes pick up some great software. One member also printed out VisCorp's latest press releases concerning their purchase of Amiga Technologies. Also, Ned Kelly reminded us of METCOM being held at the Arlington Convention Center on Saturday, Sept. 28th. He also mentioned that, tenatively, there will be two classes held, both on the Internet. One will concentrate on how you hook up to the Internet and the other will concentrate on how you use the Internet and what is out there in Cyberspace. Also, Dan Stockelman is volounteering to collect goods for this year's METCOM flea market, so if you have an old piece of equipment to sell (or even

After all this chit-chat, Steve showed us several of the new CDROMS he had just picked up. One was a collection of more PD games than any ten people could ever play in a lifetime. Some were great, some were good and some were better left alone. Some required two players, some required one player and some played fantastic as long as you didn't annoy the characters by trying to make them do something. Another was the archive of Eric Schwartz animations that is available. That one kept us entertained for quite a while. After these two goodies, Eddie good-naturedly took us through his system so we could see how he set his system up using ARexx and Directory Opus.

About this time our local mall security agent through highly suggestive body language and colorful local-mall-security-agent euphemisms enlightened us to the fact that it was getting late and perhaps it was time to pick up and "head on home." This we did. Anyway, we'll do it all again next month. See Ya There!

## Metro C64/128 Mary Louise Hagemeyer

At our recent meetings we've discussed how to use the Internet, what terminal programs are best, and generally how we can use our 8-bit machines. A first-time visitor in June wanted to get on StarText.net with her C128 after learning she could get it free with her 6-month subscription to the Star Telegram. This led to a discussion of modem speeds and the agreement that 300 baud is obsolete but 1200 would suffice for E-mail.

Mike and Brenda Sessums distributed their excellent newsletter, Metro C-64/128 Commodore News, and it would be nice if we could just print all of it in this space. Noteworthy items include the announcement of the release of Novaterm 9.6, which offers powerful new features for Commodore users of the Internet or other BBS systems. The new Novaterm will be available on disk, not on cartridge as had been previously announced

Jack Tarvin found a bug in the genealogy program from C64 Alive. It wouldn't accept a person's birth date, which is a serious flow in such a program. We didn't have another copy of the disk at the meeting, but the problem needs to be investigated.

Thanks to Commodore Country for donating a door prize for the May meeting, The Fun Graphics Machine, won by Jack Hagemeyer.

METCOM will be a little early this year - September 28 - so it's time to gather up those computerrelated items that have been collecting dust and bring them to the August meeting for sale at the flea market.
