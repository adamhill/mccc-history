## Defining an Amigan

what makes us stick with it? by Guy Nathan

Y ou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one." The Amiga's return can be compared to this line from a famous song. Many said the Amiga couldn't survive Commodore's demise, but through it all Amiga users kept believing, having faith, in something which was much more to them than the average PC. It has been said only the Amiga could've died and come back'again, any other platforms would have merely died off all together. And this feeling has been echoed by Amiga users, corporations which support the Amiga, and industry critics themselves. So on this return of the Amiga, I will attempt to define an Amigan.

Those of you who have kept up with Amigas over the years, who have read magazines, participated in Amiga Computer user support groups, participated in mail echos such as comp.sys.amiga areas on the internet, and Amiga related echos through Fidonet and Amiganet, will know most likely of the sort of feeling certain Amiga users have about their machine. In this article I will discuss some of these feelings expressed in the things mentioned above, and other matters which I believe help to define an Amigan.

As a bit of background, I will start off by first discussing what the Amiga was designed to be. The Amiga was designed to be the Ultimate Game Machine, and was developed and built by a dedicated bunch of computer experts in 1982-5 who wanted to make a machine which people would think of as something they would be proud to own. The bunch of experts were made up of people such as R.J. Mical and Jay Miner (RIP), who designed part of the Amigas custom chipset, and who is known to many as the "father" of the Amiga. Due to a lack of funds originally supplied by a trio of doctors, the development company could no longer afford to continue development without the aid of being bought out by a larger company. To make a long story short as to who bought what, when, and where the company which ended up with it in the end is as many of you know was

Commodore. When Commodore got hold of it, they changed several aspects of the machine, and introduced a Disk Operating System based on Tripos. This was coded by Bristol-based Metacomco, a company which only prior to that had developed for mainframes. This helped the machine to change from a purely games machine to a proper personal computer. Since the A1000's release there have been subsequent releases of newer, "better" and faster Amigas. HAM mode found in Amiga's wasn't supposed to have existed, and Jay was going to remove it, but at the last minute he changed his mind (due to external influences) and kept it.

The best way to characterize an Amigan, is probably to meet one yourself and talk about their feelings about the Amiga PC. An Amigan is a computer user who has an above average knowledge about computers in general, as opposed to your average Mac and PC user who buy a computer because it has the label "Multimedia" on it, or "Free 5 hours user of the Information Superhighway." An Amigan, is generally a person who is not afraid to explore the limits of their machine and try to take it one step further. They are innovative, creative, well opinionated, and many things more. The average PC or Mac user, when they run into a problem, will generally ring a company for support to come in and fix it, where as an Amigan will usually solve the problem themselves in a small amount of time, and continue going on whatever they were doing prior to it.

Those of you who have read Amiga magazines and participated in Amiga mail areas, will be all too familiar with Amiga vs X Machine debates. An Amigan is the type of person who is not afraid to speak out in a crowd of PC and Mac "experts," and voice their opinion in regards to the Amiga vs PCs and Macs. They are generally well equipped with facts and other related information about the Amiga and machines on other platforms, whether it be information on a Pentium ™ , a Mac Quadra™. , or even a PowerPC. There is a real 'flame' in an Amigan's heart to defend their machine through thick and thin, and not falling for the sheep syndrome when times are tough. The real test for Amigans has been the demise of Commodore. The Amiga gameplayers (not to be mistaken at all with Amigans), were the first to go, and went off and jumped platforms. Other non-dedicated Amiga users went next, attracted by the likes of Doom I and II, Excel, and Word 6/7, even though chances are, they wouldn't use any more features than on their Amiga counterpart software which is also far cheaper. Other people who were real Amigans unfortunately had to leave for other platforms, not by choice but due to financial and job matters.

ESCOM'smbuyout of Commodore International ™ , and the formation of ESCOM's "Amiga Technologies" division. Opinions on what they can provide the Amiga with has been heavily disputed and left some Amigans rather heartbroken at the thought of it. As a result of this, in very recent times these people have jumped platforms as well, but being Amigans, as they still are, they have kept their

The most recent test for Amigans has been lot of Amiga authors do it for the love of their machine, gaining no profit whatsoever, but maybe some fame. It is this sort of dedication, willingness to provide something for nothing, that makes an Amigan. The programs which are shareware are usually products which are of commercial standard, but at a non-commercial price. On the PC, I have found that many applications which are freely distributable on the Amiga come at a great expense on the PC (eg. Screenblankers, general purpose utilities, etc.).

Amigans know that although initial costs of hardware for their machine far outweighs that of the existing competition, when it comes down to buying

...words alone can't describe the feelings involved here. Is it Magic? Who knows? Amiga Tech's new "Amiga Magic" pack may be a good way to describe the Amiga - Magic.

Amigas for use, whenever they feel like it. Amigans who jump platforms are usually the smartest of the PC and Mac users around.

Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting up with an Amigan who was one of the first Amiga owners in the world (the Amiga was purchased from the first batch of Amiga 1000's to ever hit Australia), and was also one of the very first Amiga Developers here in Australia. He told me of the experiences he had with meeting Jay Miner, and other famous people in the Amiga's history, with much joy and enthusiasm as if it were only yesterday, praising these people who put the "heart" in the Amiga. After meeting with him I felt a link to them in a way, like a family, ethnic community, race, or religious link because they were other Amigans. An Amigan is not determined by race, religion, or anything else like that, but by one's feelings towards a machine which makes you think it really has a heart, and you're ready to defend that machine against all odds. In magazines you read of people who say, "I have an Amiga but my friends have bought PCs. I tell them the Amiga is a better machine and they say 'Ha! That crappy thing?? It can't do anything but play some really old games. It doesn't even have Doom!' But I know I'm right when I say my Amiga will provide me with much more enjoyment than their PC will ever." It is this dedication which makes an Amigan.

Those who have noticed the number of programs on the Amiga which are freely distributable, will know that a the costs would be significantly higher. The Amiga is STILL the cheapest low-cost, true-multimedia, truemultitasking machine with an OS which isn't system resource heavy.

applications after purchasing their machine, the Amiga user usually comes out fairly OK. For example, the price of Final Writer 4 or Word Worth 4, if they were PC only applications would cost the user many times more than what is currently charged. And although some Amiga users complain that software is too expensive, they would find if they were after the equivalent on a competing platform

Before I go on though, it must be said that words alone can't describe the feelings involved here. Is it Magic? Who knows? Amiga Tech's new "Amiga Magic" pack may be a good way to describe the Amiga - Magic.

Some of us Amigans are stupid, actually we almost → Page 5

The announcement of a PPC (PowerPC) Amiga has left some unsure whether this will be just another jazzed up "Multimedia" (note quotes) PowerPC or a real Amiga with a big step-up in the processing power department and probably in the graphics department too. I don't believe I can judge whether an Amigan can be determined by which one of the above two they choose to believe. But with Vapourware, something founded by Commodore, Amiga users have over time become more skeptical about 'promises' made, and things to be released 'real soon' which change into being released days, months, years later, or maybe in the end, never. Whatever happens, the release of upgrades for our Amigas are more than welcome, as people's patience fades more and more for the Amiga to be able to come once again up to scratch against the competition, or to once again be innovative and do for the Computer industry again what it did back in '85. I believe all Amigans would support this idea.

## LIST PRICE

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Officially this module is for the desktop A4000 only, but there have keen reports that it can be made to fit in the A3000 and A4000T. I personally can't vouch for this.

## MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

A4000 — originally fitted with a 25MHz 68ec030/68882 module

2MB Chip RAM, 16MB Expansion RAM Kickstart 3.0, Workbench 3.0 124MB Seagate IDE Hard Drive

410MB Samsung IDE Hard Drive

Ouch!

## INSTALLATION

This is NOT, repeat NOT, an easy piece of hardware to fit. I'm not going to give a step-by-step walk-through of how to fit it, because a) the documentation provided with the module does it rather well, and b) if you really need a step-by-step guide, then you'd be better off getting your dealer to fit the thing for you. I'm warning you, this is a right pain in the backside to fit.

Assuming you want to do it yourself, I'll just point out firstly what the overall installation is like, and also where I think the documentation could be improved a little.

Fitting a CPU module to the A4000 is about the hardest upgrade you can do to the machine, short of replacing the motherboard. What makes it harder is that the Cyberstorm is not a single daughterboard, but consists of a carrier board, roughly the same size as the original CPU board, a memory board and the all important CPU board. Fitting the carrier board is quite easy, as is the memory board. However, the CPU board is the most frightening piece of the installation since, in order to get it sitting correctly on its mounting clips, you have to apply quite a bit of pressure to the board, and since, in doing so you are also applying pressure to the carrier board, this flexes alarmingly. Also complicating the issue is that you are made painfully (literally) aware of the sharp edges/points on the rear of the Zorro backplane. One small slip of the fingers and you may end up with a shredded hand...

So, how can you make it easier on yourself?

1. The manual recommends removing the rear drive bay, but says nothing about the front bay. Indeed, all the photos in the manual show the front bay in place. I'd recommend removing it, since it gives you more space to manoeuvre.

2. The problem described above with the carrier board flexing is due to the stiffness of the clips on the spacer legs used to hold the CPU card in place on the carrier board. A way to ease the problem is to file the edges of the clips slightly, to reduce the width ever so slightly, making it easier to get the clips in place. Don't overdo it though, otherwise there'll be no point in having the clips at all! Aside from those two points, just follow the manual and you should be fine.

## REVIEW

I'll start by saying that the pain of the installation was easily worth it, because having the fastest CPU in the 68000 family sitting inside my Amiga makes me VERY happy. If you are in any way interested in processor intensive work, like image processing, 3D rendering, document processing or 3D games(!), you should really consider the 68060 as a serious upgrade option. This is especially true if, like me, your A4000 is currently powered by a 68030. For 4000/040 owners the choice may not be quite so clear, since they have the option of buying a bare Cyberstorm 040 and using their existing 68040 on that. Although a 25MHz 68040 is roughly half as fast as a 50MHz 68060, the extra cost of the 060 card over the 040 version may be more important. For 68030 owners though, the small extra cost between a 68040 card and the Cyberstorm 060 is easily offset by the extra speed gain.

The hardware itself looks very well made, and all fits together firmly. I guess the only thing I could complain about is the decidedly cheap method of isolating the RAM module from the Zorro backplane. You might think that Phase 5 would have fitted the module with an insulated cover but no, they instead provide a sheet of cardboard for you to bend into shape and position between the memory module and backplane. Whilst this is effective, it seems so amateurish when you consider the quality (and cost) of the hardware. As for the software,

what you get is as follows:

- 68040.library
- 68060 library
- CPU060 — a replacement for the Shell CPU command
- CyberPatcher — patches some programs that use floating point operations not handled by the onboard FPU, to speed things up
- CyberSnooper — reports any use of a floating point instruction that has to be emulated by the CPU. Useful for software developers
- CyberGuard — an Enforcer clone, specifically for the 68060. You'll still need Enforcer for its documentation
- BarFly — Shareware version of the BarFly assemblerdebugger utility. Would have been nice to have gotten the registered version, but we can't have everything.

So, the big question is, just how much faster is everything??? This is not an easy question to answer, simply because any speed increase is highly dependent on the rest of the system. What I've done is time a few operations carried out using popular utilities, both with the 25MHz 68030/882 combination and with the 50MHz 68060. The 68030 time/rating is shown first. Here goes!

- Final Writer 4: Printing a large EPS image at 360*360dpi to a Preferences printer: 6m10s / 1m49s
- Post 1.86enh: Printing the same image as above, at 360*360dpi to the same printer: 1m57s / Om19s
- AMOS 3D: A starfield plotting program: 4.2 frames per second / 24.5 frames per second
- AMOS Professional: A map generator — time to create one map: 1m07s / 0m09s
- ImageFX 1.52.1346 (CUAmiga coverdisk version): (All tests carried out on a 640*512 24 bit buffer)

5*5 convolve - 1m16s / 0m06s

90 degree rotate - 16s / 2s

Save as Q85 JPEG to RAM — 18s / 2s

Load resultant JPEG from RAM - 10s / 2s

- Brilliance 2 — Registered version: To load a 640*512 HAM-8 image and convert to 256 colours: 2m42s / 0m27s. To perform a full screen negative on the resultant image: 17s / 7s
- Imagine 2: To render a particular scene at 80*64, 24 bit Trace mode: 4m47s / 0m30s
- LhA 1.38: Compress entire Sys: partition to RAM: 6m50s / 1m45s. Test resultant archive: 1m21s / 0m32s

A bit of simple maths shows a range of speed increases from the 2.4 mark (Brilliance 2 negative) up to 12.6 (ImageFX convolve). It can be concluded then that, from the raw processor speed point of view, an A4000/060 is 12 times faster than a standard A4000/030. However, the rest of the A4000 has not been accelerated by this factor, leading to the apparently disappointing results from, say, Brilliance. Given that Brilliance relies heavily on the graphics hardware, and was designed to be as fast as possible on a low-end Amiga, it is no surprise that the bottleneck here is the AGA hardware rather than the processor. Similarly, the various loading/saving tests show that the 060 can be kept waiting for the slow IDE hard drives. Maybe my next upgrade will be the CyberSCSI module and a nice fast SCSI drive to go with it.

As far as compatibility goes, in the short time I've been using the 060, I've yet to find a program that cannot be persuaded to work. Certainly all the serious utils I use regularly work just fine, as do my current set of regularly played games. Aside from one case where I'm required to boot without running SetPatch, the worst degrading that's been found necessary is to turn off the 060 data cache, which is easily done using the provided CPU060 utility.

Put it this way...if a program works on a standard A4000 it's a miracle, so getting it to work on an A4000/060 is a relatively simple task. (Nothing against the A4000, just the programmers who assume that the A1200 is the only AGA machine there is, forgetting that the A4000 does some things ever so slightly differently).

## DOCUMENTATION

A 32 page bilingual (German/English) A4 manual, with lots of clear pictures of the installation process, and diagrams showing the location and settings for all the jumpers. I like the photos showing each step of the installation, just to make things absolutely clear, and the clear instructions on jumper settings. However, I've read the section on fitting SIMMs to the memory module a few times, and I am sure that the description of the SIMM orientation is wrong, although the accompanying photo is correct.

On-disk documentation is provided for most of the software, though as I mentioned earlier, you'll need to get hold of the original Enforcer documentation if you want to use CyberGuard, since the supplied docs only cover the (minimal) differences between the two. Unfortunately no documentation is provided for CPU060, which is a shame since I'm not 100% sure what all the different CPU options mean/do. Sure, I know what a data cache is, and I can have a good guess as to the function of the branch prediction cache, but what the heck is AllocateOperand mode??? Some information on the 68060 would therefore have been appreciated.

## LIKES

It's the fastest accelerator for the Amiga, it's nicely made and it comes in a rather mean and sinister looking black box.

## DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The cardboard insulator for the Zorro backplane is out of place in such a high profile product, and really should be replaced with a properly applied insulation layer on the memory module. Perhaps we should have been given the registered version of BarFly, or a reduced registration fee.

The manual section detailing the fitting of SIMMs to

the memory module could de with being re-written (or perhaps re-translating, it may be that something was lost/altered from the original German version). There needs to be some documentation about the 68060 itself, detailing what all the caches etc. do, and possibly some examples of when you should turn options on and off to maintain backward compatibility.

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

Compared to the 68030/882, the 68060 screams along. You want raw CPU muscle, you got it!

## BUGS

Just the bugs in the manual.

## VENDOR SUPPORT

Unknown.

## WARRANTY

"Phase 5 Digital Products provides the REGISTERED USER of this Cyberstorm Accelerator with a 12 month parts and labour guarantee, commencing on the date of purchase. During the period of the guarantee we will remedy all defects either by exchange or repair, at our discretion, which are due to material or manufacturers defects. Execution of the rights under this guarantee in no way affects the period of the guarantee."

## CONCLUSIONS

Because of the few minor quibbles I have, I can't give the Cyberstorm 060 a 5/5, but I will give it a 4.99999/5. If you need the fastest 68000 based Amiga, you need the Cyberstorm, it's as simple as that.

Finally, given the quality of Phase 5 products, I'm more than happy to see them working so closely with Amiga Technologies on new Amiga hardware. It can only be good for the Amiga's future.

## Amigans defined from page 2

all are! Why? Because we defy Economics, defy Business logic, defy Industry standards, defy common sense, and more. But especially the fact we spend more on our machines to turn them into powerful beasts, than Mr/Ms/etc average PC owner would. We spend amounts on accelerators which would buy us much faster PC CPUs. We spend amounts on graphics cards which are a fraction of the price on PCs. We spend more for hardware especially made for the Amiga when cheap clones exist which can do more for less cost on the PC. PC owners can buy their PCs for less than we spend on getting a 060 upgrade CPU for our Amigas.

still don't come up to scratch in many areas. Their multitasking is still far from perfect, although their "pseudo" multitasking in Win95 is noticeably improved. Above all, PCs are still limited by their XT-originated architecture, something that with all the marvels of modern PC technologies, they still have not totally overcome. An Amigan recognizes this, and as a result sticks with a machine which still truly does most of what they want, and can run Shapeshifter to do things it doesn't.

But all costs aside, all dollars/pounds/etc. spent, PCs

It is without argument though, the PC has way more 'flashier' games nowadays (not necessarily better), with their 'cOol' interactive movies (ie. spot the section where you actually get to make a decision what to do next and watch the pretty sequences), and the like, and obviously a lot more games are released for this 'Business' platform than on our humble Amigas. But despite this, Amigans still keep their machines, and some have gone out and bought a Next Gen console for the purposes of playing those 'cOOl' games found on the PC, and the rest of us have generally been happy with our Colonizations, Pinball Illusions, Fears, our Gloom, our Alien Breed 3D's, our Lemmings, and so on.

But when it comes down to defining an Amigan, in reality I can't. Neither can any other article attempt to. What I have given you here is a bit of an insight into what I believe might constitute an Amigan vs anyone else. Feel free to discuss this on c.s.a. if you wish, debate over it, whatever. Hopefully we'll see some responses to this in the letters to the Ed section in future issues of Amiga Report (or any other place this article may appear).

Amigans live in a world dominated by PCs, Macs, UNIX Boxes, and so on. We don't have as many magazines as other platforms do, we don't have as much support by companies as other platforms do, so what do we have? We have Amigas, we have magazines dedicated to our machines. We have a general ignorance about our machine in the general public - okay, so we don't have it all — but what counts is that we've stuck by this wonder of a machine, and still care about it just as much. Ignoring what the competition has is just ignorance. Once you have learned about the competition you can then go and say how bad it is.

## Super64

## a new product coming from CMD from the Lansing Area Commodore Club

ou all know who CMD is, right? Well, those people that brought us JiffyDOs ten years ago are at it again. CMD has formally announced that they will be producing what is to be called Super64/10 and Super64/20. These are accelerators for the 64 in the form of a plug-in cartridge and are designed to make the 64 run up to 20 times faster. The Super64/10 contains a processor that is rated at 10mhz while the Super64/20 includes, you guessed it, a 20mhz processor.

CMD has put some very good thinking into this new device. It is rather compact and plugs directly into the expansion port. The Super64 also includes a pass-through port so that an additional device may still be plugged in such as a 1750 REU.

One of CMD's main objectives was compatibility with their existing product line. After plugging in the Super64, a RamLink may still be plugged into the Super64's pass-through port. The Super64 will recognize the presence of the RamLink thereby allowing its usage. CMD states that a RamLink ROM will actually be installed insider the Super64 to make this happen. This will be an incredible breakthrough for 64 users that have RamLinks. They will not only have fast data access with the RamLink, buy will have incredible processing speed with the Super64.

The design of Super64 at this point includes 2 switches on the case. These are 3-position switches. One switch will control the speed of the unit. In one position, for compatibility with certain programs that will fail to run, the machine will run at its standard mhz mode and it will be locked in at that speed. In another position, the speed will be locked in at 10 or 20 mhz depending on the model, while the third position will allow software to control the speed. The reason software might need to control the speed is for operations such as serial port access which requires the speed to come down to that which is supported by the existing serial devices. The second switch will be a disable switch. The first position will disable the unit altogether. The second position will enable it, while the third position will also enable it and switch on JiffyDOS.

You can probably guess by now that this unit will have its own operating system. When the accelerator is in operation, it is more or less in control of the 64. Much of the actual processing is taking place inside of the Super64, and it also contains its own 64k of fast RAM and its own ROM which holds the operating system.

To give you a comparison with an IBM type machine... In terms of actual raw processing power, the Super64 will compare to a 386 running at 25mhz. Now, take into account that much of the software that is written for IBM type machines is not written very compactly. Whereas, with the 64's limitation on memory, programs must be written with considerably more thought and efficiency. This makes for faster programs. So, with that in mind, a 20mhz Super64 equipped 64 will perform much like a 486 running at between 50-66mhz. Hold onto your socks.

CMD plans to have the Super64 accelerators ready for shipment in February of '96. Development is still taking place and according to sources is right on schedule. Pre-production units for software developers will be ready about the second week of December.

The prices for the two units will be $149.95 for the 10mhz model and $199.95 for the 20mhz model. For serious 64 users, and especially serious GEOS users, this will be money well spent.

What about the 128 users? CMD is introducing the 64 unit first. It will also work on a 128, but only in 64 mode. A version specifically for the 128 is being planned and most likely will be available eventually. The accelerator for the 64 does not require anywhere near the amount of time or money that would be involved in developing an accelerator for the 128. The 128 is a much more complex machine and in its own right, quite a marvel.

Supposedly, one of the biggest reasons that Commodore ceased production of the 128 was because they could build an Amiga 500 for less money and sell it for more money. At the time the 64 was still selling, so the decision to halt production of the 128 was made. However, a great deal of 128s hit the market and the 128 has a very devoted following, perhaps as much or more so than the 64. It would be surprising if CMD does not produce an accelerator for the 128 after they introduce the 64 model. Just imagine a 128 running at 20 or 30 mhz. Also, expect to see some additional special features included with the 128 accelerator. There are a lot of special things that CMD can do with this unit if the demand is there.

In the meantime, programs like geoPublish will be so productive that there will be no reason for a 64 user to want anything else. There will be very little wait while GeoWrite is scrolling text on your screen. If you use GeoCalc for your spreadsheets, you probably won't even detect when it is calculating the cells.

## OS Beers

## From The Internet Contributed by Bruce Nelson (original author unknown)

I operating systems Wers Hers DOS Beer: Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately. Soon to be discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it after it's no longer available.

Mac Beer: At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by many to be a "light" beer. All the cans look identical. When you take one from the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call to ask about the ingredients, you are told that "you don't need to know." A notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan.

Windows 3.1 Beer: The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will explode when you open it.

OS/2 Beer: Comes in a 32-oz. can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously too, but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open them, even if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs have been sold.

Windows 95 Beer: The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have 16-oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks just like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the company promises to change the can to look just like Windows 95 Beer's - after Windows 95 Beer starts shipping. Touted as an "industrial strength" beer, and suggested only for use in bars.

Unix Beer: Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8-oz. to 64-oz. Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years.

AmigaDOS Beer: The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans, too. When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for

drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.

Windows NT Beer: Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes most people to have watching TV anyway.

VMS Beer: Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the to p a n d sipping. However, cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely un-beer like contents. Best drunk in high pressure development environments. When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients, you're told that is proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA. Rumors are that this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke lipart and pictures. If that's interesting to you, then this is your month. For a small preview, all of the clipart and pictures used in this month's newsletter are from this month's club disks. There are a couple of clipart collections. Some are in IFF format. Others are in EPS format. All of them are high quality and well worth adding to your collection. You'll find them on MCCC-A\_ 1038, 1039, 1040 and 1041.

The digitized pictures this month are of the swimsuit variety. Kathy Ireland, Ellie MacPherson, Cindy Crawford and Sandra Bullock are all featured in a rather large collection. These pics are of excellent quality and well worth checking out. You'll find these on MCCC-A\_1041, 1042, 1043, 1044 and 1048.

For Eric Schwartz fans, there is a collection of his artwork to be found on MCCC-A \_ 1045, 1046, 1047 and 1048. Lots of Amy and Clairise pics in 256 colors. Once again, these are of excellent quality...but then, Eric Schwartz pictures always are.

But, truth is, that's not quite all that's worth having this month. There's a very nice screen promotion utility to be found on MCCC-A\_1042. It's called NewMode and it's by Andreas Linnemann. The program sits in the background and pops up a requester when a program gets ready to open a new screen. When that happens, you select the screen that you want it to run on and continue on your way. You can save the setting if you like so you'll only see the requester once for each program in your system.

For all you MUI users (and I think at this point Magic User Interface is probably a system requirement), there's a new version, 3.3, available on MCCC-A\_1044. Time to upgrade. /

February provides Texas with some interesting weather on a regular basis. It seems that if it's going to snow, February will be the month to provide it. It also seems to be a sure thing for grass fires. It also guarantees us the shortest month even when it is given an extra day!

individual discussions and hands-on demonstrations. All in all, a great save for a night missing something! One thing was obvious from tonight — we need an Internet get-together, and we need it soon! Probably will be the biggest get-together we could have! What do you think?

This month, as usual, David Owens brought the meeting to attention, to let us know that the main presenter was missing. We proceeded onward with the usual meeting fun things we seem to always enjoy. A member associated with GTE told us of a new high-speed connection service being worked on. Sounds like moving information through the phone line is high on their priorities. Because tonight was to deal with the Internet, lots of people came prepared with questions on just that subject. Questions on the Internet, how to get set up, and AmiTCP dominated the meeting for about 40 minutes. We then heard from a member who knew a small newsletter publisher in Southlake that needed help with their dead Amiga. Seems they publish a small info paper, using an Amiga, and their computer had died a sudden death.

March can be looked upon as a month to bring about new things. It brings us warmer weather, Spring, and it's usually the time of the year for new computer equipment. For David Owens it meant a new baby boy! Congratulations David! Be sure he knows what kind of computer to use.

Tonight brought into focus another thing that is happening practically everywhere you look in the Metroplex. Traffic jams! I was brought to a crawl shortly after getting onto the Airport Freeway, just a few miles west of 360. I continued this pace 'til I exited onto Loop 820. I never saw the source of this slow down. This is starting to be a regular event on this stretch of road, which is bad when you consider I use it no more than two times a month. Everywhere you look, they are working on this problem. They call it "road improvement." By the time they finish it, it's out of date. 50 minutes to travel 15 miles is a bit ridiculous!

Due to the previously mentioned event, David was absent,

We then returned to the subject of the Internet... Web Browsers this time. Seems there are several, with AMosaic being the best known. IBrowser has been getting some talk lately, showing up in one Amiga magazine even. Better yet, Amiga Technologies is very close to releasing its own Internet setup, Amiga Surfer. With the problems of setting up AMosaic intimidating many users, easy setup has been the main calling cards of the other two. Amiga Surfer also adds a surprise with its use of shareware programs for many of the support programs. With that, we gave away some door prizes and finished up the night with so the meeting was put into motion by Wayne Brodnax, our VicePresident. His first big statement of the night was a plea for demos for the meetings. This is something we need bad. If you can help, please come forward. Some interesting news was passed around next. The creator of term was hired by Amiga Technologies to work on some important software. Soft Logik has released PageStream 3.0i, which has already showed up on the club BBS! A person asked about a nagging problem occurring on their 1200. Another had a question on ProPage 3. A question on replacing the battery in the 4000 made the rounds again tonight. Seems the battery leakage scare is still with us! A problem with Workbench patterns was discussed next. Someone complained about the operation of the BBS, believing it had a problem. Okley Moss, our BBS operator, assured us that all was working fine. If you've noticed a difference in performance between line 1 and line 2 of the BBS, or you have trouble connecting, I found part of the problem. Line 1 has a V.FC modem while line 2 is a V.34 modem. Both are capable of 28800, they just go about it in different ways by using different standards. Finally, it appears that Amiga Surfer is finally ready and should be shipping by the time you read this.

Tonight, Bill Raecke brought forth his highly optimized 2500 to present Final Cale. This piece of software comes from Softwood, the creators of Final Writer. Final Cale gives the Amiga an easy to use spreadsheet that has many advanced features missing from the Amiga in other packages. With Bill's complete overview of the package, Im sure that quite a few at the meeting knew exactly what to ask for should they find themselves needing such a software package.

according to the Jan-Feb edition of The Underground.

Do you miss those games you used to run on your Commodore 64? Then just get yourself a Pentium with CD-ROM and buy Activision's C64 game pack on CD! Or maybe you just want to speed up the computer you already have. Creative Micro Designs is introducing the Super CPU 64/20 Accelerator which will give 20 mHz speed to a C64. This is due in April at a price under $200.. and the subsequent C128 version will sell for under $300. Brenda Sessums told us about this, as well as the WAVE, a Web browser for a C128 with 64K of video RAM. A demo version has been released

One correction to the January article: we mistakenly placed Bernie Wilson in Benbrook, when he actually is a COPS volunteer in Meadowbrook. Bernie has added graphs from Abacus Chartpak to his program for interesting police reports.

Many thanks to our friends at Commodore Country who generously donate software and other goodies for our door prizes.
