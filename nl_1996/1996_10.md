## What's Next?

VisCorp, phase 5, or PIOS? competing amiga platforms?

he deadline for the completion of the sale of Amiga Technologies to VisCorp is past. The deal was supposed to be completed no later than September 30. If that happened, it's sure been a well-kept secret. My guess is it didn't happen. At this point we all have to wonder if it ever will. But... that doesn't mean that the Amiga is dead. As a matter of fact, in some ways it seems more alive now than it ever has. That's because there are now a number of companies interested in developing computers using the AmigaOS as a model for new and better computers. Back in June, this newsletter featured an article about phase 5's plans to develop a PowerPCbased computer with a new operating system that would be compatible with existing Amiga systems. So far as I am aware, those plans are still on track and phase 5 is expecting to roll out their new machine in the first half of 1997. Phase 5 is a company experienced in providing Amiga software and hardware and there's no reason to think their new Amiga-compatible won't be a winner.

Now there's another player to talk about. PIOS Computer, A.G. is a new, small computer company formed by and consisting of a group of people closely associated with the Amiga. They are planning to develop their own Amiga-compatible OS to run on a PowerPC platform. Considering the fact that their staff consists of people like Dave Haynie, Andy Finkel and Dr. Peter Kittel, there is plenty of reason to think that this project will be another , success.

This could get interesting! It seems that even Commodore's monumental mishandling of the Amiga platform can't kill it. There are now no less than three companies working to pick up the market. Stay tuned for further developments. In the meantime, here's an introduction to PIOS Computer, A.G.

...Bill Raecke

The PIOS Strategy

The mission of PIOS is to become a reasonable player in the market for consumer computer products.

The goal is to reach an overall market share in all countries PIOS goes into of 10 percent until the year 2000. PIOS as a company follows the strategy of developing and marketing PowerPC-based architectures, in strong competition to the Windows/Intel monopoly.

This includes the development and distribution of a native operating system, which will be recognized by the market as the next generation of the former AMIGA OS 3.1. To provide a preemptive multitasking OS with quasi-realtime behavior will be the biggest advantage of PIOS.

PIOS recognizes its position as a start-up-company: small staff, small costs, small overhead. PIOS is heavily dependent on a good working relationship to its customers, vendors, design partners, employees, and shareholders. PIOS wants to become big in competence, sales, market-share, and shareholder-value.

## Next Generation Hardware Statement by Dave Haynie

Our general hardware philosophy at PIOS is simple: we will work to bring back Amiga compatible hardware that restores the price/performance factors and user confidence that will allow the Amiga's successful reintroduction.

Along with that, we want to bring back the excitement Amiga systems once generated. In keeping with tradition, a powerful low-end system is one initial target. We believe that a careful hardware design coupled with the economies of the AmigaOS, and its superior handling of multimedia related issues, can deliver a new class of home computer at a price that Wintel systems can't match.

While price is critical here, we expect to deliver powerful, modern systems that play great games, network easily, and offer productivity and multimedia performance heretofore only available in high-end systems.

Above a certain price point, we expect to build systems that follow the existing industry standards for PowerPC system compatibility. Integrating Power

New Zealand and South Africa. In all these countries he will represent the company in every respect, including press and software contacts.

PC Platform conventions (PPCP&gt; offers the user a choice of operating systems, making PIOS systems a sound investment even when the AmigaOS is the primary OS of choice. Use of standard hardware components such as JDEC memory modules, IDE and SCSI peripherals, PCI bus expansion cards, and very probably a number of new emerging standards, helps keep hardware costs down, thanks to industry-wide economies of scale. This lets us provide a better initial system value and it makes such systems easier and cheaper to upgrade or customize once in user's hands. '

## Miami vs TermiteTCP

the two latest TCP/IP programs compared review by Ron Mascaro of the ABCUG

onnecting an Amiga to the Internet has, unti difficulties of installing and configuring a TCP/IP stack, the software that allows the Amiga to communicate with other computers via the common language (protocol) of the Internet. The only available TCP/IP stacks for the Amiga were AmiTCP and AS225 (or Inet225, as it is known in its commercial incarnation). AmiTCP is somewhat difficult to set up, even for a net Guru. For the beginner, it is a nightmare. There is no GUI. To change any of the configuration settings, you had to run the install script over again. Additionally, AmiTCP did not directly support dial-up connections. You either had to dial the provider from a terminal program, set the modem to stay online, release the serial port and then run AmiTCP, or you had to install one of the shareware GUI front-ends to do this for you. In all fairness, the latest commercial version of AmiTCP is supposed to have a rudimentary dialer, but I haven't had the opportunity to use it. I've never had the opportunity to try out AS225 or Inet255, so I don't know how difficult they are to use.

Added to the installation difficulties is the fact that AmiTCP and AS225 use different Application Programming Interfaces (APL) the language that the Client programs, such as FTP, use to communicate with the TCP/IP stack. Clients written for AmiTCP would not work with AS225 and vice-versa. In the past year or so, libraries have been available to allow Clients to work with either stack transparently. Still, the Amiga desperately needed a TCP/IP stack that was simple to use.

All that has changed with the recent introduction of two new TCP/IP stacks for the Amiga, Miami and TermiteTCP. Miami is a shareware program that currently is only available from the author's WWW and FTP sites. TermiteTCP is a commercial program published by Oregon Research. Both of these programs were designed specifically for dial-up connections with ease of use a primary consideration. The focus of this review is to compare these two programs.

First off, let me say that Miami and TermiteTCP are not suitable for direct LAN connections. Neither has any support of Amiga ethernet cards. Both programs are limited to dial-up connections only, although Holger ·Kruse, the author of Miami, has hinted that he may produce a Miami Professional version if there is enough interest. However, both programs have settings for use with a null modem cable to connect two Amigas directly via the serial ports.

The Interface: Miami uses the MUI GUI system. TermiteTCP uses the standard Amiga GUI. MUI is highly user configurable, but window redraws are a somewhat slower, especially on high color AGA screens. If you are using a 4 or 8 color screen or a graphics card, you will get much better performance. Both programs use the GUI exclusively for all configuration and connections operations. There are no text files to edit.

Installation: Both Miami and TermiteTCP were easy to install. TermiteTCP uses a standard Commodore Install script to install the program. During the install process, you are asked to type in the serial number which then serialises both the install disk and the hard drive installation. Miami has no install script. You simply download the archive and expand it to any location. There are no paths or assigns to set, so you can freely move the program around wherever is convenient, so long as all the files remain in the same directory. As Miami is a shareware program, some features are disabled. By registering, you will receive a key file to enable the additional features. However, the disabled features do not in any way diminish the basic functionality of the program.

Configuration: Miami really shines here. Total time to dearchive, install, configure and connect to my ISP was an astonishingly low 10 minutes. I didn't even crack open the manual. The Readme.first file was enough to get going, because Miami completely walks you through the procedure. It comes with a companion program called Miamilnit, that asks for some basic information such as serial device, phone number and modem settings. Miami includes a list of preconfigured modem settings for a number of popular modems, so you generally won't have to fumble with your modem's manual to answer these questions. It then asks whether you are configuring for SLIP, PPP, TIA or Slirp, your IP address, (if you are issued a static address), your login and password, and then it dials your provider. A window will pop up in which records your login actions. There are buttons to send your login and password, and then you can manually navigate through any additional login menus until your SLIP/PPP connection is established. Then, if you are configuring for PPP, Miami will negotiate an optimum connection. It will also attempt a DNS lookup to find the available DNS servers on your network. This may or may not be successful, depending on whether your provider supports DNS lookup, but if it fails you will just have to type in the DNS IPs that your provider has given to you. It will then verify the validity of those servers, and hang up, storing a complete configuration. After that you simply run the main Miami program and import the configuration. Then away you go. It's that easy. The script recorder works flawlessly, provided you don't make any typos/backspaces in the process. The main program allows you to edit the script if necessary. I've used script recorders on various terminal programs before, and

generally you have to tweak them to get them to work properly, even if you typed correctly. This is because the script tries to send commands before they are prompted, or waits too long. Modifying the wait commands usually fixes the problem. I had no such problems with Miami, however. My script worked flawlessly first time, every time.

TermiteTCP was also fairly easy to configure. Configuration is accomplished in the main program, however you need to know all the information in advance and set the configuration before attempting a connection. The only exception is the login script. It also has a script recorder, and it worked flawlessly once I figured out how it worked. I had to look in the manual to figure out how to start and stop recording and save to disk. Not terribly difficult, but not immediately obvious either (Miami starts and stops the recorder automatically). Total elapsed time was about 25 minutes.

Miami has many more configuration options that TermiteTCP, especially for PPP. You can tweak the configuration for better performance or use the defaults (there are no PPP configuration settings in TermiteTCP, so you are stuck with the internal settings). TermiteTCP is limited to the standard modem settings and provider information. There is only provision for one phone number. DNS servers are limited to 2 entries, and there is no setting for MIU. Miami gives you many different options for TCP/IP/PPP settings. TermiteTCP does not support SLIP/CSLIP protocols. You must have a PPP connection to use it. Miami supports SLIP/CSLIP/PPP connections. I haven't tested TermiteTCP with TIA yet. TermiteTCP does not claim to work with TIA or Slirp. It may not work since it doesn't have a "Fake IP" option.

Other Options: Miami has an internal database similar to AmiTCP for services, users, etc, which allows you to configure server daemons and allow for remote users on your system. The database is configured with the GUI, unlike AmiTCP where you have to load a text file into an editor to add or change entries. There is no database of any kind in TermiteTC, so I doubt it is possible to add any services or allow other users to login to your computer. I don't know how you could set up TermiteTCP for Amiphone, for instance. There is no mention of this capability in the documentation. Miami also has a unique automatic activity generator which will send out a ping packet periodically at a user configurable interval. This is useful if you have a provider that disconnects after a period of inactivity. This will keep you from being disconnected should you exceed the limit.. while reading a document online for example.

Clients: Miami comes with no client software. TermiteTCP comes with FTP and Telnet clients but they are very rudimentary. The shareware AmfTP is MUCH better, and is worth the registeration fee. The termite Telnet client is OK, but it would not log in to my shell account using a preset login and password configuration. It would only work if I logged in manually. Other than that it seemed to work OK. There are several freeware/shareware Telnet clients available on Aminet. I wouldn't choose TermiteTCP over Miami based on the inclusion of these clients.

API: Miami is compatible with the AmiTCP API. TermiteTCP uses its own API, but also includes compatibility with the AmiTCP API. Both programs will work with AmiTCP clients. TermiteTCP includes a Software Development Kit for programmers who wish to write clients specifically for the TermiteTCP API. One drawback to TerminteTCP's custom API is that the included clients are written for this API so they will not run with any other TCP/IP stack. It is unknown to me whether Miami or TermiteTCP will work with AS225 clients. The API is not supported directly, but they may work with the addition of the socket library found on Aminet. There are, however, few clients written specifically for AS225 that do not also support the AmiTCP API.

Speed: TermiteTCP is marginally faster at dialing and connecting, due to the fact that Miami has to deal with the overhead of MUI windowing operations. But once on line, speed is not a factor.

Both Miami and TermiteTCP claim to have a quick auto-reconnect feature that allows you to skip dial-in and negotiation after a system crash, if you have set the modem to stay online. Only Miami's seems to work, however. The TermiteTCP manual mentions it, but doesn't give any specifics on how to get it to work. The default config hangs up the modem on a loss of DTR signal, but after changing it so the modem would stay online, TermiteTCP apparently still insisted on trying to redial and/or renegotiate PPP. It's possible my provider does not allow renegotiation of PPP. Either way, Miami's reconnect feature that allows bypassing both dialing and renegotation works with my provider.

Documentation: TermiteTCP comes with a thick printed manual, but 2/3 of this is devoted to a guide to the Internet for new users. Only 18 pages are devoted to the program's operation, with another 22 devoted to the FTP and Telnet clients. Miami's AmigaGuide manual is far more descriptive.

Online Help: Miami provides online help in the form of MUI "Balloon Help." If you place the mouse cursor on any gadget, and leave it there for a few seconds, a bubble will pop up telling you what the gadget does. Additionally, pressing the "Help" key loads the AmigaGuide manual to a context sensitive section of the document. TermiteT CP has no online help.

Price Comparison: Miami - $35. TermiteTCP $69.95 (Oregon Research currently has a direct mail order promotional price of $59.95.)

Unregistered Disabled Features: TermiteTCP N/A. Miami's disabled features mimallly affect the program's functionality. Connection time is limited to l hour sessions. At 1 hour Miami will spontaneously disconnect. A 30 minute warning is provided. Auto online after passive offline is disabled. ARexx scripts are disabled. There is a limit of three phone numbers. Phone

logging is disabled. Some MUI GUI customization options are disabled.

Registration: Since TermiteTCP is a commercial program, registration is simply a matter of returning a completed registration card. Miami uses an online 3 step registration program. The first step is to order a license code. You do this from the main program which asks for your name, address, etc, and your e-mail address. You can send in the request online or via slow mail. To send it in online you must have a "First Virtual" payment account established. This account allows you to purchase merchandise online without revealing your Credit Card Number in your e-mail. For slow mail you can use check, money order or cash. Once the author or other registration site receives your license request and payment, he will e-mail you a license code. This code is necessary to run the second step which is the actual registration. This step automatically sends an encrypted registration request, and in a few minutes another encrypted registration code will be returned. With this file you will run the third step that creates a pair of keys from the encrypted e-mail. These keys enable the additional features. The registration process sounds more complicated that it actually is. If for some reason the automatic registration fails, you can send the request directly to the author's e-mail address and he will process it manually. It took 3 days from the time I sent my check via slow mail until the author sent me the license code. The second two steps took just a few minutes. This is by far the fastest response I have ever had registering a shareware product.

Conclusion: Let me just say that Miami beats TermiteTCP hands down. It's easier to use, has many more options, and is considerably cheaper. It is, by far, the best TCP/IP stack around for dial up connections. I think that $35 for Miami and $25 for AmFTP is a much better deal than $59.95 for TermiteTCP. It's amazing what a nickel will buy you these days. Yes, it does require MUI, which will cost an additional $35 to register, but you will need MUI anyway as most of the Internet Client software requires it. Miami is truly the most amazing piece of Amiga software I have seen in a very long time.

## Amiga Web Browsing

amiga passes the test by Sandy McMurray, Toronto Sun onths ago, I got e-mail from a guy named Dan ·something about the Amiga computer. My answer was simple:

"Probably never."

I didn't have an Amiga, and I didn't know anyone with an Amiga. Besides, what does the Amiga have to do with the Internet? I remembered the Amiga as a game machine with fantastic sounds and graphics. And somewhere in the fuzzy back of my head, I seemed to remember that Commodore had gone out of business. Dan gave me a quick history lesson.

Yes, Commodore went out of business in 1994, but it was not the end of the Amiga. A German company called Escom bought the Amiga and announced plans for an affordable new Amiga called the Walker that was to debut this year. (Amiga has been sold again since. See below.)

## HONEST REVIEW

I was interested. Dan arranged for me to have the use of a new Amiga 1200, supplied by Amiga retailers Comspec and National Amiga. Dan asked me to use the machine, then write a simple, honest review of it. "If you think it's terrible, I want you to say that it's terrible," he said. "If you think it's great, I want you to say that."

So here I am.

The Amiga has always been an engineer's dream machine. Like the Macintosh, the Amiga was years ahead of PC technology. When the Amiga 1000 debuted in 1985, the industry was impressed by its custom chip set, and its excellent sound and graphics capabilities. The 1000 shipped with four-channel stereo sound and a 4096 colour output (better than the 16 colours most computers used at the time). Years after the Amiga did it, PC manufacturers are finally figuring out that consumers might want stereo output (RCA plugs) from their computer.

The Amiga was also the first computer with a true "preemptive multitasking" operating system, which allowed it to do several things at once — something a Pentium running Windows 95 still can't do as well as an Amiga. And the Amiga 1000 cost about US$2,000 when its competition — a "singletasking" 286 PC - cost about $4,000.

These days, many Amiga users are into complicated image processing, 3D modeling, etc. This is possible on the Amiga using inexpensive software and very little memory or hard disk space.

But my interest is the Internet connection. The Amiga 1200 is a relatively inexpensive way to browse the World Wide Web in all its graphical glory. The latest "IBrowse" and "AWeb" software supports HTML 3.2 commands, so you won't feel like a second-class Web citizen. And e-mail software like YAM (short for "Yet Another Mailer") works as well as anything I've used for the PC or Mac.

As PC manufacturers slowly catch up with the Amiga's multimedia power, Amiga owners bitterly lament the marketing and business mistakes that have made the Amiga an artifact rather than Everybody's Computer. I know this is an overused analogy, but the Amiga is like the Betamax video machine: Technically superior, but a loser in the marketplace. Amiga evangelists will be pleased to know that Chicago-based Visual Information Service Corporation (VIScorp) hopes to bring Amiga technology into every home. VIScorp has just purchased the Amiga from Escom, and they plan to build and market a sort of Internet appliance using Amiga technology. See (www.vistv.com) for more information.

## NOT EASY TO USE

My quick review would be that the Amiga 1200 is powerful, but not especially easy to use. My parents, who are just getting used to their Macintosh, would not be comfortable at all with the Amiga, but I think anyone with a mind for programming or engineering would learn to love it. If you're interested, the Amiga is an inexpensive and powerful computer that can get you on the Web. See (www.amigasupport.com) or call me at (416) 947-2416 for more information. I'll write more about the Amiga as I continue to use it.

How's that, Dan?

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke ibersho i by the loften This is the premiere picture viewing utility for CyberGraphX systems and it will work with AGA systems too. This version will show pics in greyscale only unless you're registered. If you've already registered, this is your upgrade (registration is nothing more than a key-file). Cyber Show will show pictures of almost any format using its built-in routines. If it doesn't have a built-in routine for a particular picture format, it will use your system datatypes. It will even save in multiple formats, so it can function as a simple picture converter as well. I consider it a must have. It's on MCCC-A\_1137.

## PhotoAlbum v1.2a by Helmut Hoffman

Another must-have for CyberGraphX systems. PhotoAlbum shows a directory of pictures as thumbnails. Click on a thumbnail to see the full picture. Multiple picture windows can be open at the same time. Picture databases can be stored. Like CyberShow, you have to register to get the color version, but it's well worth registering. This one's on MCCC-A\_1138.

## MUI v3.6 by Stefan Stuntz

I need to clear something up here. A lot of people seem to have a misconception of what MUI is. The main thing it isn't is a "hack." A hack, in computer terms, (although not necessarily a bad thing) is something that modifies the way that your system operates. MUI doesn't modify your system in any way. If you don't run any programs that use the MUI interface, then MUI just occupies space on your hard drive. What MUI does is provide some standard (and very powerful) routines for programmers to use when they design the Graphic User Interface (GUI) for their program. If you run a program that requires MUI and you don't have it, that program doesn't run. Whether to run MUl or not to run MUI is not a decision that a user can make...it's a decision that a 'programmer makes when he writes his program. Some programmers choose not to use MUI, but an increasing number are climbing on board the MUI train. How come? It makes programming easier and it's a very nice looking interface. MUI doesn't provide anything that the programmer couldn't provide himself, but why should he re-invent the wheel?

MUI (Magic User Interface) is getting to be something of a system requirement. There are a lot of programs out there now that use the MUI library for their Graphic User Interface, so you have no choice but to use MUL or go without a lot of excellent programs.

Anyway, if you haven't installed it, it's about time you did. This version is required by some new programs, notably [Browse, so even if you already use it, it's time to upgrade. Youll find it on MCCC-A\_1140 in LZX archived format.

## MUI Classes

Speaking of MUI, there are a couple of new MUI classes in the library this month. What's a MUL class, you ask? It's just a new object type that programmers who use the MUI GUI can use. Like MUl itself, these do nothing unless you have a program that uses them, but they're here now. If you install them now, you won't have to look for them later. There's a Month-Navigator class on MCCC-A\_1146, a Magnify class on MCCC-A\_1147, an Icon class and a Busy class on MCCC-A\_1153, and a Tron class on MCCC-A\_1154.

## SCSI List

Speaking of nice programs that use MUI, SCSI List is just a simple little program that scans your system for all the SCSI devices it can find. Then for each one, it displays all the devices connected to it and some information about each one. It comes in handy sometimes for finding out what your device numbers are, whether the devices are SCSI or SCSI-II, and other important information. And, thanks to MUI, it looks great. It's on MCCC-A\_1147.

## Magic Workbench Icons

Need some more icons? I find I always need more. This month there are a number of collections. You'll find some on disks MCCC-A\_1144, MCCC-A\_1145 and MCCC-A\_1146.

## Eldritch by J.N. Weatherall

Finally, a game worth writing about...and worth taking up space on my hard drive. I can't say I played it extensively, but I've played it some and it appears to be interesting. Nothing mind boggling here. Eldritch is a graphical dungeons and dragons game. Find your way through a dungeon maze, picking up weapons and other things and killing the bad guys. Looks to me as though it's worth a little time. This one is on MCCC-A\_1152.

## Next by Jurgen Klawitter

Need a new text viewer? If you're still using More, you do. Next is good enough that I'm using it now on our official club disks. Is it the best I've seen? Nope. MI is still the best, but Next is a lot smaller and thus can fit on the club disks a lot easier. It's easy to use and full of features. And it works with just about any version of the Amiga OS. It first appears on MCCC-A\_1153.

## Amiga Maintenance

tips for keeping your amiga in top running condition by O. Watagu Slam ike any other electronic device, the Amiga needs Look reneg Thee aska can bo early peak efficiency. These tasks can be easily performed by the user, provided you are comfortable dealing with hardware. Listed below are some of the most common computer maintenance practices.

After a long period of use, many files get deleted. These files are removed from the system and put in the bit bucket. Therefore, it is important to empty the bit bucket periodically, or the system may run a little slow. This can be easily accomplished by carefully removing the bit bucket, putting your hand over the top as a lid, and dumping the contents into any trashcan, being careful not to spill the bits all over the carpet. Occasionally, a vacuum is necessary to remove the last few bits.

Another common practice is to re-anchor the floating point processors. After heavy use, the floating point processor can float excessively and it must be fixed to its mooring. Care must be taken not to exert excessive force or you may turn the floating point processor into a fixed point processor.

data, as the bits get stuck on the soft drive. By heating the drive platters over a Bunsen burner, the stiffness returns, returning performance to near new conditions.

Refilling of the RAM chips is necessary after several years of use, so that a constant supply of bits is available. It is not advisable to recycle the bits from the bit bucket, as they are never as reliable the second time around and may cause erratic system performance.

The monitor also requires periodic maintenance to refill the red, green and blue phosphors. If your monitor is looking a little dull and colorless, check the phosphor storage bin. Replacement phosphor dots are commercially available; however, since this is a high voltage device, adding phosphors should not be attempted by the user.

Simple routine maintenance can keep your system in top running condition, much like your car or house. Performed regularly, this can avoid expensive repair bills in the future.

Although often overlooked, the hard drive must occasionally be removed and tempered so the drive does not go soft (or floppy!). This could result in the loss of

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga By-The-Loop

Johnny Kitchens kept him away. As an alternate, Ned Kelly took charge and started a very relaxed and informative meeting.

August is usually looked upon as the last real month of summer, bringing with it some of the hottest days of the year. It also has the last days off before school starts again. For our club, it brought a new meeting place... and what a meeting place! For our August meeting, the Amiga by the Loop chapter moved to the Bell Helicopter Training Facility. This new location features many things needed to make our meetings much more enjoyable. Features such as a Sony overhead projection TV system, which the Amiga adapts to readily, VCR's, phone lines, and some really comfortable chairs with tables. Along with getting a new location come the usual problems of getting things set up right due to unfamiliarity with the new location. After much searching, adapting, and discovery we got underway!

We got started with our meeting by talking about MetCom. By the time you read this, MetCom will be history, so I won't say more about it here. Our main presentation came from David Campbell. He demonstrated HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. This first meeting at the new location and this subject really convinced me that the new location was a winner. The overhead projection system allowed David to show everyone in the room everything easily. The phone line allowed connection to the Internet. The better furniture allowed a more comfortable presentation for all. Strangely , enough, the meeting was not long enough for everyone it seemed. I looked forward to the next meeting!

Our September meeting demonstrated the versatility of our club in coming up with alternatives in an emergency. Our chapter president and presenter for the night had an unexpected occurrence that

We began with a talk with Mark Stodola on MetCom. Then Ned, who is also our club librarian, made the announcement that the library would soon begin to use FFS as the official format for all club disks. This will allow more storage as well as a quicker disk.

A question on the Amiga's ownership came up first. At the time of the meeting, VisCorp still didn't have control of Amiga. The expected date was September 20. A question on BBS problems was voiced. Questions on IBrowse, the shareware version, about to expire. Luckily, a new version came out! IBrowse and Voyager are the Netscape and Explorer of the Amiga world. IBrowse is in the lead at the moment, but the new version of Voyager may change that soon. A question on how to make the Dir command perform a certain display came up next. An was suggested. We then went to a very to get data into your computer faster. Someone asked about the availability of an Amiga magazine from here in the States. They thought that Amazing Computing had faded away! It's still there printing new magazines. The availability of a 33600 baud modem for $109.97 was talked about next. Seems Circuit City has them, but some don't know it! The SyQuest EZ drive's new lower price was announced. Questions on reading text files on the BBS came up, as well as questions on the BBS, and the strange ARexx messages that were randomly appearing on the BBS. All was answered I hope. We had a very long talk on the problems of fast modems. We covered such things as phone lines, fast serial cards, types of modems and settings.

Discussions on the rumor of Digital's interest in the Amiga.

Someone heard they wanted to build a clone. Another rumor is that VisCorp doesn't want the PowerPO chip, and has decided the Digital Alpha chip is the way to go. This thought has been floating around for a long time.

We ended the night's meeting with a viewing of the club's "Jay Miner Memorial" tape. This tape features a 45 minute talk Jay Miner, "The Father of the Amiga," gave at the 1989 MetCom. This clearly demonstrated the advantages of the meeting room's overhead projection TV system. I felt I was face to face with day Miner. That was great since I was at the back of the room when the event took place. I had trouble at the time getting a good view as Jay talked. This view was better, because he looked bigger than life, which is a good way to view him. Again I look forward to seeing what we will have at our next meeting. Come on out on October 8 and see for yourself?

## Amiga North Dallas Michael Turner

Our last two meetings have been virtual expositions of technical information concerning the Amiga. In August, questions about scanner resolutions, printer drivers and printer compatibility, system monitor programs, and the AmigaOS file system in general headed the list. Ned Kelly explained very clearly what the info files are to one confused member and also demonstrated how the Workbench files are grouped and how they work with the Workbench screen. Eddie Corr demonstrated the use of the "assign" command and how it works. He also explained the use of virtual devices and how the "assign" command works with them. We then had a short demonstration of the functions of word processors using Final Writer. Yours truly even got some good advice dealing with

hooking up his CD-ROM to his (very old) SCSI interface. Also, one member brought a few handouts concerning VisCorp's never-ending purchase of Amiga Technologies.

In September, one member showed several interesting demos using the Amiga's great graphics capabilities from a CD-ROM. Also demonstrated was the CD-ROM version of Alien Breed. Another member brought his entire system to see if our group could bring his computer back to life. The problem turned out to be that some files were missing in the Prefs directory. Actually, all the files were missing in the Prefs directory! Actually, there was no Prefs directory at all! That was the problem... A copy of the Prefs directory and its files proved to be the solution.

Speaking of demonstrations, several members have mentioned wanting to see a demonstration of a CyberGraphX board. Does anyone out there have one? We are always looking for presenters, and I have always found our group to be a most laid-back, unassuming and receptive audience. Contact Dan if you have an idea for a presentation.

Ned Kelly mentioned that the MCCC Library will be switching soon to the new FastFile System and all the Library disks he brings will soon be using this file system. So, if anyone still using Workbench 1.2 or 1.3, you will need to upgrade to read these disks. A member thought that there was a PD program in the MCCC library that would allow Workbench 1.3 to use the new FastFile System but wasn't sure. Does anyone know?

In September, the Community Room in Richardson Square Mall got a face lift and now has a big sign in front of it that says (get this) "COMMUNITY ROOM." No longer will our meeting area be known as "Room 6501" on the mall directory. It should be easier to find. Here are the meeting dates for our next two meetings: Thursday, October 24 and Thursday, November 21. As outlined before, the mall is graciously allowing us to use their Community Room. We can only book this room three months in advance, thus sometimes we do not always get our first choice for meeting times. We generally try to get a Tuesday or Thursday as close to the end of the month as we can. Because in December the mall uses the room as a Christmas gift-wrapping center, the room is unavailable during that month. Meeting times are the usual 7:30 p.m. See Ya'll There!

## Metro C64/128 Mary Louise Hagemeyer Mike Sessums

Despite the August heat, our dedicated C-64 and 128 users met to share ideas. Mike Sessums ran Flight Plan 64, a freeware program that allows pilots to organize their data for filing a flight plan. Mike said he downloaded it from a local pilot's BBS (perhaps Contrails) a tew years ago. This program was quite complex, requiring the pilot to enter the latitude and longitude of various waypoints. Airports were identified by entering their three digit identifier, such as DFW for DallasFort Worth International Airport. This program should now be available in the library. Although we didn't need it for the simple flight plan we worked on during our meeting, Mike said that more complex flight plans may require a RAM extender.

The next demonstration was a commercial program called Injured Engine from Imagic, a game that simulates an ailing automobile engine. This was complete with engine sounds and a cutaway view of the engine, belts, fan, etc. After the mechanic (game player) analyzes the visual and audio clues, he then goes to the diagnostics shop screen. Once there, the mechanic can test or replace items such as the battery, emission control system and starter. Mike said this was a great learning game and he had even used it to solve a problem in real life. Once a mechanic solves his first problem and fixes the injured engine, he is then assigned an engine with two problems. This went on until we gave up on a car that had too many breakdowns. (Like real life, eh?)

One handy tip Mike showed us was how to use the Commodore and Shift keys to switch the screen characters from upper case/graphics to upper/lower case text. This may seem like one of those "so, what?" things, but when a listing looks like gibberish, you might be able to use this trick to turn it into text! He demonstrated this as he ran a program that played the "Dr. Who" theme.

In the September meeting, we had the announcement that Jo Lynn would not be offering her services as our Librarian/Treasurer, so those posts will be open. It is also possible that neither Brenda nor Mike will be available as officers, so that may leave the President and Vice President positions open. Elections will be here before long, so be thinking of who else you would like to see from our roster of fine chapter members to fill in these posts.

Mike demonstrated a commercial program called Dream House. With this game, you select your house's floor plan or architectural style, provide landscaping, hang wall paper, and even animate objects. This is Brenda's favorite, next to Little Computer People.

Once again, Commodore Country provided some exciting door prizes, including joysticks and games, for our door prize winners.

Well, we hope everyone had fun at MetCom '96 and found lots of bargains and treasures in the flea market. Be sure to come to our next meeting for more fun!
