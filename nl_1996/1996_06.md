## Sold Again!

Escom to sell Amiga Technologies to VIScorp here we go again….

E ditor's note: The article that follows is a news story , that first broke on April 12, 1996. Because the club only produces a newsletter every other month, this was the first opportunity I had to publish it. It's not really news any more, but in the interest of historical import, I wanted to include it here. The articles that follow provide more recent information. As far as I can tell, VIScorp's only interest in Amiga is to use in its settop boxes and to make money providing products for hardware that they supply (via their settops) or that some other licenced company manufactures. It appears that they are going to leave any real computer products for other companies to develop. Read the speech beginning on page 4 and see if you don't agree. This doesn't look like good news to Amiga COMPUTER users. VIScorp may make money, but I can't see myself spending an evening in front of a settop box.

To this humble reporter, it appears our salvation may lie with phase 5 digital products. They will be marketing a PowerPC upgrade card as well as a new PowerPC-based computer running a new Amiga-OS that will still be compatible with our current AmigaOS 3.1. (Refer to the article beginning on page 6.) phase 5 digital products is the company who brought us CyberGraphX, as well as a number of accelerators, SCSI controllers, and graphics cards — they know what they're doing. Hang in there. More information will be provided as it becomes available. Bill Raecke

Heppenheim, Germany and Chicago, IL, April 12, 1996

ESCOM AG, a German computer manufacturer and reseller and Visual Information Services Corp. (Nasdaq: VICP, Bulletin Board), a developer of interactive TV (ITV) set-top-boxes to enhance television use and viewing by providing Internet access and electronic communications function, today jointly announced that a binding letter of understanding has been signed between the companies.

The letter states that Chicago-based VIScorp would acquire Amiga Technologies, including the intellectual properties of the former Commodore Business Machines, excepted Commodore trademarks. The transaction value is approximately US $40 million. Terms were not disclosed, and the pending acquisition would be subject to approval by both companies' boards of directors.

"This intended acquisition is part of VIScorp's strategy to build market leadership in the fast-growing field of ITV", said William Buck, Chief Executive Officer. "As a result, we would own Amiga intellectual properties, including several that are currently used in our set top box, Electronic Device (ED(). We would also have control over the supplied chip sets used in ED as well as Amiga inventories and access to the company's current sales and distribution channels."

Commenting the proposed acquisition, Helmut Jost, chief executive of ESCOM AG, said: "VIScorp has a clear vision of the Amiga technology potential for ITV applications. We are eager to support and work together over the term of the letter of understanding to ensure a smooth transition between the two companies. VIScorp anticipates the support of ongoing European sales of popular models such as the A4000T and the A1200 as well as the current developments and future releases of Amiga Technologies."

Petro Tyschtschenko, president of Amiga Technologies stated "I am looking forward to being able to take advantage of the research and development support potential that an Amiga-related company like VIScorp can provide."

Commenting that the primary objective of the proposed acquisition is to give VIScorp full access to the Amiga technology to support development of its ITV device, Mr. Buck noted: "Our intention is to rapidly develop and begin manufacturing TV set-top interactive boxes — products that give home users capabilities such as telephone reception and dial up capabilities, facsimile, video games, pay-per-view options, electronic mail, and access to on-line services, including the Internet."

the corporate information packet who are these people, anyway?

isCorp is an Illinois corporation with offices in Pennsylvania and in the Silicon Valley area of California.

VisCorp has developed a unique interactive set-top device (trademarked "ED") that enables a host of new interactive services that can be delivered over existing cable or even telephone systems, without the necessity for new and highly expensive hybrid fiber/coaxial broadband plant. This new platform is designed to be low cost and enables the television set to act much like a modemequipped computer with all functions being controlled by a familiar hand-held remote control.

The ED provides unique telephone management features, on-screen TV program guides, fax and e-mail, Internet access, and the ability to down-load and play arcade quality video games right on the TV. With a nontechnical and friendly front-of-screen experience and a target retail price of about $300, ED will make the information superhighway accessible to the mass market.

## Business Case

On-line services are growing rapidly. By some estimates access to the Internet is growing at a rate as high as 20% per month and is expected to top 100 million users world-wide by the end of 19961. Many cable and telephone companies are launching trials of broadband video-on-demand interactive technologies.

However modem-equipped personal computers are still priced well out of the reach of many families and their complexity remains daunting to others. Interactive television technology to support full motion video-ondemand is still extremely expensive with most digital settops being priced in excess of $1,000. Further, in order to deliver compelling programming, such set-tops must be backed-up by tens of millions of dollars in telecommunications infrastructure upgrades including ATM switching systems and powerful digital servers in each market.

It is VisCorp's belief that there is a market opportunity to provide revenue producing interactive services to the mass market that do not involve deployment of such technologies and which are far cheaper and easier to use than the typical PC.

To do this, VisCorp has designed a set-top appliance that uses a highly efficient design and operating system that greatly reduces the amount of memory needed to manipulate video images on the TV. Memory is the one irreducible cost in digital electronics, and by reducing a dependence on memory, VisCorp has brought the cost of the device down to where it can penetrate the mass market.

VisCorp intends to license consumer electronics manufacturers and distributors to produce the hardware and market it to consumers. VisCorp has had preliminary discussions with several manufacturers, including Pioneer, Zenith, Toshiba and Freedom Star. Unless offered a substantial up-front exclusive royalty, VisCorp intends to provide as many manufacturers as possible with the right to use the technology.

VisCorp expects to get only a relatively low revenue stream from this manufacturing licenses, and instead plans to receive substantially all of its revenue from the variety of services it intends to make available through the ED. The nominal licensing fee is designed to encourage a low-priced device to be offered with the expectation of greater acceptance by consumers and a level of market penetration that will permit the use of the ED as a new electronic publishing platform.

While the ED will be an open system and, in theory, any application developer can write for it, the ability to develop applications to run in the reduced memory environment of the ED is not widely available. Consequently, VisCorp's intimate knowledge of the operating system is expected to enable it to get to market sooner with more compelling programming than any emergent competition.

As this happens, product marketing on this new medium will grow explosively. Whether the consumer is looking for a movie, an interactive game, a house, a sweater, a particular kitchen appliance, or simply information about a vacation destination, he or she will need the ability to either quickly locate a specific product or service or to have fun browsing selections while looking for an impulse purchase opportunity.

## The DD Interactive Set-Top

The Company's initial hardware product, the ED, is an electronic device designed to be placed on top of — or next to — a television set. The ED is designed to permit consumers to perform a variety of functions and utilize a number of on-line interactive services which the Company expects to make available in the future, including video games, home shopping, educational programs and fax capability. To the extent these services are currently available to consumers they are not available except on office devices and personal computers. The ED can be marketed for a small fraction of the cost of such devices and also can support entirely new capabilities such as advanced telephone management.

The ED is essentially a highly cost-optimized computer with a graphical, simple-to-use interface which can be remotely configured from a host operating system. It comes equipped with a modem, video and audio circuitry and a controller. The ED is connected to an ordinary telephone line and uses the consumer's standard television set as a monitor. ED can present text and graphics on a television set using specially configured fonts so that it is readable at normal viewing distances. The ED can also overlay graphics and text on the television picture or bring up a solid background to facilitate information viewing

Included on the ED is a magnetic card stripe reader so that credit or debit cards may be swiped to confirm transactions and debit cards may be "filled" with electronic funds drawn on the consumer's bank. Some of the other features that the Company has implemented and intends to provide through the ED are:

The ED converts the consumer's television set into a high-quality duplex speaker phone with one-touch onscreen dialing so that calls may be placed from the living room couch with the remote control. In locations where caller ID is available, ED scans the incoming call and checks the number against a database. If it recognizes the number, ED scrolls the name of the incoming caller across the TV picture and the viewer may answer the call and speak to the person with a flick of the remote control.

- a user-friendly interface to the Internet including a Web Browser,
- in-home gaming and wagering,
- a linking mechanism to allow multiple users in different homes to play the same video games, competing in real time,
- a voice bulletin board on the Internet,
- one-touch remote dialing of 800 numbers for reservations, hotel booking, etc,
- classified and "Yellow Pages" type advertising,
- one-touch dialing of home delivery and catalog shopping services,
- guides to restaurants and other entertainment,
- statistics gathering programs to track consumer TV viewing patterns and usage of the of specific interactive services,
- distribution of electronic coupons,
- a complete transaction processing, tracking and billing mechanism,
- electronic banking including secure encryption and the ability to "fill" debit cards,
- various specialized applications for the hospitality and health care industries.

## Company Background

The Company was formed in Chicago, Illinois on May 1, 1990 under the name Information on Command, Inc. The Company changed its name to Visual Information Service Corp. on May 22, 1990. The Company has a limited history of operations. The principals of the Company began developing the ED technology in 1990 and first produced a prototype in May 1993. In November 1994, the Company hired its current managment team and in December 1994, the Company established a relationship with its first interactive service provider, NTN Communications, Inc. In May 1995, the Company licensed the rights to the former Commodore Amiga technology, now owned by ESCOM AG of Germany. By incorporating elements of the efficient Amiga chip-set and operating system into the ED box, the Company believes it can reduce manufacturing costs and also enable the ED box to utilize the vast library of exiting Amiga software, particularly arcade quality video games.

## Bill Buck Speaks

text of a speech by Bill Buck, CEO, VIScorp given at Toulouse, May 19, 1996

ood morning Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to Press Conference is a working conference. We asked you in the world of AMIGA shows to give us your ideas and your initiate us. We've had so many ideas that we've put in on the web site, and we had even more ideas. We had over 2000 e-mails that have been provided by users for the future of AMIGA. What we want to do here today, is we want to map out a strategy to you and we think the future of AMIGA to be and we want to make sure that you understand and we want to hear your ideas and your opportunity to participate in that future. So, I want to say before we began too much that excuse me for not answering, excuse us for

Eric stand up please. Eric really is an employee...he has business cards and please take one from him. And Eric really is the man who devised the survey and who implemented it and he did such a fantastic job answering all the e-mails. Thank you Eric. In addition to that, there was a staff of people very nervous who also helped physically support today. I really appreciate what they did for us. We have the rest of VIScorp Team here. We start here with Don Gilbreath, Carl Sassenrath, David Rosen and we have Curtiz Gangi, so here he is, and we have Petro Tyschtschenko and Stefan Haas. Okay.

## ...a Walker before Christmas? Don't think so...

not answering all your e-mail. You can imagine that we had millions and millions of e-mail messages that if there's something that you would like us us to respond to that we haven't responded to yet, you can be sure that I am responding to my e-mail as well as the rest of us now. In some cases... Eric as an example has done a fantastic job. He personally answered over 2000 e-mail messages himself. And Carl was probably on the record for good 1000 himself as well.

I will try to speak slowly, I know I have got a funny American accent but so, I try to do that. First, I do AMIGA show we've said that we will have a press conference in Germany around the end of the month. Because we had so many ideas come from you, in a community as a whole that said this kind of thing might be better, because we want to show the people and the press that we talking about what we are doing and we are doing what we're doing. And so somehow on the process of that information I think we got a little confused and we still had some information on the AMIGA Technologies web site that was different than ours and I apologize for that, especially to the people on the German AMIGA community who I don't want to feel excluded at all. We tried to answer a lot of questions before we came here about what our intentions were for AMIGA. It's our intention today to try to answer all the rest of the questions that you might have. So I'd ask, out of respect for everybody in the world, to hold their questions until we get to that point of the presentation today. We want to give you as much information as we can. When I finish my conversation, Raquel Valesco will give you the high points in French and in Spanish. Raquel stand up please. Raquel has been the driving force behind this conference. It was her idea, and the way it was organized and we proceeded was to her credit. We also have Eric Laffont.

Let's talk first about the AMIGA transaction. Okay, Bill Buck and Helmut Jost made a deal. It's based on trust, it's based on a handshake and it will probably be based on this much paper when it's all finished. Okay, it's not finished. Okay, Bill Buck and Helmut Jost have a deal, and when it's done, VIScorp will be the owner of AMIGA. One more thing I'd like to say about this. Raquel and I last week were the guest of the New York Stock Exchange. And we stood in the member's gallery with the treasurer and the secretary of the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest capital market in the world. He told us that the reason why the Stock Exchange works is because two people have a trust. And trust is based on a "purple" agreement, and for three days there's nothing written. There's no transaction. This agreement that Helmut Jost and I have at this point is we've waiting for this is based on trust and that's why we don't feel uncomfortable with this meeting today, and that's why I'm sure that this transaction will be completed.

The second thing I like to say for the record is that VIScorp is committed to the future of the AMIGA computer. We're committed to the AMIGA computer because we think the AMIGA computer represents a valuable choice to the marketplace and we believe it can be a profitable business. We think that means that we're gonna have to make some changes. We're gonna have to lever up the good things that have happened in the past and try to step beyond the things that everybody doesn't agree about, the difficulties that the platform has had in general...and we think we can do that and I will come back to that in a minute. Certainly, we believe in the operating system. We licensed it in December because we believe in the operating system. The fact that this opportunity was created for VIScorp because of the difficulties of ESCOM have nothing to do with our belief in the operating system. We believe in the operating system. We think it still lives. The only multimedia and multitasking operating system in the world in our opinion.

The second thing is, and probably the most important thing is, we believe in you. We believe in the community. Without a community of people like AMIGA has, AMIGA would be just like everybody else. You guy are fanatics! You can't believe the thousands of e-mail messages I got. We asked you for your ideas at the AMIGA show and we were amazed by how many ideas came back to us. It was overwhelming. So, what we realized is that there is a future for AMIGA. There had to be support, but this was going to be a little different in this case. Your ideas from everything you can imagine and we're gonna take advantage of all those ideas.

The first step we want to make to you, the community, is that we are ready to listen.. We think we demonstrated that we have the capacity to do that and that it's not our intention to change in that respect at all. The second thing we want to share with you are the results of our survey. We think it's very vital information and we intend to do that on our website. That's, in fact, how we intend to get a lot of information to you in the future. We hope in the next few weeks to post documentation on the website that will support you. We know that there are people who can't find this vital documentation that they need to do the things they want. We're gonna try to get back and use our website as our best means of communication to the community. You can't imagine all the different places in the world that we're talking to people about us.

We have a clear vision for what we want to do in the future and we believe we can support that vision. Let me just say from the outset that we think that in 1997 there will be more AMIGAs sold than there ever had been before. Most of those AMIGAs are gonna be our products and in products. It's not gonna happen because little VIScorp makes them, it's gonna happen because big companies decide to license the technology and put technology into existing products that they have. In the next few weeks there will be an announcement from us about a big company that makes TV-sets. We're gonna put these things inside the TV set. First, as we get ready to talk about the ED, and I'm sorry to say that we just have the ED in NTSC-version today because we had to develop our own operating system in the beginning which Carl wrote too by the way. It only works in this environment right now. That's the great thing about AMIGA, it works in all the other environments. You'll be able to see that product very shortly, but today we want to show you our ED, in black and white only, sorry.

Two things to remember here: The first thing is with all you AMIGA guys, we know you have a great imagination, so pretend it's in color. The second thing is that television technology hasn't changed in forty years. It's a great thing about what we are proposing to do. The computer changes every week, there's a faster processor, there's more memory and there's a new version of Windows 95..it takes 95 megabytes. There's lots of different things that are happening. This environment hasn't changed. It's a stable environment. It's a very fertile field for us to do something — fantastic things. One thing I would like to say before I get into the little demonstration of our ED. The past is the past, okay, I don't care about what happened before. This is a new deal. Don't whine on me about this or that. Look, I know that I'm not talking to you people because you are here on Sunday morning but there are a lot of people in the community that are still upset about things that happened before. This is something new. We're going forward, we're going to demonstrate it every step of the way we're going to go. That as an example that there are specific things that when we know what we're gonna do we will tell you. I can tell you right now...a Walker before Christmas...don't think so, okay. I think there may be some other company that may decide: It was a good idea. Okay, we don't have a power PC port ready for Christmas. We've got to do something. We have parts and hardware that can take advantage of the OS. We've got to show these people that we are moving a Great idea, it's a prototype. Somebody wants to pick up the ball and run with it, we're ready to try to support that person. And in the same way, still even this month there were people at AMIGA Technologies that were talking about the Walker being introduced this year. All I can say is that this person in particular doesn't work at AMIGA Technologies anymore. There are a lot of people that don't work at AMIGA Technologies anymore. The ones that we feel have something to add to what we're doing in the future are still there and work silent about then. And we have to put all that stuff behind us. That was just a little example.

Now what is Viscorp going to do for AMIGA? First thing is, we're gonna introduce a new operating system by the fourth quarter. If there are companies on the high end that have an interest in porting over the AMIGA OS to another processor, maybe the power PC, we're happy to support those people. No problem. We think there's another solution to this. We've been in conversations with DEC about the Alpha Chip, that can do 300 megahertz right now. We think that might be the right way to really boost the video. I think that's something that we are going to be working on and you might see something about that in the middle of 1997. Also on the low end we have our products. Our products are ready. We're gonna talk to you about them later. These things can be adapted in certain ways that can add new functionality to the A1200 level products. And we think there are some ways so that we can tweak the A1200 too. Or we can speed up the bus or something like that to help us get the chipsets to work a little faster. We think we can do a lot of things and that's why we wanna hear from you people because we think you might have ideas we don't know about. And we want to leverage off those. We're happy to let you participate in those idea's success. Okay. So, before I start talking about the ED, I'm going to ask Raquel to cover the main points in French and Spanish, just to make sure we're all together before we go to the next step. Raquel, please.

## the next generation phase 5 digital products' new Amiga-OS-compatible for 1997

A ccording to the plans of phase 5 digital products, Oberursel near Frankfurt, Germany, the coming · year, 1997, will be a year of joy for all Amiga enthusiasts. As an expansion of the PowerUp project, which involves developing PowerPC processor cards for existing Amiga models, the company has announced that an independent Amiga OS-compatible computer system will be available in the first six months of 1997, representing a revolution on the computer market. "We will continue to give our full support to the Amiga idea because as we were among the first Amiga users we continue to believe in the advantages and superior concepts of the Amiga" , says Wolf Dietrich, Managing Director of phase 5 digital products. "However, it is high time for a radical leap forwards in technology that needs to be borne by a vision of a computer for the next millennium. We have seen too many half-hearted efforts in the last few years." In the view of Gerald Carda, Technical Director at phase 5, it is necessary to take a step towards complete innovation in order to realise such a vision. "Concepts that build up on the standard components of the PC world never offer the scope that give a computer system the lead that the Amiga 1000 had over other systems 12 years ago."

In line with this philosophy, the new computer will be based on a highly integrated Custom Chip design which, as a central functional unit, will enable the system to achieve a hitherto unknown level of performance. "We will demonstrate the possibilities that are inherent in the resolute and single-minded pursuit of a new development that does not become submerged in the mainstream of adaptation to the Wintel world and the general tendency towards economy in the PC mass market which more or less throttles innovation for the sake of saving one single dollar", continues Gerald Carda. Despite this, the system now being announced is not intended to become a dream machine in the high price category. In the words of Wolf Dietrich: "On the basis of our current price calculation we will be able to offer unusually good value for money for which our products for the Amiga market are already renowned."

It is actually true that the extremely high degree of integration and the realisation of novel concepts will make it possible to achieve a performance that explodes existing bounds. Based on the PowerPC as the main processor, the new computer, in addition to the high performance of the processor, offers hardware support for multimedia (MPEG) and 3D functions, while even the basic system offers a resolution of 1600x1200 pixels at 24-bit color depth and a refresh rate of 72 Hz. At the same time special functions for image and video effects have been implemented in the hardware. In addition there are audio inputs and outputs in stereo CD quality, a videocompatible and Genlock-capable 24-bit video output and an FBAS/S-VHS video input. Along with the usual interfaces, the system is rounded off by a Fast SCSI-II controller, a network interface and an ISDN interface. With these features a complete system with a 120 MHz 603e PowerPC, 16 MByte memory, a SCSI hard disk of 1 GB and a quad-speed CD ROM will be available for a purchase price of around 3,000 DM (1,400 £ or 2,000 US$, respectively) on the basis of the present market prices for the components. "We hope that in just about one year from now we will even be able to offer a 150 to 166 MHz 603e-processor at this price" ", anticipates Wolf Dietrich. "In terms of performance the processor has no problems in keeping up with a Pentium processor with an equally fast clock. However, there is no sign of any comparable graphic performance anywhere the PC field and the features of our systems will be difficult to match." There will be a similar system available with a PowerPC 604-e processor and 150 MHz for about 4,000 DM (1,800 £ or 2,700 US$, respectively).

Although phase 5 digital products state that the total concept for the system has already been under development for quite some time and has practically been concluded, it is not possible to publish a more exact description of the system features at the present point in time. "At the moment we are intensively concerned with looking into whether it would be worth applying for a patent for any of the concepts we have developed and, if so, for which. So unfortunately we are not able to publish more precise details of the concept until after this process has been concluded and we have possibly applied for protection by patent", says Gerald Carda. For this reason we cannot reckon with any publication of the full system specifications until the end of June. Not only the hardware concept of phase 5, but also the software approach comes as a surprise. The new computer system will be supplied with a completely new operating system written in Native PowerPC code, but with binary compatibility with Amiga-OS 3.x. Here Gerald Carda has the following comments: "As we are already developing an Amiga-compatible PowerPC-Exec with an expansion library and a PowerPC CyberGraphX version in the context of the PowerUp developments, it is the logical consequence that the next step will be the innovative development of the other components. An operating system that is compatible with Amiga-OS 3.x makes it possible for the user to continue to use the existing software that can run under CyberGraphX, while developers who already give massive support to CyberGraphX will be able to continue to maintain and develop their products at the present level. In this way we

will be enabling Amiga users to switch to the new system without any problems." "In addition" , continues Gerald "we will be opening up ways of making considerable improvements in the internal structure and extensive additions to the scope of functions". Besides the 24-bit support which has already become a standard due to CyberGraphX, Gerald Carda names the coming CyberGraphX 3D and multimedia interface as an example. There will also be an optimisation of the system's performance and a revision and adaptation of the user interface in line with the functional and optical state of the art. "For years Amiga-OS has represented the conceptual realisation of ideas that today are propagated by many to be special innovations. This means that reprogramming will make it possible to achieve a really highly powered and modern OS. Of course our system will also be open for other operating systems or emulations, such as MacOS or an X-Windows link-up. The discussion concerning so-called new operating systems, however, was intended more as marketing hype than as a realistic alternative."

The commitment with which phase 5 digital products will force forward this project is reflected not least in the considerable volume of investment that has been made in the development. "By the middle of 1997 we will have invested seven-digit figures in this project" , says Wolf Dietrich. "We have the know-how, the development team, the technical equipment, the support from third parties (especially Motorola) and the financial basis for this project. The only thing that we still need is massive and positive support from the Amiga user base. With this early disclosure of our objectives we expect to receive the anticipated response from the users, for, after all, such a project only makes sense if there is still a large number of convinced Amiga fans. We therefore appeal to all Amiga fans to write to us, to send us faxes or to contact us via Email (under the address specially set up for this purpose: aproject@phase5.dev). Every positive reaction will strengthen this forward-looking project."

## PowerUP project continues to make progress

The PowerUp project also continues to make progress. "The delivery of the developer PowerPC boards will now start in summer" , says Gerald Carda. "Unfortunately, we are a few months behind in our schedule due to extensive discussions between Motorola, Amiga Technologies and phase 5. These companies were to agree on a close cooperation and clarify a number of matters, especially with regard to new standards specific to the new PowerPC. After the discussion concerning a takeover by VIScorp started and the wave or redundancies that directly followed at Amiga Technologies, which led to most of the contact persons who had been involved in the projects leaving the company, AT abandoned the present cooperation. For this reason we will waste no further time and will continue with our project on our own, which was the way in which we started it. Nor can we wait any longer to see what VIScorp might possibly intend or not intend."

The support for external developers in the PowerUp program is now complete. More than 250 developers including practically all noted commercial software suppliers in the Amiga field - are registered and their numbers are growing every day. This alone is evidence of the strong support for the future Amiga-compatible PowerPC platform. As from the second half of May, the registered users will now be able to order the PowerPC Beta developer boards from phase 5 which mean the green light for the hot phase of the world-wide software development.

## Motorola appreciates the concept of phase 5

In the realisation of their new, innovative computer system, phase 5 will be fully supported by Motorola. "We appreciate the powerful and innovative concept that phase 5 represents and we fully support the efforts of this company as a partner in our global PowerPC strategy. says John Letham, European Technical Marketing Manager, Motorola RISC Microprocessors. "We have had a number of joint meetings now and we are impressed by the know-how and vision that is the basis of phase 5's driving force."

## Technology demonstrations

In close cooperation with Motorola, phase 5 is preparing technology demonstrations, to be shown in due course, which will demonstrate the impressive capabilities of the next generation of PowerPC 603e CPUs at significantly increased clock rates. This programme is already underway and Summer of 1996 will see phase 5 present prototypes of PowerPC boards for Amiga 3000/4000 as well as for the Apple Macintosh 7500/8500/9500 series. "With the presentation of these new processors, Motorola as a leading semiconductor manufacturer clearly illustrates their capabilities demonstrating exactly why the next generation of PowerPC CPUs will hold the pole position in the microprocessor performance race" ", says Wolf Dietrich of phase 5. "Our computer system, when shipping next year, will also offer these extremely fast processors, delivering true high-end workstation performance. The higher speed of the CPUs will also deliver a performance increase to the upgrade boards for existing Amiga systems." With the presentation of this PowerPC technology demo on Apple MacIntosh system, phase 5 digital products announces their entry into the MacIntosh accelerator market. This new branch of their operation will make additional use of the PowerPC know-how that is been built up in the Amiga development, while for both the Amiga and the MacIntosh PowerPC products an even more attractive pricing can be realized due to the higher quantity demands of PowerPC processors.

## phase 5 digital products on the situation of Amiga Technologies

In addition to this project announcement, phase 5

also made some side remarks on the current state of affairs with regard to Amiga Technologies. "To our regret we found that Amiga Technologies offers us no sort of outlook or basis for developing into the future" ', says Wolf Dietrich. "The first year of Amiga Technologies was marked by a continued chain of wrong decisions which have been responsible for the bad situation in which the company now finds itself. The results must be adequate to the objectives set in the spring of 1995 and in this respect they are more than disappointing. There is no getting away from this. In fact, the same mistakes were made that were previously made at Commodore and partly by the same people. For example, attempts continue to keep technically outdated products on the market at unrealistic prices, which is particularly true in the case of the A4000T. Another point is that the marketing concepts are completely outdated, there is an absence of any kind of futuristic vision and a lack of any independent development, which is so pronounced that today AT neither has any 68060 technology to show for itself nor even a sign of any PowerPC technology. The brief spark of any independent development was extinguished again by the latest wave of redundancies. In this respect the only thing that we can just about expect from AT is that they sell off their large quantities of existing stock. These do give us some cause to hope that the existing products will be on the market for a while and that, in due course, they will be offered at more realistic prices. Pinally, the only thing that can be said about the activities of AT is: They should have asked someone who knows his stuff."

In the opinion of phase 5, a takeover of Amiga Technologies by VIScorp does not awaken hope of any major innovations or any strengthening of the Amiga system. "So far we have heard nothing from VIScorp that would cause us to assume that anything different is being planned than the exploitation of the Amiga technology in a settop box. Nor do we see why this company, which must certainly concentrate all its efforts on realising its settop projects, should be interested in further pursuing the primary aim of continuing with the Amiga system. If this had been the case, it would already have been quite feasible for VIScorp to initiate such a project as a licensee of the Amiga technology." phase 5 sees this critical opinion confirmed by current events. "The actions of VIScorp do not convince us that they are serious in continuing with the Amiga. So far, for example, VIScorp has not directly spoken to the developers who were the last to support the Amiga. Nor was there any reaction when we tried to make contact. The VIScorp meeting in Toulouse that has now been announced lacks any kind of organisation and was called without there being any recognisable concept behind it. For this reason it is more than doubtful whether even a sign of any constructive result can be expected to come out of it, so that in our view it would be a pure waste of time to attend, as we have repeatedly found in the recent year at ESCOM meetings. We don't need a repeat of that." Let it be mentioned in passing that the hope often expressed in the general discussion, i.e. that in VIScorp Amiga will find itself taken over by a company that will finance the development of a new generation of Amiga products more or less from the petty cash, is something that Wolf Dietrich considers to be very optimistic. "For a start we had exactly the same expectations a year ago when everyone thought that the giant ESCOM would get things moving at Amiga from a standing position and quickly produce a new generation of Amiga computers for a more competitive price. Secondly we should first wait and see whether the figures that have been bandied about in the discussion concerning VIScorp's takeover of AT have any sort of real fundament."

## About phase 5 digital products

phase 5 digital products, based in Oberursel near Frankfurt, are internationally operating manufacturers of hardware and software products. The company is entirely owned by its founders, Gerald Carda and Wolf Dietrich. Since the market launch of its first product line in 1992, this company, which consists of an experienced team of the first Amiga users and developers, quickly established itself as one of the leading manufacturers in the Amiga market. Since 1992 its products have been distinguished many times, including 20 awards for Product of the Year in Amiga journals. In 1995 phase 5 supplied accessories to the value of some DM 12 million (5.5 million £ or 8 million US$) in the Amiga market alone. Since the Christmas season of 1995 almost 30,000 hardware products have been delivered. The product portfolio for Amiga includes accelerator cards, SCSI controllers and graphics cards. In these fields phase 5 digital products has repeatedly proved itself to be manufacturer that is a forerunner and an innovative leader, for instance in bringing out the first Zorro III-DMA-SCSI controller world-wide, the Fastlane Z3, in producing the first 68030 card world-wide with a DMA-SCSI controller for the Amiga 1200, in offering the first 68060 card world-wide for Amiga systems (the Cyberstorm 060/50 for A4000), in manufacturing the first 64 bit graphics card world-wide with full system-integrated 24-bit support (the CyberVision64 for A3000/A4000) or in bringing out the first 68060 card for the A1200 world-wide, the Blizzard 1260. Along with intensive development activities as a Beta developer for Motorola in the 68060 and PowerPO field, hardware developments at phase 5 include pure research work in the field of multimedia high-performance DSPs and in the latest development department ASE (advanced silicon engineering) VLSI chip design. An expanding team of some 20 staff is currently working on these projects at the company's headquarters in Oberursel on premises covering an area of 960 square metres. In the adjoining service area, which covers an area of almost 600 square metres, the company, as from August '96, will be producing hardware products - including the new PowerPC products — in its own, highly modern manufacturing plant using the most recent manufacturing techniques.

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

There are some beautiful digitized pics on out. They made beautiful Workbench backgrounds on my CyberGraphX-based system. Even without CyberGraphX, they're breathtaking. There are six scenic shots in all.

## CyberShow by Helmut Hoffmann

Speaking of CyberGraphX, there's an updated version (7.1) of Cyber Show on MCCC-A\_1090. CyberShow is the best and most versatile picture viewing utility I have found. It works on AGA systems as well as on CyberGraphX systems.

## CyberTVPlayer by Helmut Hoffmann

Also for use with either AGA or CyberGraphX systems, CyberTVPlayer is an powerful animation viewer. Things just look a whole lot better in 256 or better colors. It's on MCCC-A \_1081.

## CyberAVI by Thore Bokelmann

Lots of stuff this month for CyberGraphX systems. Probably ought to get used to it — it looks as though CyberGraphX will be the system standard for the new generation of Amigas coming from phase 5 digital products. At any rate, this utility will show AVI i BO AVI animations that you might get from a PC CD-ROM. I had a lot of them with no way to look at them until now. AVI quality is nothing to write home about, but at least there's a way to see them now. The utility couldn't be simpler to use — just pass it a file name. I quickly added it to Directory Upus. CyberA Vi is on MCCC-A \_ 1089.

## MCP by ALİENDESiGN

MCP (Master Control Program) is the most powerful multifunction commodity money can't buy. It's released as freeware. It replaces virtually ALL of the other commodities in your system with one beautifully-written program. It provides a screen promoter, a mouse blanker, a mouse accelerator, a disk drive stop-click, an Assign Wedge, a font cache, a gadget look-improvement patch, a cycle-to-menu patch... You get the idea. There are dozens of functions...far too many to detail here. Many of them you won't find elsewhere. If you are using another commodity patch, it's time to change. Version 1.11 is the latest. You'll find it on MCCC-A\_1085.

## ToolManager by Stefan Becker

This is a minor improvement to a program you are undoubtedly already using. If not, it's time to get with it. ToolManager provides a way for you to add menu items, appicons, docks and hotkeys to your system (just about everything you don't get with MCP). The update allows you to close your Workbench (for instance, when changing screen display modes) without losing your docks. The version is 2.Ib and it's on MCCC-A\_1083.

## FinalCale 1.04 by SoftWood

There's an update to FinalCale on MCCC-A\_1084. If you have this excellent product, you'll want to get the latest update.

## PageStream 3.0 RTF Filter from SoftLogik

This new filter for PageStream 3.0 is able to read documents from any word processor that supports the new RTF (Rich Text Format) file format. This includes Word and Word Perfect on the PC and Final Writer 5 on the Amiga. Look for it on MCCC-A\_1090.

## Installer version 43.3 from Amiga Technologies

Time to update your system.. Amiga Technologies has been doing something! This new version includes new capabilities not provided in earlier releases. Don't worry about what they are! Just update your system so that the next software you buy will be able to be installed properly. Installer is on MCCC-A\_1091.

## CHAPTER NEWS

## Amiga North Dallas Michael Turner

Many items came up at our April meeting. Here are a few of the more interesting highlights...

MCCC. (Perhaps computer users truly are getting frustrated with PCs...) So be getting all your old hardware and software together! If you have not been to Metcom, it is an event not to be missed.

Naturally, the big news was VIScorp's buyout of Escom's Amiga Technologies for an estimated 40 million dollars. One of our members handed out a newspaper article mentioning Escom's recent money woes. Apparently, Escom sold more than just Amiga Technologies in an effort to get some quick cash. What this means to the much-touted Internet Surfer package is anyone's guess.

Many of the technical questions were concerned with hooking up to the internet. Several questions were asked about connecting to the Internet with PPP and AmiTCP/IP connections. Incidentally, has anyone used the AWeb browser? One member mentioned this at the meeting but no one had seen it. It is a browser that apparently does not need Magic User Interface. Thomas Brooks and Eddie Corr tried to help one member with a problem autobooting harddrives in his A3000. The wealth of technical information that comes out in some of our meetings simply amazes me sometimes. Even if we didn't solve the problem with the harddrive, at least we gave him plenty to think about! Also, sysop Tom Brooks vowed to get his board, A.I., back up and running again. His trusty A3000 finally faltered a little but Tom says his board should be up soon again.

Before we got on to our presentation, MCCC Librarian Ned Kelly mentioned that there will be another Metcom this year! The magic day is Saturday, September 28. It will be held at the Arlington Convention Center, same as last year. Ned had mentioned earlier that at Metcom last year there were many more people who attended than there were members in the

For our presentation Dan Stockelman brought his A4000 and Eddie Corr brought an old harddrive (I think it was a Seagate) and together they were going to demonstrate just how "Plug in and Play" really works. After a couple of moments of working with Eddie's harddrive setting switches, the two connected without a problem and immediately the A4000 recognized the drive in the SCSI port. They also demonstrated the same procedure with an IDE connection. Let's see a PC do that! It took longer to take the whole setup apart than it did to put it together and to get it working!

Last but not least, to the subject of meeting times. Richardson Square Mall is graciously letting us use their Community Room for our monthly meeting place. In order for us to do this, we have to reserve the use of this room. We can only book meetings three months ahead. As other groups also use this room, and it is booked on a first come, first serve basis, occasionally we get bumped. It was generally agreed by all that we would try to book the last Tuesday or Thursday of the month, whatever we could reserve. If you have any questions regarding the meeting date or time please feel free to call myself or Dan Stockelman. In any case, our next meetings are scheduled for May 30 and June 27, both on a Thursday. Meeting time is at 7:30, as always. See Ya' There!!

## Metro C64/128 Mary Louise Hagemeyer

At our April meeting, Mike and Brenda Sessums brought help to those of us who are interested in genealogy. Mike recommended two books: Finding Your Roots by Jeane Eddy Westin, and The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy by Val D. Greenwood. Brenda showed the programs Family Tree from Green Valley Publishing for the C64 and Performer from Loadstar disk #138 which prints family group sheets using GEOS. Because neither of these programs has GEOCOM capabilities, Brenda is tracking down one that does, so that Commodores and PCs can swap data.

Loadstar continues to produce good disks, such as #141 which includes music and graphics programs and a jukebox that plays music with a funny running commentary.

Mike displayed a strange device at the May meeting - a Pentium 133 with CD-ROM that he had built, using determination and several hundred dollars, just so he could demonstrate the Activision Commodore 64 Pack. This is a collection of 15 C64 games, including Little Computer People, Hacker, Portal, and other old favorites. We enjoyed a side-by-side comparison of LCP on the Pentium and a C128. The little guy goes up and down stairs faster on the new version, but the sound effects are better on the old.

There's probably an extension to Murphy's Law that says don't even try to copy and recopy Internet addresses, but we will try to correct a few misprints from the April newsletter. That wasn't a conga line for downloading software; it should have read...

ccnga.uwaterloo.ca Login:anonymous cd/pub/cbm mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu

And the first line for looking for family names was...

It might be better to call Mike Sessums or E-mail him at...

msessums@fastlane.net to clear up any confusion (you're welcome, Mike).
