## METCOM 96

Don't look now, but another METCOM is less than a month away — so prepare yourself for a good time! Now the basics: METCOM will be happening on Saturday, September 28, from 10:00 AM until 5:00 PM, at the Arlington Convention Center, next to the BallPark in Arlington, home of the Texas Rangers. Admission is free - but parking will be $4.00.

## ViScorp at METCOM!?!?

Yes, there is a good possibility VIScorp will have a representative at this year's METCOM. I have spoken to Jason Compton, the editor the Amiga Report International Online Magazine, now an employee of VIScorp. He is willing to attend METCOM and give a talk, but travel arrangements still need to be worked out. Keep your fingers crossed.

## BeBox at METCOM

Not up in the air is the fact we will have a member of the club showing off his very own BeBox computer running an Amiga emulator on it! If you don't know what the BeBox computer is come and find out for yourself. Some people say the BeBox is what the Amiga computer would or should have evolved into had Commodore let it! The times of the BeBox demos are still not definite, but plan to catch it.

## Classes

This year we will be offering two classes, both will be on the InterNet. The morning class will cover InterNet Installation on the Amiga and will run from 10:30 11:30. The afternoon class will cover What to do on the InterNet and will run from 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm. We will have a phone line to surf the Net live. Registration is $5 per class for members and $10 per class for nonmembers. Send your registration fees to the club P.O. Box along with a note stating which class or classes it covers.

## Flea Market

Flea market forms will be available at September chapter meetings. Items will also be collected during the September chapter meetings. If you cannot attend the meetings, the collectors listed below have forms and will take your items. Please call one of them by September 21 to make arrangements for your items.

## Jay Miner Memorial Tape

This year at METCOM the club will be offering a two hour VHS video tape of highlights of past METCOMS and a short club history. The centerpiece of the tape will be Jay Miners' speech and Q&amp;A session at METCOM 89. The cost will be $9.00 for club members. A limited number will be available at the show but if the response is good orders will be taken.

## Other Attractions

We will be having door prize drawings throughout the day. You will need to be present to win. The entire software libraries for the Amiga and the 64/128 will be available. A special on memberships will be offered: thirteen months for the price of twelve months. We are working on getting all of our local dealers to attend METCOM. We also hope to have a few computers set up so you can ask the club's resident gurus for help and advice.

## Help Wanted

Your help is needed to make this year's METCOM a success. We are in need of people to help set-up and to work the Flea Market. If you can help, even if only for 1 or 2 hours, please give me a call at metro (214) 2996824.

So mark your calender for Saturday, September 28. METCOM 96 is almost here!

## Jay Miner Tape

Jay Miner is known as the "father" of the Amiga computer. In 1989, The MCCC invited Jay to speak at METCOM 89. He said "Sure!" and shared with us the story of the birth of the Amiga. His talk and the following question and answer period were captured on video by Brent Wood - at that time, president of the Amiga-By-The Loop Chapter. That tape was among the many archive video tapes of MCCC activity that were reviewed recently and condensed into a lay Miner Memorial. Copies of the tape are available to members and the public for a nominal charge. The tape is not professionally mastered and so it is not glitch free but it does have scrolling commentary and was mastered as SThe session with Jay, the people and events shown, and the memories for some of us far outweigh some of the edit glitches. Standard VHS duplication is planned thru a video studio during the week following this writing, and so copies should be available on or before METCOM 96.

An overview of the tape opens with a brief scrolling textand-music introduction of The Jay Miner Memorial. The video of Jay's session starts with a brief introduction of Jay, then Jay's talk, followed by Q&amp;A's. The next segment of the tape shows video clips of the "First Five METCOM Years" (1987 thru 1991). This has excerpts of talks and demos. For example: ray-tracing by Sculpt's Eric Graham, Amiga Vision, Impact Vision 24, and more. Many people you know are there. Following that sequence is a calendar-style slideshow of "Year 1 Of The First Amiga Chapter Of MCCC" with graphics and HAM pictures. The tape concludes with scrolling credits.

I started to list the names of the members and guests 1 could identify but found that I kept discovering more each time I looked at the tape while I worked on it. I discovered new information each time I watched Jay's talk. There was a lot of good archive video that I wished I could have used, but cut we must. The tape duration is about 1 hour and 45 minutes; over half of which is Jay's session. Maybe if "Version 2.0" is made and done professionally, it could be a lot smoother but this will have to do for now.
