## EZ or ZIP

## Iomega's ZIP and SyQuest's EZ135 compared by Ben Myers - http://www.cnet.com/

omega's ZIP drive and SyQuest's EZ135 probably for a quick fix, they're a dream come true. Iomega and SyQuest have driven down the cost of removable mass-storage drives to around $200 for about 100MB of data capacity, giving you limitless storage at your fingertips for around $20 per 100MB cartridge. We'll give you a close look at the two companies' products and tell you how well, or how poorly, they work.

You use a removable drive the same way you use a floppy; put the cartridge in the drive, copy or write information to or from it, then take it out. Neither the DZ35 nor the ZIP cartridges offer quite the shirt-pocket or purse convenience of a floppy disk, but in their slim carrying cases they're not far behind. The current breed of removable drives boasts smooth installation and convenience and provides decent capacity for the price of both the drive and cartridges.

After installing and testing both the Iomega ZIP drive and the SQuest EZ125 drive, we found that the simplicity of setting up and using the Iomega ZIP drive — coupled with its light weight and slim form - make it the best choice for the road. The SyQuest EZ135 is somewhat bulkier and just slightly more difficult to operate.

We would rather sacrifice the extra 35MB of storage capacity you get with the SyQuest EZ135 for the convenience and superior design of the Iomega ZIP drive. The ZIP's weight is just about half that of the EZ135, and the ZIP is more compact for travel. Best of all, it costs less. The ZIP drive has a familiar feel: a typical power connector, a cartridge that resembles a thick floppy disk, and a floppylike eject button.

## Iomega's ZIP drive

The Iomega ZIP drive's careful design and packaging make it easy to install and use. The drive, available in SCSI and parallel-port models, is list-priced at $199. Both versions are packaged in a neat blue case and have power and drive-busy indicator lights. The drive weighs just over 1 pound, and its separate power transformer weighs the same.

A ZIP cartridge is about 4 inches square — a little larger than a floppy disk and about twice as thick. Each cartridge is list-priced at $19.95 and comes with its own protective jewel case. A ZIP cartridge holds 100MB of data (or 25MB, for a few bucks less).

The SCSI version of the ZIP drive includes a SCSI cable with 25-pin connectors at both ends. This makes it well suited for use with Macs and with PCs that have a SCSI host adapter with a 25-pin external connector. No cable is included for any other type of connection.

The ZIP drive's performance was not spectacular. While it is faster at opening large files than the SyQuest EZ, the ZIP is significantly slower at writing large files and at reading and writing small files.

Installing a SCSI ZIP unit is a snap. First, attach the SCSI cable and power supply. Then set SCSI termination and SCSI ID (limited to addresses 5 or 6) with the toggle switches on the back of the unit. If the ZIP drive is our only external SCSI device or is last in a chain of such devices, set SCSI termination "on" to activate the built-in termination circuits; otherwise, set termination "off."

Price: $199.95

Cartridges: $19.95 each / $49.95 for three

## SyQuest's EZ drive

While SyQuest's EZ135 drives are faster than Iomega's ZIP drives and just as easy to install, they're slightly larger and more expensive. Both of the EZ135 models have a front operational panel that requires some familiarization. You insert an EZ135 cartridge into the drive as you would a floppy disk. The drive's eject lever slides from right to left and may take some effort to move. (An emergency eject hole can be used to remove a

Dallas cartridge when all else fails). The greater storage capacity of the £Z125 drive compensates somewhat for its larger size and different mode of operation.

The external SCSI version, which is not nearly a svelte as its ZIP competitor, caries a street price of $239. The internally mounted IDE version is $199. Single EZ135 cartridges cost $19.95 each. Each cartridge comes with its own padded plastic carrying case.

The external EZ135 drive weighs about 2 pounds; its power supply weighs 1.6 pounds. SyQuest packages the SCSI version with a SCSI terminator and a SCSI cable that has a 25-pin connector on one end and a 50-pin connector on the other. The cable is suitable for use with a Mac or an IBM-compatible SCSI adapter with a 25-pin external port. The SCSI drive has two 50-pin Centronicsstyle SCSI connectors on back, and a dial for the SCSI device ID. It is not backward compatible with SyQuest's earlier and very popular 44MB or 88MB cartridges.

## UnZIPed

why i replaced my ZIP drive by Victor Serbe, CUCUG

dumped my ZIP drive (returned it to Best Buy) light of what I replaced it with. I was browsing the Elek-Tek stores in Chicago during my business trip this week and found they had the new SyQuest EZ135's in stock. The reasons I switched:

- It has 1/2 the access time (13ms).
- It has more than twice the xfer rate (1.4 - 2.4 MB sustained).
- It is NOT limited to only SCSI ID's 5 and 6 (a pain for me).

In our tests, the SyQuest drives performed much · It has a normal 50-pin (Centronics type) SCSI faster than the ZIP drives except in opening large files. connectors.

- Setting up the SCSI version of the EZ135 is · It uses physical write protect (rather than software based).

straightforward; just connect a SCSI cable between your SCSI adapter and the EZ135 drive, dial a unique SCSI · The medium costs the same but is 135MB instead of device ID, plug in the power supply transformer, and attach the SCSI terminator to the second SCSI port on the 100MB. · It has twice the warranty period. back of the drive. · (Subjective) It feels like it's made better.

Price: $239

Cartridges: $19.95

Thoughts for The Month

Lous conquers all things except poverty and a toothachs.

A definition of endless Lous: Stevis Wonder and Ray Charles playing tennis.

All this, and the drive only costs $39 more than the ZIP drive.

Only real downside is that, since it uses a real hard medium, the eject system is a little more complicated (push a button and then flip a lever instead of simply pushing a button).

However, the thing is BAD FAST (also has local cache). Next, I plug it into the Amiga and check it out. I'm seriously considering using it as a multiboot device! I loaded up my EZ on the A3000 last night and found out that it blew the doors off my internal Quantum PRO52S! Its raw transfer rate was nearly double the Quantum's at about 25% of the CPU overhead, and in real world operational tests, it was noticeably faster. It's plenty fast for the A3000.

I think I've found my new Amiga drive.

Next, cross-platform compatibility: It also works great with MessyDOS and Winslow. In fact, all my fave games (big disk hogs) will move over to the EZ and I'll happily play directly from it.

Also, I just updated to the latest CrossDOS, so file transfer from the Internet will be fast with this thing. Just save it on my PC and then walk it over to the Amiga and copy it in. Neeeeto.

## LIST PRICE

Diavolo backup v3.0 Pro: $US90/DM135

Diavolo Backup v3.0:

$US64/DM98

Upgrades between different versions of the program (including from vl.x to v3.x) simply cost the difference between their original prices.

Diavolo is not widely available, and therefore a credit card purchase proved the simplest way for me to to buy it (with the automatic currency exchange it allows) from its German distributor. I believe a UK distributor is being negotiated.

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

2MB RAM minimum (FAST RAM recommended).

Hard disk(s) Hard disk installation requires approximately 1.1MB available disk space. Floppy installation also possible (see below).

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Selected XPK libraries provided for data compression and encryption capability (NUKE, FAST, FEAL)

Works under all AmigaDOS revisions including and after v2.04.

## COMPATIBILITY

Works on 68k family of Motorola processors, including 060.

- OpalVision, Electronic Design Y/C Genlock, C= 1084s monitor
- Various video peripherals, Sunrise AD1012, HP LeJ4L, printer, ZyXEL U-1496e+ modem etc

## INSTALLATION

Installation is easily accomplished using the supplied standard Installer and script. The Installer intelligently checks the versions of any currently installed libraries.

The installation process offers the (recommended) option to create an Emergency Boot Floppy Disk. This can also be performed at any other time by simply clicking on the "MakeBootDisk" icon that is always available in the Diavolo directory. It is recommended that this is performed AFTER Diavolo has been configured for your system, so that the appropriate preferences are included on the floppy disk. The Emergency Floppy Installation took about 905K of floppy disk space on a 1.76MB floppy disk, due to its intelligently including my CyberGraphX libraries in the installation (very nice touch IMO). CyberGraphX users without high-density floppy drives should temporarily remove the cybergraphics.library, and set their screen mode to an appropriate ECS/AGA screenmode before making the 880K boot floppy disk. This will allow the successful creation of an 880K Emergency Boot Disk. Non-CyberGraphX users should have no problem creating an 880K Emergency Boot Floppy Disk as long as only ONE monitor is selected when the choice is presented. The author is currently looking into a better

method of performing this installation, due to the current limitations presented by the standard Installer given the wide variety of system configurations currently in use.

## CONFIGURATION

On first running the program, you can use "Auto Configuration" (in the "Diavolo Streamer tape / Removable medium settings" configuration section) to automatically "tune" your configuration. This tests each SCSI ID on every installed host it detects in the system for tape streamers. On finding one, it asks whether you wish to accept the device, or continue the search.

On the user accepting the device found, Diavolo then asks for media to be inserted so that it can test the device for supported commands and features (eg., fast seek, direct seek, update in place) etc. It also warns that any data on the tape will be destroyed in the process. This process can be aborted at any stage before any writing is actually performed, but the supported features will not have been determined if you do.

As well as auto-configuration capability, it is also possible to specify drive type. This addresses known problems with the C= 3070 (Caliper) streamer (if you use this device, specify QIC 150/250. Other users will be well served by the auto-configuration option).

Diavolo Pro also comes with API (Application Programming Interface) capability, with a sample program, DBCLICtrl, included. DBCLICtrl allows the launching of backup sessions via the CLI, and therefore from Cron events etc, including full control over desired filters, log files and error reports etc.

## MAIN REVIEW

There are many aspects of the program that, for one reason or another, 1 am unable to test. I refer to its advertised ability to:

- backup AFS and MuFS filesystems
- backup hard and soft-links
- backup VLAB Motion's MovieShop(tm) projects
- backup to removable media (without using filesystem), eg., SyQuest, ZIP, Bernoulli etc

Note: a README file that arrived with the registered distribution warned that the capability to backup/restore multi-assignments was temporarily broken and therefore disabled in this release. The author has subsequently mused that unless users show a specific interest in this feature, it will possibly not be included due to the complexity of the task, and the fact that it was not even used by owners of previous versions when it was available. However, he remains open to suggestions from users regarding this matter. Personally, while the feature sounds "cool", I do not see myself needing it, even though I do use multi-assignments (for fonts, cand libs) on my system. What I have tested:

- backup to mixed 880K/1.76MB floppy disks in one session
- backup to multiple disk files
- backup to SCSI-2 Exabyte 4200c 4mm DAT streamer
- equivalent restore operations to the above items

## INTERFACE

Diavolo sports an attractive, system complaint GUI and menu interface, offering extensive keyboard as well as mouse control over its features. It is responsive and extremely informative about all facets of operation. There is always something there to let you know exactly what the status of the program is, and how it is/has performed.

Diavolo has full public and custom screen support, and allows the selection of the font used, as well as filesystem (1.3, 2.0-&gt;3.0, 3.1 or better), byte display (MB or K), directory tree structure, packet I/O, autocompare and buffer size.

The interface offers full MagicWB support if MagicWB is detected on the system. It sports attractive imagery for the three main Backup, Restore and Compare options, as well as imagery on the individual media backup/restore screens (including very neat representations where multiple media is required for a specified backup session). However, for those that choose not to use it, MagicWB is certainly not a requirement. Intelligent palette handling is provided for standard screens down to 4 colours for the imagery.

Many options available from the GUI are also selectable from the menu, which also offers items for generating file lists, error reports and clearing the file and selection lists. Complete control over a tape streamer is provided in the Rewind, Retense, Eject and Erase menu items, as well as Show Tape Contents and Rebuild Tape Index options. The window that opens on the WB can also be snapshot, freed (defaults back to centre screen) and zipped (shows title bar with useful status information (current operation, % completed etc).

The Global Configuration menu item provides control over several aspects of Diavolo's overall operation. Since Diavolo performs its duties using several cooperative tasks (rather than one single one) you can control the priorities of Hard-disk, (Un)Packing and Backup Medium tasks. While I have left these at the default "0" priority, the author says that under certain circumstances (particularly when backing up to disk), some performance improvement can be obtained by increasing the Backup Medium task priority by 1. Obviously, if you wanted to perform a backup while multitasking with an even less CPU intensive task than Diavolo, you can also reduce these priorities accordingly for smooth multi-tasking.

For those interested in automatic and intelligent handling of task priorities and efficient multi-tasking, I recently installed Executive (the new task/priority management system) on my machine, and found that Diavolo was perfectly happy with its auto-management of the task priorities. While I did not note the priorities Executive actually set for the tasks (probably around -77), there was certainly no performance loss, and multitasking remained smooth and efficient. Settings can be Loaded and Saved.

## BACKUP

I have found that best performance on my configuration is obtained with an I/O buffer of 8MB FAST RAM. All tests described below were conducted with such a buffer.

Without being able to actually test certain devices and machine configurations, I might anticipate that a slower QIC streamer, for instance, may well achieve maximum performance with only, say, 4MB FAST RAM buffers, though this would also be greatly affected by the CPU of the host machine, especially if compression is used. Floppy backups will probably work at more or less full speed with almost any reasonably sized buffer on almost any CPU.

The backup configuration window offers the usual array of choices over compression (including XPK compression type and amount), media checks, setting of protection bits, passwords, encryption library, and whether to save hard-linked dirs and files.

General Feedback (backup screen) includes: Directory (name), File (name), Directories read (#), Directories left (#), Files read (#), files left (A), Bytes read (#), Bytes left (#), Packer (XPK name), Gain (kB), Compression (%), Disks to go (#), Disks done (#), Elapsed (hh:mm:ss), Speed (kB/min), and To go (hh:mm:ss). Note: the Speed (kB/min) indicator shows real-time performance. ie., in accordance with the types of data being backed up, this figure will rise and fall (eg., higher with ASCII and executables, lower with compressed graphics, LHA archives etc). Comprehensive statistical averages are provided at the end of each session in a separate requester. The speed results below are taken from the statistical averages.

Floppy: (Supports 4 floppy drives)

no compression/verify = 600K/min XPK NUKE 100%/verify = 1000K/min

XPK NUKE 100%/no verify = 1700K/min

Note: while the 3rd test certainly returned impressive speed, I would not recommend it due to the vulnerable integrity of floppy disk media in general. It is provided for reference only.

Disk files:

5MB/min (backup to same partition) 15MB/min (backup to different partition)

Exabyte 4200c 4mm DAT streamer: 13MB/min to 15MB/min

File Selection:

Diavolo offers several methods of defining which partitions or directories to backup, including "drag'n'drop"ing WB icons onto the backup window, filters, selecting partitions from the backup list view, or from a "Directory" gadget on the backup window (using system requester).

Filters are configured by "macro recording" your selection of partitions from the listview. Once done, this means that if you have a complex combination of partitions as part of a normal backup procedure, you simply select the filter you want to use by using the "Filter" gadget on the backup window (or the filter options of the DBCLICtrl command or the Scheduler GUl), and the appropriate selections are scanned for backing up. The simple command format used by the filters is covered in the manual, so you can also easily create or modify your own filter scripts in any text editor. Filter scripts are used to create permanent, simple or complex, selection criteria for re use.

Initially, I could not find a way to determine the order in which partitions selected for backup were actually processed. Ie., no matter what order I selected them in, they were processed in the order in which AmigaDOS presents them to Diavolo. In my case, this was exactly the reverse of what I wanted. The author replied to my query regarding this with the explanation that if DEVICENAME is used instead of VOLUMENAME, the order in which they are processed can indeed be controlled. While some requester replacements will not allow the manual entry of a DEVICENAME (will automatically revert it to its VOLUMENAME), others will, so that the order can often be determined via the "Directory" gadget. When using Filters, simply edit with any text editor, and replace VOLUMENAMES with their DEVICENAMES, and arrange the order of processing to suit your needs.

Scheduling:

Diavolo Pro also sports a full-featured scheduling program and daemon for auto execution of backup sessions. Since I only backup about once per week, I see little reason to leave a 32K daemon running in memory all the time (the same goes for Ami-Back), and was therefore grateful for the DBCLICtrl program that allowed simple execution from the Cron program I already have running for the scheduling of many other system maintenance and communications tasks.

However, the Scheduler does offer some extra features, in the form of "late backups" and unusual schedules like "every Ist Monday in the month" and "2nd and last Sunday in the month". The "late backup" option allows for prompting the user on turning on the machine as to whether he wishes to perform the backup that was missed while the machine was turned off. Certainly a unique and potentially very useful feature (eg., after some unexpected downtime).

## Compression:

The XPK libraries NUKE, FAST and FEAL are provided in the installation. It is not recommended to use other XPK libraries for various reasons, including a minor bug in the xpkmaster.library itself, which these three supplied libraries compensate for. Other XPK libraries can be used, but the author states that in these cases, all backups MUST immediately be compared to ensure backup integrity. Experimentation with various combinations of compression (XPK only, XPK + hardware, hardware only [available on my Exabyte 4200c DAT streamer]) produced interesting, though I would not necessarily say conclusive, results. I found XPK NUKE with hardware compression turned off to provide the fastest results. I do not know enough about this technology to know the whys or wherefores, but this certainly appeared to provide the fastest delivery of data to the tape streamer, as surprised as I was by the result. I repeat that I do not consider my tests in this regard as

conclusive.

Since hardware compression provides no feedback of the final compression ratio, it cannot be compared to the XPK results, which (using NUKE 100%) provided 18% compression on data predominantly comprised of graphics (mostly JPEG, GIF and IFF24), animations to 24-bits, audio samples to 16-bits, and LHA archives. About 20% consisted of executables and their attendant accessories. I noted that on tests involving executables and text only, NUKE 100% achieved compression rates of up to 51%, while even spreads of data types seemed to produce averages around 34%.

## Appending Backups:

If the option to overwrite an existing backup has not been explicitly chosen, Diavolo presents a graphical representation of a backup media's contents once it has read the media's index. This offers easy to read feedback of the media's contents, allowing you to select from which point you wish to append the next write operation, eg., (for DAT streamers) from the beginning, or after backup session 1, or 10, or whatever you desire. Since QIC drives cannot overwrite parts of a tape's contents, this representation offers either complete overwrite, or append from the end of existing data only for these drives. This implementation is remarkably simple and effective, leaving the user confident of the status of the backup media and its contents.

## • COMPARE/RESTORE

The restore configuration window offers the expected options regarding the restoration of dirs/files from a backup, including "ask beforereplacing", "keep existing", "replace existing", "replace older", "rename existing", and "rebuild dir structure".

The General Feedback (compare screen) includes: Directory (name), File (name), Directories read (#), Directories left (#), Files compared (#), Mismatched files (#), Bytes compared (#), Newer files (#), Unreadable files (#), Fileheader mismatch (#), Missing files (#), Identical files (#), Disks to go (#), Disks done (#), Elapsed (hh:mmiss), Speed (kB/min), and To go (hh:mm:ss).

## Floppy:

no compression/verify = 1300K/min XPK NUKE 100%/verify = 1700K - 2000K/min

XPK NUKE 100%/no verify = 1700K - 2000K/min

## Disk files:

5MB/min (backup to same partition) 15MB/min (backup to different partition)

Exabyte 4200c 4mm DAT streamer: 6MB/min to 14MB/min

As a further test, I selected 3 files within a 750MB archive to restore. The files were small, and each located several directories deep and 200MB to 300MB apart in the backed up file system. Diavolo located and restored all 3 files within the space of 1 (ONE) minute using the DAT

streamer's direct seek capability. Since QIC drives do not support direct seek, Diavolo will take as long as it takes to locate each file sequentially as it scans the backup data to perform this operation.

## DOCUMENTATION

Currently, the manual is only available in German. For this reason I requested that I forego a manual until the English one is finished. In the interim I have only the demo version's supplied readme for documentation, and the author's answers to my queries. The English manual is expected to be available November '95.

## LIKES

What's not to like?

Specifically, I like the interface, the speed, what appears to be an excellent SCSI(2) implementation (ie., the program talks and listens to the system and device drivers carefully and comprehensively), the features and options available, as well as the extensive statistical and status information and feedback during operation. I also like the active and ongoing development and support the pedoment and supert ti program enjoys from it's author.

## DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

I wouldn't actually call it a dislike, since it doesn't impact on my own system, however the executable size of 510K may well impact on RAM availability on less well endowed machine configurations. However, I might also speculate that many users backing up to faster media (therefore requiring optimum RAM butters for greatest throughput) will often have the appropriate RAM resources available to them. I might similarly speculate that users of low-end machines, ie., those less likely to have the RAM resources for large buffers, will generally use slower backup mediums (requiring much smaller buffers). There are always exceptions to rules however.

Regardless of these matters, the executable is big, and on raising this matter with the author, he stated that making the program more modular is already a priority for a future revision of the program, thereby reducing the RAM overhead of the program's tasks during operation. This is good news and serves only to make what is already a superb application even better.

## COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

Over the years I have used Quarterback v3, v4 and v5, and Ami-Back v2 (to 2.0h, I couldn't use the "i" patch). Quarterback dropped out of the race ages ago when AmiBack, with its speed, multiple partition and append backup support, arrived on the scene. Diavolo, similarly, takes up where Ami-Back left off. Speed of operation is similar to Ami-Back, however Diavolo's system compliance, features, controls and feedback are far superior. Ami-Back seems to achieve highest speeds using reasonably small buffers (I used 2 x 1MB buffers), whereas for Diavolo to reach a similar operating speed as Ami-Back on my DAT drive, a buffer of about 8MB is required. I believe this is due to the design of the program (eg., multipletasks etc), and also provides benefits in other

areas of operation (eg., more efficient multi-tasking).

Speaking of which, Diavolo is also superior to AmiBack during multi-tasking (regardless of the recent installation here of Executive, as mentioned previously, which is designed to streamline multi-tasking operations system-wide), with even screen blankers able to continue smoothly where Ami-Back causes blanker "stuttering" (system Blanker and MultiCXblanker) during backup/restore operations. Another thing I really like compared to Ami-Back (it used to annoy the hell out of me), is that if a backup is aborted for any reason, the current selection of partitions, directories and files is retained and available for immediate re-use. Ami-Back always dumped the whole scan in this situation, meaning that a restart always meant from the very beginning (a total pain on backups containing 25,000+ files or measured in the hundreds of MB).

## BUGS

No bugs encountered whatsoever. In all aspects the program has behaved as expected since installation (approximately 2 months and 20 or so backups).

## VENDOR SUPPORT

I started communicating with the author some time before this new version of the program was released (I have not used previous versions), after I had been told of it's imminent release (I was tired of Ami-Back, couldn't install the lastest'patch, and missed product support and development). He has been prompt and courteous in all correspondence, and answered any questions in depth. I have no reason to doubt that after sales support would elicit the same service.

I have absolutely no connection with the author or his agents except as a happy customer. This review is an entirely independent initiative.

## WARRANTY

The usual disclaimers apply (ie., all efforts are made to make the program bug free etc...no responsibility for lost or damaged data assumed etc).

## CONCLUSIONS

If you're after a serious, well presented, reliable, feature laden and yet remarkably easy to use data backup program (that also happens to enjoy continuing development and support) for your system, Diavolo is a "must have" IMO.

Diavolo v3.0 Pro is an excellent product, and is currently (IMHO) by far the best available for backing up your Amiga system's data. I rate it as a high quality and professional computer tool that enhances the Amiga system in usage, security and profile. If the manual is as well thought out and implemented as the software, I have no hesitation in rating the program: 4.8 out of 5. In fact, it's hard not to award Diavolo 5 out of 5 for the thought and effort that has gone into its creation. However some room must be left for possible future enhancements.

## Quarterback 6.1

new version of a standard a press release

PUBLISHER: Quasar Distribution, P.O. Box 188, Southland, Victoria 3192, Australia.

While hard drives represent some of the highest technology that exists in the computer industry, all hard drives will eventually fail. It is not a matter of if, but simply a question of when. If you've invested hours creating pictures, manuscripts, 3-D ray-traces, or spreadsheets, then you need some way to protect your investment. Quarterback gives you that protection by safeguarding your work against any possible loss.

## Features:

- Backup to or restore from floppy disks, high density floppies, hard disks, hard disk partitions, AmigaDOS files, removable media, tape drives, and any AmigaDOS compatible devices.
- Support for special features of newer, more advanced tape drives. There is support for hardware-based compression, fast tape advance, and quick erase features.
- Automatically formats floppies as it writes.
- Support for multiple tapes per backup session. This means that you can backup the entire contents of very large hard disks onto several smaller-sized tapes.
- Complete or Selective backups and restores. A powerful Tag Filter allows you to include or exclude files by name (with wild cards), date, or archive bit.
- Optional password protection and encryption, to give you the best in security.
- Full macro and ARexx support, allowing you total control over the Quarterback program.
- Fast compression during backups. In many cases, Quarterback can compress the data as fast as it can be written to your floppy drive.
- Save to a file or print catalogs or session logs.
- Innovative "Interrogator" retrieves device information from SCSI devices.
- Can verify data as it is written.
- Automatically detects and warns about bad media during backup and restore.

## Amiga Library News

public domain and shareware picks from Bill Raecke

It usually pays to stay current. There are several updates to programs this month; both commercial and public domain/shareware. On disk MCCC-A \_991 you'll find an update to take CrossDOS to version 6.03. On that same disk is another patch to take CrossMAC to version 1.05. On MCCC-A\_1000 is a patch to update FinalCalc to version 1.03. And on MCCC-A\_1010 is an update to bring CyberGraphX to version 2.15. By the way, this patch works for both the commercial version and the distributable version of the software.

On MCCC-A\_1011 you'll find the latest version of Virus\_Checker, the most popular virus protection utility out there.

For all of you Infocom fans, MCCC-A\_998 has the latest version (4.1) of the Infocom Interpreter. This little program allows you to play all your favorite Infocom games on your Amiga through a very nice interface — even some games that were never released for the Amiga.

Most of you probably know by now that the best BoulderDash clone for the Amiga is DiamondCaves. On disk MCCC-A \_1007 is the latest version of that program, 2.3. If you haven't taken a look at this game yet, it's time to check it out. If you have an earlier version, it's time to update.

## The Star Wars Trilogy

Here's something different for all you Star Wars fans. There are four archives on disk MCCC-A 994. The first three contain the entire screenplays for the Star Wars Trilogy: "A New Hope", , "The Empire Strikes Back" and "The Return of the Jedi". The fourth archive contains a list of small bloopers and inconsistancies that made it onto the screen. Someone has a lot of time on their hands.

## ABackup by Denis Gounelle and Reza Elghazi

Here is something everyone should have and use, but few seem to bother. Let me add my voice to the chorus. Your hard drive is going to fail. That is not an opinion or something that could happen..it's a certainty. The only real question is when. If you ask around at any of the meetings you'll find a number of people who have had experience. You'll also find that about half of them didn't have current backups when it happened. Let me tell you, restoring your system from scratch isn't a lot of fun. It's all a lot simpler if all you have to do is reformat your hard drive and restore from your current backup or - worst case — buy à new hard drive and restore from your current backup.

ABackup makes this all a lot easier. The version here is fully functional. If you intend to use it you are obligated to send $20 to the authors. $20 is a price anyone can afford. For your money you get a fully featured backup program with all the bells and whistles anyone could want. Ive done a great deal of experimenting with it and have found it to be a very reliable product. If you are backing up to floppies, ABackup is probably as good a product as you're likely to find. If you have a SyQuest, a ZIP drive or a tape drive, you may want to consider one of the commercial products such as Quarterback or Diavolo Backup mentioned elsewhere in this newsletter. My own tests have shown Quarterback to be many times faster than ABackup when working without compression to a fast medium. On floppies, however, you will find no such speed advantage since all of these products are limited by the speed of the floppies themselves. A backup to floppies, although time consuming, is better than no backup at all. Check out ABackup. It's on MCCC-A

## CyberShow by Helmut Hoffman

This is an outstanding picture viewing utility. It's designed for users of the CyberGraphX graphics system. It shows pictures in windows on the screen of your choice or on its own custom screen. Any number of colors can be utilitzed right on up to the 16,777,216 color "True Color" mode. The version here is partially disabled in that it will only display in gray-scale. The fully functioning version is only $25. That may seem like a lot, but if you look at the SPEED at which it goes about its business you'll probably find it's worth the investment. I did. Check out the demo version on MCCC-A\_1002.

## Amiga By-The-Loop

Johnny Kitchens

With January, we get to start a new year. It will be a new year for many things. It is an election year so a new president could be in the works. Several celebrities will be reaching their 50th birthday this year. It is hard to imagine Sally Field hitting the big 50! Probably most important of all, the Amiga will enter the start of a new decade. The Amiga turned 10 last summer with considerable changes taking place all around it. Taken under the wing of a new company, the Amiga faces a different future, one that improves with each passing day. The new owners have a huge hill to climb to get things moving in a positive direction, but they have taken the first steps. 1996 returned the Amiga to the dealer's shelves here locally, the most positive move yet! Pay a visit to Metropolitan and see the 4000T for yourself, and take a moment to thank them for staying with the Amiga. It looks as if January will be the start of a very good year.

4000T in stock, and you can touch one! Southwestern Bell has lowered the cost of getting ISDN to your house. We had a few questions pop up tonight, that kept us talking awhile. Where can you find Amiga dealers in the area? There are just four in Texas so far. According to the distributor there are two in Dallas! A question on ARexx programming was next. Did he get the right answer? Next came a question on how to get an Internet account. Several sources were mentioned. A question on the feasibility of refilling ink cartridges for printers was asked. That can be a messy topic in the wrong hands. A question about DCTV was passed around next. A question on PageStream updates made the rounds as usual. Seems we may be talking about that subject forever. How long will it be till 3.1 shows up? Finally, the best question of the night, I thought, was asked. What kind of software is there for the Amiga to access the Internet? That can be so confusing.

This month David Owens started the meeting by telling us what to look forward to seeing next month: a presentation on the operations of a local BBS that is of interest to the Amiga users in the area. This should be of great interest to club members. With that, David issued a plea for volunteers to make some presentations at our meetings. If you have gotten something great to demonstrate, or a skill to show off, then give David Owens a call. I am sure you will get plenty of appreciation from him as well as a sigh of relief. We had few announcements tonight of interest. Startext is looking for beta testers for its Internet software. Contact Okley Moss for further information on that.

As previously mentioned, Metropolitan does indeed have the

Tonight, David Owens again took his Amiga from its cozy place in his home to our meeting place to show off a piece of software that is a necessity, but no one wants to use it 'til they need it. It is ABackUp, which recently became available in our library. It is a professional piece of backup software that everyone can probably use sometime in their yearly ritual of using their computer. A real showpiece of non-commercial software if ever there was one.

Finally, I would like to say one last thing about January: it's usually cold. The night of the meeting was no exception -- only I never expected it inside! Someone at the Community Center decided that turning on the air conditioning full blast was a good idea. It actually felt warmer outside than inside. I hope the air conditioning works that well in August!

## Amiga North Dallas Michael Turner

Because the Richardson Square Mall was still wrapping their customer's Christmas gifts, our annual December meeting and Christmas party was held at Dan Stockelman's house. Everyone brought along their favorite game and their computer to show it. I don't remember the last time I saw so many Amigas in one area at the same time. Just as amazing were all the favorite munchies that everybody brought. Chips, popcorn, soda, and even sandwiches were present. After all the food was set out and the computers were hooked up, everybody sat down to play their favorite shoot-'em-up. Just then Eddie called the meeting to order.

The most important business of the month was the election of new officers. Here is the newly elected slate for Amiga North Dallas:

President

Treasurer

Librarian

Secretary

Dan Stockelman

Gus Reiter

Thomas Dye

Michael Turner

We are still looking for a VicePresident. Any takers? C'mon, the job's not that hard! If you're interested, give one of the above a call.

After two hours of shooting monsters, blowing down buildings, finding magic keys and cruising the Internet it was time for us to leave so Dan could get some sleep in order to function at work the next morning. Many thanks need to go out to Dan for not only graciously extending us the use of his home but also for providing enough extra chairs and tables to use for the meeting.

Our January meeting was held at our normal meeting place at the Community Room in Richardson Square Mall. First up on the meeting was, of course, News and

## CHAPTER NEWS

Rumors. Mostly the talk concerned various Amiga Dealers. The Amiga, the times for the computer being what they are, can be a hard computer to get supplies for. However, Eddie brought a copy of the Amiga Shopper 1996 that lists dealers around the country for the Amiga community. He also brought several magazines from Europe to show us. After several members answered my questions concerning adding a second harddrive, and after Ned patiently answered my questions above setting up my Lynx configuration (it must have seemed I showed up just to bombard them with questions this meeting), John Cummings was finally able to start his presentation.

John brought his Amiga tower that he had built himself. This tower housed two CD,ROM drives, a tape back-up drive and an external floppy drive all in a neat compact case. Our presenter opened his case up and demonstrated how he had wired everything up and how a basic SCSI interface works. After graciously answering another barrage of questions from yours truly, John showed us several CD-ROMS he had brought with him. He also demonstrated Asim CD-ROM and FastPrefs 2.0, which he uses as drivers for the tower. Finally, while John was showing us some of the amazing amount of files available for the Amiga on CD-ROM, the security guard for the mall popped his head in the door and casually mentioned that the mall would be closing. It definitely was time for us to leave. Thanks need to go out to John for bring out his equipment and showing us how he built his tower. Gus Rieter also mentioned that he had picked up a videotape of the last days, hours, minutes, seconds at Commodore and would bring it to our next meeting. Should be kinda interestin. See Ya'll There!

## Metro C64/128

Mary louise Hagemeyer

In January, we discussed where to find things for our 8-bit computers. When one member said he had been looking for books about the C128, someone else said she had found them at Half-Price Books, under a stack of other books. Double-density disks may be hard to find in stores, but are available by mail.

One of our members has written a program that sounds very interesting. Bernie Wilson, as a volunteer for COPS (Citizens on Patrol) in Benbrook, receives a monthly listing of all the police reports for his area. He enters the information into his C128, sorts and interprets it, and prints out reports for other volunteers to use on patrol. He really likes the way the advanced features of BASIC 7.0 make it easier to write and modify a program. Bernie has found a program called 5x125 Directory which squeezes mass quantities of disk directories onto a page with 5 columns by 125 lines.

Be sure to come to our February 10 meeting and bring your computer problems, samples of work in progress, or programs to share.

## Battery Problems Revisited — by Johnny Kitchens

Thorn on bat ba on popping up during our meetings lately. In the December newsletter, an article appeared concerning battery leakage and the destruction it can cause. As a coincidence, a fellow member had suffered just this fate. As the word spread through the ranks, so did the fear. Trust me, this can be a serious problem to face. I've seen it myself.

The problem may not be as serious as the article tried to make it out to be though. The ones who need to worry are those who may use their computer infrequently, buy a computer from someone who has stopped using it for awhile, or never check their clock. A frequent user will keep his battery charged up, and if he keeps an eye on his clock for the proper time, he'll be ready for the impending death of his battery. NiCad batteries, as well as any other kind, have a tendency to leak after being left in a state of discharge for a long period of time, just the sort of situation you will get from setting around not being used. The one I saw was a 500 with a lithium battery on its memory board. It had set for about a year unused.

The battery in the 2000 and 3000 is a stack of batteries held together by a vinyl wrap. When one dies it stops the flow of current usually and the clock stops keeping time when you power down. I've noticed a few people who don't keep an eye on the clock, and don't notice it's showing the wrong time, even though they are daily users of their computer. They are asking for the problem to strike. A clock not keeping proper time is your first warning of this problem.

But even if your clock shows the wrong time, don't panic immediately. It could be the game you played. One of my favorites keeps setting the time wrong regularly. If you have that, set the time and check it the next day. If it's still wrong, it's time to worry. The battery isn't easy to change, but it's not impossible. On the other hand, changing the battery now means more time not to worry. Just keep an eye on the time!
